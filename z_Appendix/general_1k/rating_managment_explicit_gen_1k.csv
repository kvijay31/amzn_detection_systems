R3QLEXR780PR7J,"When travelling the States (frequently coming over from Europe) it's hard to avoid Randy Travis on any of the stations, and I must admit that I have hummed along to a lot of his songs, too. Even bought a CD in 1998 because of the strength of hits such as as ""Digging' up Bones"" and ""Out of My Bones"".As a music fan, I've always loved live recordings, so I went and bought this one recently. Randy Travis admittedly has got a remarkable voice, but after three or four tracks (and strangely they all clock in at exactly 3 minutes) I found the individual songs pretty much alike, be it his recently Gospel-flavored stuff or older hits, not too much variety here. The arrangements are C&W-neat but sterile throughout, including the one-liners between songs.I really love handmade country music, but this recording (as well as the DVD) offer just too little variation to anybody but the dedicated fan. Other great live performers with roots in Country Music (be sure to check out Willie Nelson, Dan Fogelberg or John Denver concert recordings) give their audiences an evening of Country PLUS Blues, Rock, Pop - whatever, and they've also had a hand in writing their own stuff, while Randy Travis basically just interprets the same three-minute song over and over again (custom-written by others).With a great voice like his, Randy Travis could and should really aim for higher ground. Sorry if anybody feels annoyed by this, but not all of the ratings can be 5-stars :-)",0,0

R1XTGRRXJ09XH9,"Loved the book. Big sci-fi fan, but one of the worst movies ever. Saw it when it came out. Not one person I knew liked it back then so I am shocked so many rave reviews today. Can’t believe this movie could improve with age. Does a lousy wine improve with age? Can only think it makes you sound like you are cool - like marvelling at most abstract art. Movie was widely criticised at the time except I remember they tried to applaud Sting. You see where his film career went. Long, boring pile.",0,0
R35Z797JE25J5B,"Dune, uncut, is a classic.  This sliced-and-diced widescreen version dropped at least two vital sequences (I haven't had the time to look for more). ***SPOILER ALERT*** First, Paul's call-out fight upon his and Jessica's first ecounter with the Fremen, the transfer of responsibility for the children of the slain Fremen and the passage of his water to Paul for safekeeping for the Tribe limns the character of the Fremen and their relationship to tradition and water -- a must for better understanding of actions to follow.  ***SPOILER ALERT***  Also cut was the process of removing the bile of the infant worm (The Water of Life).  It's origin is vital to understanding one facet of the planet's importance to the Bene Gesserit and the relationship between the worms and the mystical culture surrounding them.  Again, widescreen is nice but why, oh why, for a few cents' worth of tape, did they cut anything? The original, albeit in TV format, deserves a full row of stars.",0,0
R2CA4E6DOFCIYJ,"A loose stool of a book. Unreadable. A chaos of very badly written over-excited adolescent twaddle.

R1M3IDMQ6C2FLH,"I saw this book in the store, and I bought it because of the cool cover art and because I love stories with dragons. But I have to say, I'll be more careful next time. Unfortunately, the book is so obviously ""lifted"" from Lord of the Rings (with a dash of Star Wars) that it's just frustratingly difficult to read. The main character, Eragon (AKA ""Aragorn"" from Lord of the Rings), sets off on a quest to overthrow the evil ruler of a land that resembles Middle Earth (as seen in the Tolkien-esque map provided at the beginning of the book) with the help of an old magician, Brom (AKA Gandalf). Sound familiar? Well, the rest of the story will, too.Given his age, Christopher Paolini is a great writer, and he has very good potential, but he's still in the beginning stages of writing where one imitates the great writers. Once he finds his own voice, he'll probably blow our socks off. But in the meantime, save your money! Or, better yet, spend it on a better investment--Lord of the Rings.",0,0

R3LBCHB3R3ONHP,This book is so poorly written that If I had been teaching at any University it would not have garnered an F. I found nine errors in the introductory page and it got worse from there. This man is not qualified to write anything on this subject and mixes all sorts of terms up and has misassumptions abounding. Those who wrote all these glowing reviews on this book are obviously worse educated than Mr Fischer is. This is a real indictment on the state of education in the world I can tell you that. I have a review just of the introductory section which is rife with errors on the web. Just search for writings by me and you'll find it. I didn't feel a need to waste 500 pages on writing a review on a poorly written book. Roy Blizzard IIIOn facebook or on the web,0,0
R2WTAFM1AR9ITP,"After watching the first 10 minutes there is at least two dozens deaths (animated deaths but deaths none the less) and it just shocked me how can a movie like this be rated G. Which demographic are this people aiming to? A 1960's based spy movie? Are they serious? Of course people are going to say ""Get a life. There's death and violence in the real world, kids should be prepared to accept death as natural part of life, blah blah blah"". But what's the message in this movie? Bad people lose, good looking people win? That's the Disney motto, not Pixar's. This sequel does not compare to the Toy Story sequels if you're going to name other sequels made by Pixar.  The original plot was about character development, friendship, being humble, recognizing ones faults and growing up.  This movie is just an action movie not a family movie. I was disappointed to see that John Lasseter contributed to the story of this movie and it is a shame since this movie differs so much from the first one that one can only think that he was ordered to produce a sequel. Mr Lasseter, if you're not on the Board you just are an employee; forget whatever title they give.  If the movie does not sell you'll be held accountable and fired a second time from the same company. Seems that the winning streak of Pixar has ended. Better luck next time.P.S.  ""Planes?"" How original. Another marketing tool.",0,0
R2AV7FR8D1RQCO,"******WARNING, SPOILERS AHEAD******I loved the first book (gave it a 5-star review) and couldn't wait for this follow up. I read it in a day and while I'm happy to have some questions answered after reading the epilogue to Everything We Keep, I'm a bit disappointed with the direction of things in Everything We Left Behind.While I'm aware this book is James's/ Carlos's story, I just feel there was way too little of Aimee. With everything going on in her journey - and so much emotion involved, I felt I didn't get enough closure from her perspective here. I was also hoping to see more of the family dynamics that led to the entire mess from EWK.Instead of all of that, the prominent figure in this book (along with James/ Carlos) was Natalya, who quite frankly annoyed me. I really had no interest in how much Carlos lusted after her, so soon after the loss of the wife he supposedly fell hard for, and yet, it was the main theme of the book. Natalya's hair, body and how badly he wanted to screw her and persuade James to feel the same way about her through the journaling. And somehow, she was just as much in love with the version of the man she only experienced for 24 hours as she was with the man she loved for 6+ years - even though they're two completely different people, even if they both had the same heart/ soul.It just wasn't what I was hoping for.The one good thing, though, was at least they took Phil's assault on Aimee a lot more seriously from EWK. It seemed this violation was shoved under the rug in the first book, so I'm at least happy the regrets and remorse happened here.I would have loved this book if:1 - There was more focus on healing the past and James/ Aimee having more interaction (I mean, that was what I was hoping for when I read the epilogue in EWK).2 - Far less Natalya (or none of her at all).I really wanted to love this as much as I did EWK. I'll still read the third one when it comes out and hope it ties up some loose ends between the two lost loves in a way that makes this journey worth it.",0,0
R35HKPK37NACLX,"Like a typewriter stuck on one letter, this book is full of similes.  As repetitive as a woodpecker working on an old oaken log, this book is full of similes.  If you enjoy similes like a dog enjoys scratching his fleas, then you may find this book entertaining.Like a freshman English professor tired of reading excessive adjectives in assignments, I did not.I too stuck it through to the very end, wading through the tedious and verbose prose; probably more because I'm stubborn (and always finish my books) and not due to the fact that I was enjoying the read.The storyline, though sometimes confusing, was above average.  It almost begs a sequel.  But, like an imperfect movie that gets mediocre reviews, this book needs no continuation.As a fairly frequent reader, I've got one last question:How did this make Oprah's book club?!!!",0,0

R1KHD0IPSOBJNQ,"While I'm a fan of Star Wars, this one left me cold. Neither my kids or I made it to the end; it's just boring - while it manages to introduce characters we know and love, it just doesn't feel like a Star Wars film.

Just read any of the numerous 1-star reviews for the gory details.  I won't repeat them here.However, I can recommend TWO much much better movies that also follow multiple story lines and are based around car crashes.  Amores Perros or 21 Grams.  You might not need to see both of them, but either one would certainly be worth checking out.  Those movies have depth and emotion and REAL characters in them.

R19ZW3XMVIFU7P,"Note: Review updated below on 4/8/18.I read this new book, tried the diet and did not have the succress Haylie Pomeroy touts with this plan.  My mother was a gourmet cook, so I was raised on real food. She didn't allow things like soda, marshmallow fluff or pop tarts in the house. She also thought cold cuts were bad nutrition and cooked her own roasts for sandwiches, which she also thought were poor nutrition anyway. So, I never lived on junk food as a way of life. My problem: Taking a job that required sitting all day for the first time in my life ... and gaining 75 lbs. over 16 years, despite exercise and eating well. And I probably not only gained weight, but changed my metabolism. So, when Haylie's book came out, I decided to try her eating plan.First, eating 6 oz of protein at a meal was more than I could handle and made me nauseous. Fish was easier to handle in that amount, but with today's seafood costing $10-18 per pound, that wasn't going to happen often.Second, all of the carbs and fruit during  Phase 1 on days 1 and 2 threw my blood sugar into the stratosphere. Don't any of her clients have this problem? Oh, right. Haylie Pomeroy is not a physician.Third, I lost 25 pounds during month one and lost no more weight after that, even when I followed the diet for 6 more months and exercised per the plan. What gives? My doctor thought it was too much food for me and too many carbs in Phase 1.But there is another, important reason why I wrote this review ... for patients on blood thinners. Ms. Pomroy claims, ""The Fast Metabolism lifestyle is the way we SHOULD be eating all the time, not just for the 28-day course of the diet! ...There's plenty of flexibility for working around food allergies or sensitivities, and any other restrictions imposed by medical conditions.""  I have friends taking Coumadin or Warfarin. This eating plan does not provide enough modifications for the strict dietary regime of people taking blood thinners unless you follow Phase 3 for 7 days. Anything with Vit K has to be severely limited, which are the mainstays of this eating plan: greens, lettuce and vegetables, many herbs, several fruits, some proteins (beef liver, tuna), tomato products - sauces, salsa, juice, etc. A friend who wanted to follow FMD cannot.The author also suggests drinking half your weight -- in ounces -- of water each day. So, if you weigh 220 lbs., you are supposed to drink 110 ounces of water. Well, not according to my Urologist, who recommended 64-80 oz.a day.Packaged Products Sold on Haylie Pomroy's Web Site: I reviewed the ingredients in the FMD ""packaged"" products from the pills and powders to the bars; my friend cannot eat any of them after checking with his physician because of what they contain (pea protein powder, soy, tocopherals, turmeric, inositol, etc.)  So, if you are taking Coumadin, you will not be able to eat the pre-made products except the Phase 3 protein bars. I think it's better to lose weight using real food.  The author will make a fortune on her packaged goods. Her Bars cost $42.00/box ($3.50 each); 14 servings of Phase 1 Pure Food Powder costs $54.00 + priority shipping method. You could buy a lot of fish for that money. I can buy Optimum Nutrition Organic Whey Powder (best tasting protein powder after BSN Syntha-6) in the 30 serving size for $25.99 and get free shipping. The FMD powder may have a few more grams of protein and carbohydrates, but I can't justify spending $67 on a tub of powdered food replacement. I'd rather eat chicken.All in all, I gave this eating plan two tries, lost the same amount of weight both times (which was a lot less than what I wanted to lose), stalled with no weight loss at the same point each time, and moved on. If a vegetable lover cannot lose weight on this diet, I have no clue what the answer is. All I know is that people should check with their PCP if they want to follow this eating plan because Ms. Pomroy is not an M.D.4/06/18 Update:  I have been meaning to update this review for years and finally got around to it. After reading other books about weight loss, cortisol, insulin resistance, diabetes and obesity, there were several authors I connected with:  Dr. Robert Lustig, Dr. Joseph Mercola, Dr. Jason Fung. The one that was the best for me was Dr. Fung, who wrote The Obesity Code  The Obesity Code: Unlocking the Secrets of Weight Loss  (his newest book is The Diabetes Code  The Diabetes Code: Prevent and Reverse Type 2 Diabetes Naturally ). I learned that meat is converted to amino acids, but when it's eaten in excess it is stored as white AND brown fat. Lightbulb!  Why didn't any other author ever mention this in a ""diet"" book before? Always thought excess protein was digested into amino acids which ""hung out"" until they were needed!  Now I know why I had elevated blood glucose which I never had before and why I was insulin resistant and borderline Type 2 Diabetic after following The Fast Metabolism Diet: too much protein, too much starch, too much fruit, eating too often (i.e., snacks between meals). Dr. Lustig was right in his nutrition class The Bitter Truth: Sugar or products that break down into sugar are toxic!  So the Whole Foods apple with natural peanut butter that I ate 3 hours after lunch wasn't so healthy after all. Thank you to all those doctors who told me to eat 5-6 small meals each day. It didn't work. Grrr.Admittedly, conventional thinking about food and the food pyramid have gone through several changes since the 50s. When we used to eat three squares a day with no snacks in the 60s, we gravitated to a low fat diet in the 70s and grew wary of saturated fat in red meats due to heart attack risk, and moved on in the 90s to 5 or 6 ""feedings"" per day including meals, snacks, protein bars and smoothies, which was diastrous for me. It's time for the USDA to replace the old Food Pyramid calling for 6-11 servings of grains and starch per day for one that focuses on vegetables, protein, healthy fats, fiber and whole grains with notes about sleep and fasting.Through using a LCHF eating plan and ensuring I maintain a 12 hour ""fast"" between dinner and breakfast if not a few longer fasts, I have passed the 25 pound mark and am on my way to lose the rest, and it's only taken 10 years for me to find the right solution to correct insulin resistance and eliminate high blood sugar. Thank you Dr. Jung. Oh, I donated Haylie Pomroy's book to Goodwill because I am sure someone has to lose only 25 pounds. And I also asked my friends to remind me of what I always said before reading The Fast Metabolism Diet, ""How useful can a diet be when the book is written by a someone who's not a doctor?""",0,0
RCNM5641JKVK9,"Review Disclaimer:  This review is for the Theatrical release of this movie; I have not viewed the DVD.I have to tell you, this was the worst movie I have ever seen, second only after maybe, Criminal Law, with Gary Oldman, and Kevin Bacon.  Okay, this one was worse, now that I think about it.I saw this one in the theaters about 17 or 18 years ago.  I think I remember sneaking into it, or going in quite unwilling, but it was the only movie starting at the time I was there.I began watching, and it seemed like it was a few minutes into the movie, and no advertisements ran.  I watched, as some characters came onto the screen, and weird gibberish came out of the speakers.  I had heard it was a really strange movie, so this didn't put me off, ...yet.  But then I started seeing weird things, like smoke suddenly appearing, than being sucked up, and people walking sideways, and backwards.  Well, I think you're beginning to catch on.  The film was running backwards, or something.  I'm still not sure.  So, what's the big deal, you ask?  Read on.HERE'S THE KICKER!!!!  There were about 20 people in the audience, and nobody, not one person realized what the problem was, until about 3 - 5 minutes into the film!  I'm not kidding!  It was the most bizarre theater experience I've ever had!  Finally I stood up, just as one or two other folks were standing up to go complain.Well, I didn't return to the movie.  It was like some kind of sign, telling me to leave the movie theater.  I think I asked to go see another film instead, and never looked back.This is a true story.  I'm not kidding!  This happened in the area of South San Francisco, in the Bay Area, San Francisco, sometime around 1987 or 1988.MC White said:  Backwards smoke and gibberish is a message from above; leave the theater!",0,0
R1QWPCENT4UTH2,"This is a great album i must have heard some of this stuff when i was a kid but i never knew who played it till recently. This album has great classics like running with the devil and i really got you. The only fault i can pick in this album is that i feel some parts of eruption is over worked but once it gets into the general tune its a great song.And Avril_Lavigne#1fan i noticed that your always saying in the linkin park meteora CD reviews to stop the hating but i think your a hypacrite because u come in here and bad mouth Van Halen and Led Zeppelin Around here it goes u give a little u get a little You show us respect we will show u respect even if the music u listen to is created by half wits. u have a twisted idea of who are guitar legends if were talking about people that can barely play a guitar and hav riffs that a 3 year old could master then damn blink, good charlotte, linkin park and lets not forget avril lavigne take the cake. but if we are talking about the legends of the guitar world then i thinf those bands dont come close. I also noticed that u right reviews on Van Halen and Led Zep without evan listening to the songs on the album and judging it on its MTV air time. I'm sorry to break this to you but MTV sucks. All they do is play all the stuff like r n b, rap, pop, hip hop, nu metal (a plague on the metal name) and wat they call punk rock which it isnt punk is the sex pistols, the ramones and similar. PUNK IS DEAD!!! I think it u should stop posting reviews with real meaning except to bad mouth great bands and to give ur bands obvious 5 stars because u look at it with a one eyed approach",0,0
R39E159FJCDA7Y,"Let me tell you the story of the actual physical copy of this book I borrowed from my stepmom, as it is actually quite a metaphor for how I feel about the content inside.  I was bored one day so I asked my stepmom if she had any good books I could read (this, perhaps, was my first mistake).  ""Me Talk Pretty One Day"" was one of the several books she offered.  From the reviews on the cover, Me Talk Pretty One Day seemed ""wildly entertaining"" and funny.  I brought the book to work to read on my downtime, but wound up (before I had a chance to start it) lending it to a coworker who needed it more than I did.  (My coworker had even more downtime.)  She got about fifty pages in, thought it was alright, but opted at that point to play Slingo on her phone.  She put Me Talk Pretty One Day in her purse where, later on, a bottle of water mysteriously opened up and poured onto the book, soaking it through.  Other more important and expensive items were in her purse and got ruined but she felt particularly bad about this book because it was not hers.  She thought it was mine.  She said she was sorry; told me she would replace it, but I told her not to worry, the book was actually not even mine but rather my stepmom's and I didn't really care.I'm sure this only made her feel worse.I told her we would see how the book dried, then determine whether or not a new copy was needed.  It dried in time with the aid of a space heater and, as it turned out, only the pages were slightly wrinkled and warped.  The text was okay so I figured the book was okay and my coworker needn't worry about replacing it.  It was at this point that I resumed possession and began to read it.  I too thought the book was alright- moderately entertaining and humorous- but ultimately pointless.  By the time I got to disliking it, my reason being the book is what I titled this review, I felt I had invested too much time to just stop and not complete the book.  So I kept reading, hoped the next story/essay would be better than the last (they weren't), until the end.When I finished, I brought the book outside, placed it into a used aluminum cooking tray, and lit it on fire.  The pages were too badly water-damaged to return to my stepmom anyway.",0,0

R2RO1HPZNU3X4F,"I know I'm going to get mass bad votes on my review, but I wanted to put in my 2 cents.As far as the movie goes, the visuals and acting were pretty good.  Portman was believable in her emotion, and Weaving was great at portraying emotion even with his face concealed by a mask.  But for me, that's where it ends.I do not understand the opinion of who say this movie is 'thought-provoking' or 'deep' in any sense.  It has been pointed out in previous reviews, that right-wingers are the only ones finding any thing wrong with this movie, because it offends their political views.  Now, I'm not a conservative, but could it also be said that left-wing people find it enjoyable because it somehow supports their beliefs?First of all, the 'hero' wears the mask of a religious extremist himself.  How ironic is that?  A brief history lesson of Guy Fawkes will tell you that he tried to blow up the House of Lords not to gain 'freedom' for the masses, but because Fawkes was a Catholic and James I was a Protestant.So V tries to free everyone through violence, and in the end, he leaves everyone else to clean up the mess and fill the power vacuum that is left behind.  Just like a terrorist.  Create mayhem and destruction for thier own views, and leave the rest of us to pick up the pieces and move on.  This movie was juvenile in its themes and ideas, most notably that the UK would ever be ruled by a Christian regime.  I'll only say that if you want to see a good movie about authoritarian rule without all the blatant political propaganda, go rent Equilibrium.  That's a 4-5 star movie.",0,0

R1GX1GHSI1OQW0,"There was one reason and one reason only I ever selected this book--it is the book for the Common Reading Initiative at my alma mater, Mississippi University for Women, and I was curious about it.  The reason I say that is because I didn't like the book but I'm perfectly willing to admit that my love of happy endings and pleasant plots (you don't see me reviewing any horror  here, or murder mysteries or too many other books that are filled with death, blood or gore) may be the reason.Two words that come to mind when describing the book are ""wet"" and ""gray"".  It rained all the time, a heavy driving rain, and then wind blew.  There was no let up.  There had been no let up for weeks, as noted above.  Many of the characters smoke, and smoke frequently, adding to the gray aura.  While there are a few bad guys in the book, most of the people are gray--they do bad things but aren't evil people; deep down, they are just trying to survive.I will say that the writing is well-done.  The language itself paints pictures as vivid as photographs.  Michael Farris Smith is clearly a gifted writer; I just don't happen to like this story.  I like sunshine and happy endings and this book had neither.I'd like to thank the publisher for making a review copy available on NetGalley.

R3HWX51J66QLZ3,I consider myself a feather pillow expert. I've been sleeping on feather pillows for probably 44 years. I have a feather pillow from the same company that is so comfortable and I love it! I bought these two pillows and hopes that it would match the pillow that I own. The two pillows that I bought our way to puffy with air not feathers. The pillows fluff up very large and very impressive looking. But when you lay on them they don't give they don't break down they stay puffy. You have to push the air out of the pillow to get them to go down when they go down they literally go flat with no support whatsoever and no play. I hate these pillows except for the fact they do make good pillow stuffers for your decorative pillows that you don't sleep on. If you're planning on sleeping with these good luck they are not comfortable. Feathers do not poke out of them but they are extremely hard and puffy or flat and firm and lifeless. I hate that I had to give these a bad review and I hate that I am stuck with these stupid pillows.,0,0

RKY9MBH3FWVWF,"Up until this point I had looked at IMAX as being the goldstandard for what 3D content should achieve -- that is, untilI had the opportunity to spend some time with Wild Ocean.This is actually my second attempt to review this title.Truth be, about 8 minutes into watching this documentaryI turned off the television and threw my notes in the garbage.There were better things to do with my time, I thought.Over the past day, however, I have been slowly postingin threads warning people not to buy this title and I felt thatif I was going to make such warnings that I should take thetime to explain why I feel this way.  So, into the trash canI went and with crumpled paper in hand this morning I revisitedWild Ocean in order to give it the chance it deserved.Wild Ocean brings us to eastern coast of Africa and takesus beneath the waves into the circle of life.  The problemright off the bat is that the material mostly concentrates onsardines and the predators that threaten their life whichinclude dolphins, copperhead sharks, humpback whalesand of course, MAN.It doesn't take long until you begin to tire of the material.I can't begin to recall how many times I watched schoolsof sardines and swimming dolphins.  Above the water weget some stunning coastal shots intertwined with lots offisherman and dancing natives.So, here are the major problems with Wild Ocean...First is the material.  If this were the first Imax film I hadever watched it might be passable.  However, you immediatelynotice how inferior this is to other titles.  Second problemconcerns the narration.  The narrator talks in a thick accentthat is often very difficult to comprehend.  So many times Ihad to stop, scan footage backwards, and re-listen to thecommentary in order to understand the names of fish andwildlife that were being spoken.The documentary opens with a badly produced 3D commercial,of all things, for Nokia which gives us a preachy message abouthow we can save energy.Finally, and most importantly, is the quality of the 3D.  Forthe first 8 minutes I was suffering from eye strain.  The materialhad an abundance of ghosting and was downright blurry.  Uponsecond viewing I was pleased to see that the imagery got betterthough I stand by my past comments that underwater footagetends to get blurry and out of focus -- especially when there aredebris and water bubbles that constantly divert your eyes fromthe main focal point.The amount of depth and separation is just ""okay"" after seeingother stuff that is so much better. The best 3D here usually comesin the form of the coastal flyovers.  There's a beautiful shot of awaterfall that is seemingly suspended in mid air.There really isn't any ""In Yo' Face"" 3D here.  The best you getis the beaks of bottleneck dolphins slightly protruding the screenalong with a few water bubbles.The audio is perhaps the best feature of the presentation.  It'sa highly punchy, surround-active soundtrack that continuallyenvelopes the viewer with screeching birds, music and watereffects.  At the conclusion of the documentary there is a waterbattle between the sardines and predators with lots of thunderousclapping music and effect noise that barrage the listener fromevery direction.CONCLUSIONThe biggest factors one should consider in what they purchaseis whether the content will be entertaining and whether it is well producedfor 3D viewing.  Wild Ocean is neither.  The 3D is lackluster compared tothe other exceptional IMAX titles that are available and quite frankly, it'sb-o-r-i-n-g to watch.You could do much better.",0,0
RY8MYJUSPBKR0,"I think other reviewers have highlighted the stupid, silly aspects of this story:  ridiculous storyline (especially ending), yet another (!) story about a duke, unsympathetic and fairly narrowly drawn hero and heroine, absurd secondary characters, no sense of romance, etc.  What is good about this book, however, is that no matter how unsympathetic the hero and heroine, it is interesting to see how they box themselves into a corner, then try to get back out.  For this reason, I give the book 2 stars instead of 1 --- because the story reminds us all that no one is perfect and that everyone makes mistakes and sometimes it can't be helped.  If you are desperate to read, check it out at the local library and don't waste your money.",0,0
RRMY4V2TV55F7,"For $35 bucks, I wish I would have gone with something a lot less expensive and with a lot more color choices. I thought that I could mix some colors together to get the right hue of brown-orange to paint an orange tiger stiped kitty. But instead, I have purple-brown and a very marigold yellow gold-orange. Like I said, I tried to mix the brown and orange to get a great golden brown, but there is too much red in the raw siena (#069). The umber is very red too. You'd think I'd have a nice orange on my painting somewhere but I am not happy with the results of these pencils.I also found that even though I used the side of the pencil for some shading, it still leaves pencil lines. They don't seem to blend very well at all. For $35 dollars for just 18 pencils, I made a mistake in ordering these. I read many reviews before buying and thought if I don't pruchase good quality, I won't be happy. Sadly, I'm still not happy with these pencils.",0,0

RMJYQK0CJSFMT,"I thought this would be a lightweight but diverting read down a well-traveled road. A powerful secret society that had existed for centuries and still survived in the modern world. It's been done many times but what the heck, right? It started off well with numerous elements of a classic thriller. Again, nothing new but enjoyable enough. Right off the top it started with a gruesome execution in the basement of a wealthy aristocrat's home which resulted in the murder of an uninvited witness shortly thereafter.Enter the plucky ex-commando who served with the deceased witness in the army who agrees to help the dead guy's sister find out what happened. And, oh yes, they had also been sweethearts back in the day but broke up because the guy couldn't commit.  Aww[...]It goes along well enough for a while, but then I began to notice that there were far too many highly unlikely coincidences inserted to move the plot along which started to get rather annoying. Plus decisions the main characters made seemed designed to deliberately put themselves in harm's way for the sole purpose of actually getting some drama out of it. Deus ex machina is ok in *very* small doses, but when you make it the critical element in keeping the story going you know that the storyline is in trouble.And when the evil ones slaughter an entire convent of elderly nuns in the most brutal manner possible when they could have just taken what they came for and left, I would have called the literary 911 if one existed. Even so, I tried to plod on just to see how the story resolved itself. But when I came to the part where the hero was captured, helpless and describing for us in graphic detail the damage the bad guy's chainsaw would inflict upon his chained up body, I threw the thing away in disgust. This is a slasher flick disguised as a thriller, and shame on the publisher for letting something like this get inflicted on an unsuspecting public.I see from other reviewers that it got even worse at the end so I'm very glad I quit when I did. It was just something I picked up at the library so at least I didn't spend any money on it. And I can absolutely guarantee I will never touch anything else from this author. I prefer to keep the contents of my meals where they belong and not spewed across the room, thank you very much.",0,0

So, very excited to receive 'The Pulse' in the post this morning and was looking forward to curling up with Julian on the sofa.I have read three so far.  'East Wind', 'At Phil & Joanna's 1: 60/40' and 'Gardeners' World.  I wouldn't define any of these as 'stories'.  The first and third had me reaching the end and thinking 'Oh - is that it?'  They seemed more like the opening chapters of books than stories in their own right.  The 'Phil and Joanna' 'story' reads like a transcription of inane dinner-party chatter, with a large part taken up with wittering on about smoking (is Julian an ex-smoker by any chance?). What was the point of writing this?

Stranger then fiction, Semi-Pro, and now Step Brothers are just not funny and painful to sit through. Will made me laugh on SNL and he is a very funny man. But the disappointment I continue to get from his films is never ending. Sorting through the reviews on here where people claim they laughed from beginning to end is unbelieveable. What movie were you watching? Do you think a 2x4 to your own face is funny? There is a scene or two that I could muster a giggle at but to have someone claim they saw this in the theatre 3 times and they now own it on DVD is frightening on so many levels.

R1YBR306ET9WSJ,"I bought two tubes on July 12, 2020.  The first one failed within two weeks, developing a pin-hole leak on an interior seam facing the hub.  The second failed within two days of installation, also on an interior seam, different spot.  Since the seam area is ribbed, the tubes can't be patched.  My rim (spoke protector) strip remained in the proper position and is in perfect condition.  The riding conditions and circumstances were not a cause of failure.  Tire inflation was at the lower end of the recommended range.I tried contacting the vendor following the warranty instructions included in the box.  There has been no reply.  I tried calling the manufacturers' U.S. rep and received no assistance.Since other reviewers are also complaining of leaks around the seams, I have to believe the manufacturing process is delivering highly variable results.  The fact that the manufacturer is not standing behind the product is disappointing.One other thought.  The slime tubes can ""clog"" around the Schrader valve, making it difficult to top off once the tire is initially inflated.  You need to remove the valve stem, clean off the gunk, and try again.  But note, a pinhole on a rim-facing side isn't exposed to the slime, so those holes will leak.  In other words, with slime tubes it's possible to have all the disadvantages of slime and none of the advertised benefits.UPDATE: August 28, 2020The vendor replied by e-mail while this review was being processed by Amazon, offering an exchange or refund.  I chose the refund which they indicated would take 3-6 weeks to process.  Rating changed from 1 star to 2 stars.",0,0

RTIP3IQ41LN4,"This diet made me ill on the first day.  I was absolutely starving the entire day and by afternoon I was lethargic and developed a huge headache (not from caffeine withdrawal).  Thank you to all the Amazon reviewers who posted about their negative experiences - I decided to quit after reading that many others had experienced the same thing, sometimes for the entire 28 days of the diet.According to many reviews, this diet works for some people and they were not hungry - great for them.  My conclusion is that my metabolism is already fast and for people like me who already eat healthy and exercise, this diet is dangerously low in calories (600 calories in Phase 1).  I chose to ignore reviewers who exposed the low calorie intake for the first two phases.  Two of my friends did this diet and assured me they weren't hungry so I decided to try it anyway.

At 70% through the book I promised a friend if I read one more word of this dark and gloomy book I would pay them $25.00!  This book was THAT hard to take.  Here's the thing ... I love reading about challenges and ""dark"" times if there is a tiny spark of grit, some humor, a reason to hope, words of wisdom, and surprising gold nuggets where you least expect them.  Those things keep me in love with the characters in the stories, even if the stories are tragic and the characters often make weird decisions.  You want to walk away from the last page feeling changed - empowered to face your own challenges - and think about the novel days, months, even years later.  This book just needed more editing.

R1XOJBRFNZK8WF,"After reading this book, I read reviews of The Te of Piglet and saw how horrid they were.  Then I reread this book.  I read a book like this, read it again and highlight good passages, then read it at least once again with red underlining of the truly meaningful passages.  In rereading this book, the author clearly has veered away from The Hundred Acre Wood.  I found myself very dissatisfied with the few meaningful passages that actually related to it's title and how many empty jars of poo one had to read through and around to find them.  It read this time more like he was just warming up for the bash-fest of the Te of Piglet.  If one is objective and Taoist-learning/leaning, one can't help but question the tone of many passages if the author is truly trying to point toward Tao.  Objectively speaking...Puritans are referred to as ""Miserable,"" ""hardheaded followers,"" and ""Party-Crashing BusyBody religion"" fail(ed)ures.  There rants against automobile pollution/poisons. He draws a line ""...from the Miserable Puritan came the Restless Pioneer, and from him, the Lonely Cowboy, always riding off into the sunset, looking for something down the trail""...to his ""Bisy Backson.""  The more I consider this book, the less I like it.  Though not a Puritan, I've done some personal pioneering and been a true cowboy, sometimes alone but NEVER lonely.  The author is clearly struggling with his own inner/outer issues.  By the end of the book, I found myself having to check the cover again for the title to see how what I'd just read might be related to it.  He truly could have put his few mentionable thoughts easily on the space of the dust cover.  I feel like I need to read Winnie The Pooh, proper, to restore my balance after having my memory of having it read to me in childhood now rendered cloudy.  I think if Pooh were truly present during the writing of this, as the author sometimes pretends, he would have wandered off in search of something interesting instead of waiting to see how this book turned out.",0,0

R35HTOX66EDYL8,"I thought I would change things up and go back to a good old historical fiction, a break from mysteries, my genre of choice this year.  I knew I was in for a slower pace, but this was really slow at times.  We were switching back and forth from Aurore’s childhood to her present day life (in her 30’s and on) as writer George Sand.  While interesting, I felt myself longing for a plot line. This read more like a biography from the subject’s point of view with some emotions thrown in (which may have been the intent as I’m not claiming to be mislead.)  I could easily put the book down at night (a big indicator that I wasn’t invested in what was going to happen next) and it took me way too long to finish!I’m a fighter, so I slowly fought my way through this book, but it really wasn’t my cup of tea.  Again, Aurore/George led a very interesting life, but I never really liked her.  And call me ignorant if you will, but I read historical fiction to make myself smarter, so I was surprised to learn that Amantine-Lucile-Aurore Dupin, more commonly known as George Sand, was a real person!  And in my quick Wikipedia research confirmed the other characters in the book and many events in her life were indeed true.  And at the end, the author did have an “Afterward” (which I always very much appreciate!)But back to George.  I started off very annoyed with her choices as a mother of 2 young kids.  Through flashbacks to her childhood, her behavior mimics that of her mother, but just because that was how you are raised, does not mean that is what you should do!  And then I felt like she just worked her way through lovers, fitting her kids in as she could, writing books, dressing as a man, creating all sorts of rumors and buzz, and overall led a very selfish life.  There was just nothing to latch onto, nothing to hold my interest, nothing to look forward to.If I were better versed in George Sand or even in 1800’s European arts around which this took place, I could see liking this book much better, but it just didn’t hold my interest.  I did recognize some of the famous names, like composer Chopin, but many were lost on me.  I’ve heard wonderful things about Elizabeth Berg, so I definitely wouldn’t let this one keep me from picking up one or two of her MANY others, as the writing was beautiful.  For me, my rating is based on my personal enjoyment of the novel.I’d love to hear your thoughts, but this one just fell flat for me.  I greatly appreciate the opportunity to read and review from NetGalley and Random House Publishing Group (this book was provided free in exchange for an honest review)",0,0

R2DTIPSAFYNMCZ,"I gave it a four initially.  I enjoyed it, and wanted to encourage more good story telling like this.But my second read changed my view.First, it didn't read well. I had to work my way through it.And second, the principles he advances did not hold up.Start with mavens, connectors, and salespeople.  He insists they are different types,  But look at your own experience.  Most excellent salespeople are connectors; the very traits that make them effective sales people draw people to them.  Many mavens are effective and active salespeople.  People simply are not just one but not the other.And the notion of mavens is as old as public relations, and the key element of it.  Every PR person knows them, however, as KOLs: Key Opinion Leaders.  But rather than recognize this, Gladwell suggests he has discovered the idea in the form of Mavens.  He's taken a very gold wine, put it in a new bottle, and sold it as something new.  It's KOLs, as any PR peson happily would have told him--it's the very essence of that profession.His discussion of Airwalk is maddening.  The marketers for Airwalk targettted trend setters.  The effort worked; the trendsetters did what they always do: they started a trend.  Trendsetters start trends!  We didn't know?Given his obvious awareness of cognitive biases--he's brought many of them to the attention of people who'd never heard of them--he must be aware of Bandwagon Effects.  And fashion trends are the most vivid and famous example of them.  Trendsetters start a bandwagon and other people--and people in a famously other-directed culture like ours are particularly prone--jump aboard.  Fashion trnd may be the oldest and most common illustrations of tipping points.  Gladwell never acknowledges this, either because he somehow missed it completely, or because acknowledging it would ruin his story of Airwalk.But isn't the Bandwagon Effect the Occam's Razor here?  Isn't it the simplest--and yet the most tenable--explanation for that fashion trend and every other?  Isn't Airwalk just the latest version of a very very very old story?And one more influence made me reconsider my initial review.  The ideas have had no influence--at least, none I am aware of.  Nothing has stuck, except perhaps the idea of stickiness--which has been around for centuries, albeit without the sticky label.  Every great author knows the elements: Uniqueness, concreteness, surprise, emotion.  Aesop knew it.  Shakespeare knew it.  Moses, Mohammed, and Jesus knew it.And good story teller that he is, Gladwell knows them too.  To suggest it's a new discovery.  He just suck another new wine label on it.So lots of the wine in this one didn't taste good, and the rest tasted old.  And quite honestly, he was not the storyteller I thought I remembered.  His later work is better--as storytelling.  As social science, it just seems like a terrible mess.",0,0

R2BIQWLY00P368,"Short Review: Many different technical and narrative problems combine with a slow, heavy-dialogue story to create an easy but boring read that leaves you largely apathetic about reading the next installment, and for that matter, about anything you just read.Long Review: I'm really bummed out about this.  I've read several ""Old Man's War"" stories (but lost interest after the 3rd book), and I actually gave 4 stars to ""Lock-In"", so I was expecting something a little more streamlined and compact than an ""Old Man's War"" novel, but more expansive and imaginative than ""Lock-In"".  Unfortunately, this novel is neither of those things, and suffers from both technical and narrative issues that left me ready for the story to conclude when I was still about 25% out from the ending.First, don't think of this as a sci-fi novel; it's really not.  In structure and pace, this reads more like a 19th century society novel.  Indeed, the political and social structures in this Empire, which are only loosely explored, sound more like a feudal system of some kind, with all of the Dukes and Lords and Ladies and other obscure titles. And while I recognize that Scalzi's style has consistently been dialogue-heavy with little emphasis on exposition or scene-setting, here it just does not work well.  Elsewhere, it's fine; I enjoyed ""Lock-In"" and ""Old Man's War"".  But for a story that takes place multiple thousands of years from now in a completely new setting, leading with long bits of dialogue and throwing in the occasional narration does not work and often leaves the reader wondering what to picture is happening at any moment.Speaking of which, I found it highly improbable that 2,000+ years from now, people would still be speaking modern English. There was no indication this was a sort of retro-translation for the benefit of the reader, and in fact, with the use of some very specific slang and profanity, it's clear that the characters are in-fact using modern English.  There was no real attempt to portray an evolution of language in this story, and with the use of some already outdated idioms, it really broke the idea of this being set thousands of years into the future.Ironically, I deduct points for Scalzi not doing a lot of, or even a satisfactory, amount of exposition and non-dialogue narrative, because when he DOES engage in exposition for the benefit of the reader, it tends to be long after a question of setting or an unexplained in-fiction reference occurs.  Further, the narration in this story tends to be some kind of hybrid between focused 3rd person and 1st person, in that the tense is 3rd person, but the unnecessary use of slang and profanity in non-dialogue narration tends to break the narrative lines and read like a nearly lazy attempt at story writing.  I want to be clear I'm not being insulting for the sake of being insulting; to me, it literally felt lazy, like Scalzi couldn't be bothered to cleanly separate dialogue from the background narrative.  It's one thing to do some tongue-in-cheek bit of narrative humor, it's another thing entirely to have the non-dialogue narrative full of profanity.The story itself also suffers from problems.  The nature of ""the Flow"" is never clearly explained in the novel, and after a few paragraphs that hand-wave some cliché jargon around in a way that almost literally says ""it's really complicated, no one understands it, so just go with it"", we never learn anything else about it.  Odd, considering the entire premise for this novel is built upon this one idea.  (this is to say nothing of the fact that, personally, I think the concept of the Flow is illogical, inconsistent, and impractical, and the idea that, after literally 1,000s of years, no one has figured out another way to travel is just weird)Finally, none of the characters in this novel were relatable or even more than two-dimensional.  Just about no one receives any physical description.  A few primary characters become something approximating an idea of a real person, but other than that: one of the villains is a villain in name only; another is weirdly incompetent but in such a way that they are neither evil nor confused about what they're doing; another villain is pretty much just a name and an idea with a few bit parts; another character that is of little consequence to anything but is focused upon nonetheless is just cartoonishly profane, forthcoming, and brash, if not petulant (they would have been more appropriate as a pirate, not a legitimate businessperson); and most other characters are largely just titles or ideas, but not PEOPLE.  It's weird, because I seem to recall Scalzi's other works doing a much better job of creating relatable, human characters.  Here, though, by the end of things, I really didn't care about what happened to anyone, because I really wasn't made to care.  A few high-level existential threats are not enough to make you care about INDIVIDUALS.As novels go in general, this is neither a difficult nor interesting read.  This will sound weird now, but I do enjoy Scalzi's easy-to-read dialogue-centric narrative style.  His writing in this respect is snappy, fun, witty, and entertaining.  But in my experience, that's not the kind of style that lends well to sci-fi, at least not what is supposed to a serious ""the sky is falling"" style of sci-fi.  In ""Lock-In"", it worked well.  But for a story with so many hinted new world concepts, it leaves the reader wondering when the story will start moving forward.  In this case, you're nearly done with the novel and you realize ""wait, you mean the story is all of these people just talking and yelling at each other and events happen in the background when then they're not talking and yelling?""",0,0

R5OLV2098T5PC,"My review and rating are overall for the entire trilogy, so:SPOILER ALERTThe first book, The Strain, was very interesting, in my opinion. It added this element to vampirism that is rarely seen, and this would of course be the scientific background provided. I was impressed with the extent and dedication to reality with which the authors aimed for with explaining the disease as, just that, a disease. Albeit, it's questionable at parts, but overall fairly logical. However, this logic is quickly strained as one comes to realize that a supposed natural virus is specifically weakened by any object made of silver, for whatever reason, and that it cannot cross over moving water...without the assistance of a human...Which leads one to wonder, what makes a human, one species of millions, so special that it can permit another species to cross over moving water. All in all, the first book was the most enjoyable of the three, and the most grounded in reality, but, as stated before, it quickly loses this base of reality with its supernatural tendencies and lore.The second book, The Fall, had questionable and odd actions being carried on. And one is forced to wonder: Why doesn't Eph kill his ex-wife to prevent her from locating him and his son? How is one organization able to influence the government and media so strongly so as to obscure the truth about the epidemic from being truthfully portrayed to the public? How would a man so powerful and accustomed to control be so gullible in his endeavours pertaining to the master and his true intent? How is the Master unable to obtain one book, one single tome from a known location, in a city that he controls and basically has dominion over?...and the questions go on and on. Then, of course, there is the issue with Nora being deemed the babysitter and caretaker, while all of the men go about doing the rough work and hunting. This book also continues with the waning of logic, as it is discovered that once an Ancient, or even the Master, is destroyed, every vampire created by that individual will recede with it. I understand that the Ancients and the Master have a hive mentality with their minions, but when the Queen ant or Queen bee dies, her lesser insects do not disintegrate or die along with her, and since these are supposed to be natural creatures, they should be subjected to natural laws. One final thing about this book, while the reader knows why the first book is called The Strain and knows why the third book is called Night Eternal, the reader does not know the reason for the second book's title until the ending, in which humanity experiences 'The Fall'.Finally, the third book, Night Eternal, just throws away all logic and scientific background developed previously. Somehow, after informing the reader that the vampire virus is a natural one with biologically correct possibilities, one is now left to digest that the climax of the series is religious. At this point, all credibility is thrown away and caution given to the wind. The origin of the vampire virus is not natural, it is supernatural: the seven vampires emerged from the severed body parts of a fallen archangel that was torn apart by other archangels shortly after Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed because said archangel killed one of his companions. If you value the science included in the first book, be warned, it's all given over to Judeo-Christian folklore and supernatural hoo-haa. Then, once the Master is finally defeated, all seven parts of the angel are somehow put back together and the archangel is allowed back into heaven, even though he killed a woman in Sodom and his own companion. All in all, it was a very disappointing turn of events.",0,0

R3LFCMX7HAK4IO,"Whitney Houston's Greatest Hits came out in 2000 (originally supposed to have been released in the late '90s). I bought it hoping it would have the songs of hers that I love. Some of these songs of hers are the originals that are found on Disc 1 and her previous albums, such as: You Give Good Love, Saving All My Love For You, Where Do Broken Hearts Go, and I Will Always Love You. I was really disappointed to find that some of her other songs that I love have been wrongfully remixed to where they are almost unrecognizable. These ones are: I'm Your Baby Tonight, How Will I Know, I Wanna Dance With Somebody, My Love is Your Love, and I think a couple of others (??). In my opinion, it was a crucial mistake for the manufacturers to give these latter songs the remix job. I thought those were the originals, but boy was I wrong!!! The original versions of those latter songs from Disc 2 should have been put on there as is, but not with a totally different sound to them. I was horribly disappointed about that. I have never listened to it since then, as I have made my own GH collection of Whitney's. I don't know what people have been thinking, but I don't think that this is a great album of hers (nothing personal to Whitney, don't get me wrong). This Greatest Hits title would have been an even better one if the originals of the songs from Disc 2 that I mentioned had not have been butchered up. If you want the originals of those several songs, buy the individual albums that they were on before; forget about this title!! The only thing I give credit to regarding this album is the front cover image of Whitney with a drill. WOW!!  My final note to all Whitney fans: If you have a CD burner, some blank CDs, and have these albums of hers on CD: Whitney Houston (1985), Whitney (1987), I'm Your Baby Tonight (1990), The Bodyguard Sdtrk. (1992), Waiting To Exhale Sdtrk. (1995), The Preacher's Wife Sdtrk. (1996), and My Love Is Your Love (1998), you can make your own greatest hits or boxset choosing whatever song titles of hers you like from those albums (if you want to), and put this butchered collection to shame. My grade for this album: D-. My grade for the picture: A. But, for this album my 1 star rating and D- grade for it stand as is.",0,0
R5JD2IEAJ7RSR,"One of the most complex stories in American literature fell into the hands of one of the most shallow art-poseurs ever to hit the silver screen ...it seemed like a good idea at the time. Not.  If Dune had been Lynch's own  invention, it might not be as harshly judged.  We would not be obliged to  note the miscasting, the triviaizaton in the movie of major characters in  the book, or the omission of of sequences vital to the integrity of the  story and the addition of sequences that added nothing to it. We could just  say it was another bit of late-night cult fluff from the master of the  genre.But Frank Herbert's classic deserved better. What Lynch presents here  is te Cliff Notes version of Herbert's saga, which was a deeply  philosophical and introspective journey into the soul of humankind. A  theologian as well as a novelist, Herbert pondered the difference between  the natural order of the universe and the arbitrary order of civilization.  His characters were complex and alive, and the labyrinthine plot was held  together by a clarity of thought only accessible to a philosopher of his  stature. Lynch's characters were hand puppets.The cast, wth the exception  of Lynch's onerous sidekick Kyle McLauglin, was first-rate, but they can  only use what they are given. And they seemed to have been brought along to  demonstrate their roles more than to become them. The script was hokey and  maudlin. What's more, it was delivered at a pace that gave the movie the  same feeling as the ""here are scenes from the next episode"" part  of Battlestar Galactica.The layers of patient conspiring that made the  novel so intriguing were turned into a series of Fawlty Towers skits sans  the laughs.  The stentorian Patrick Stewart was anomalous as the ugly,  folksy Gurney Halleck. Duncan Idaho was an extra. Sean Young made a good  Chani, I think, but she wasn't around long enough to tell.  Corn-fed,  Sean-Cassidy haired McLauglin made the schizoid Muad'dib look like Al Gore.  And who the hell was Sting supposed to be? He was nothing ore than a  tool,tacked on by Lynch to economize his already rambling, scatterbrained  plot. On the up side, the special effects were cool. ""Were"" being  the key word.  Now, if want to see a silly western with great FX, we can  watch the Matrix. The best effect, of course, was the Sardukar dressed in  1960s asbestos suits.I would like to see this movie done over.

R2KERWR4GYIEZW,"Now a lot of people have made some pretty harsh criticisms about the originality (or lack thereof) in Christopher Paolini's Inheritance Cycle. In this review I would like to refute some of these unfounded and unfair accusations. The main one of course being, that the series is a rip off of Star Wars.The series is about an order of ancient warriors called Dragon Riders who hold allegiance to no nation and use their martial, magical, and telepathic powers in the service of peace and justice. Now at first you may think they sound like Jedi, but they're not. You see Jedi use lightsabers, where as dragon riders just sue multi-colored indestructible swords. Totally different.About a hundred years before the start of the series an evil sorcerer named Galbatorix, not Palpatine, destroyed the riders, and established an evil empire. He did this with the help of a group of evil dragon riders called the Forsworn, the first of which was named Darth Morzan.The first book opens from the perspective of a young, sandy haired farm boy named Eragon. He is absolutely not Luke Skywalker, even though he was raised by his aunt and uncle, who are murdered by servants of the Empire shortly after he finds a mysterious object that belongs to the Empire, prompting him to flea home on a quest for vengeance.Accompanying him on this quest is Bromi-Wan Kenobi, the grouchy yet wise olf former dragon rider who gives Eragon his father's sword and teaches him just enough of the ways of the forc- I mean the ways of magic to get by, before he gets killed in the second act.After Bromi-Wan's death Eragon and his friends travel into the heart of Empire and rescue a princess named Arya, NOT Leia, that Eragon was having visions of (see, it's a VISION, not a hologram). With the princes Arya in tow, our heroes head south, to join an ALLIANCE of REBELS, called the Varden and combat the Empire's evil forces.This bring us to the second installment, where things start to get really unique and original. After an initial battle where Eragon and his companions manage to thwart the Empire, our hero travels to the homeland of the elves to meet his second teacher, who is not Yoda. UnYoda turns out to be yet another surviving dragon rider, who teaches Eragon deeper secrets of magic and telepathy, turning him into a force to be reckoned with. Unfortunately Eragon has to leave because he finds out his friends are in trouble, but before he does he promises to return to complete his training. Eventually he does return just long enough for UnYoda to reveal a secret about his family, and then die shortly later.At the climax of the book we find out something truly shocking. The Empire has managed to hatch a second dragon, a RED one, and the rider, reveals himself to be Eragon's brother, which means that Darth Morzan was his father! You see it's really nothing like the end of The Empire Strikes Back at all...Well things don't look too good for the Varden, but eventually Eragon manages to fight his way to the Emperor himself and challenge him. Unfortunately Eragon is totally outclassed by his more powerful opponent, but just when things look their worst, Darth Murtagh turns against the Emperor and saves him.Now in all seriousness, while Christopher Paolini managed to write a decent story, he did rip off many of his central plot points and characters from Star Wars, Wheel of Time, Lord of the Rings, and many others. That being said, if you can look past this, the story itself isn't that bad. My biggest problem with it is the utter lack of originality, and not just with the blatant plagiarism. The story adheres to almost every cliche and fantasy trope in the book. For young reader's it's okay, for more serious readers who want actual intellectual stimulation, I would suggest Wheel of Time, A Song of Ice and Fire, Malazan Book of the Fallen, The First Law Trilogy, etc.",0,0
R3Q7I0JO6LUNIR,"I don't usually write reviews but am taking the time to write this one.  The movie was HORRIBLY violent.  My 5 year old has worshiped Lightning Mcqueen from the moment he saw Cars.  It is NOT an exaggeration to say we have more Mcqueen stuff than Target and Walmart combined.  My 10 year old son saw the first one in the theater and passed his stuff onto my 5 year old.  Needless to say the whole family has been waiting excitedly for this movie for over a year.Within the first 15 minutes my 5 year old (not usually a cry baby) was crying because cars were dying.  One of his favorite new characters Rod Redline was tortured and then killed.  I tried to say they just blew his engine but my son was not to be fooled and was crying because that was his heart and he couldn't live without a heart!  TOO smart.  We had to leave once the threat of death was imposed on his hero Mcqueen.  The stress of his hero possibly dying made him start to shake.  My older son who thought the action was cool was also horrified at the violence and stated ""Is this really a G movie mom!"".  When we got home I had to remove the Cars 2 poster from my son's room as the 'bad' cars were on it and he couldn't sleep with them there.I am SO disappointed in Disney/Pixar and emailed them a letter basically mirroring this review.

R1JIFEGFXVXW5B,"""Dune: House Atreides"" is the first in a trilogy of prequels to the ""Dune"" novels of Frank Herbert.  Like sequels however, the only lesson you'll get from ""Atreides"" is to leave well enough alone.  Frank Herbert was masterful because he could conjure up a vast universe without losing sight of his characters' humanity, and he knew how to both deftly craft his surroundings, and keep the historic details of the Dune universe tantalizingly vague (the appeal of Dune's hidden history stemmed largely from Herbert's refusal to dissect).  The new trilogy ignores the qualities of the original's prose and the otherworldly seduction of its myriad plotting.For those new to the series, Dune is set in a far distant future, when man has spread across the stars.  Once enslaved by machine minds, men rose up in a religious crusade whose legacy has been the absolute prohibition against artificial computers.  Instead, vast schools enhance the human mind, turning men into living computers called Mentats.  Huge starships are guided by ""third-stage navigators"" - artificially evolved human beings who see through walls of time/space.  Though technologically advanced, humanity is ruled by an emperor through an aristocracy (the ""Landsraad"") perpetually at odds with itself.  (Individual houses endlessly plot against each other ala Machiavelli).  Outside of Landsraad, various other groups jockey for power - like the insidious Tleilaxu who are masters of forbidden technology, or the Bene Gesserit who conduct genetic engineering experiments designed to create a suber-being called the ""kwisatz haderach"".  Each party wield great power, but is checked both by each other and by their dependence on a mystical spice called ""mélange"" - a drug which stretches human lifespans, widens consciousness and, in really huge doses, turns humans into navigators.  In short, mélange underlies every aspect of this society.  Unfortunately, technology hasn't supplied a substitute for mélange, and the inhospitable planet Dune is its only source.In ""Atreides"" we meet younger versions of the noble Leto Atreides, the vile Vlad Harkonnen, the slyly murderous Fehnring and Shaddam - the future emperor. Aside from other characters also already established in Dune lore, we meet the royal family of Ix (soon to be exiled when Ix is overrun by Tleilaxu) and Leto's parents. Title aside, "" Atreides"" tells as much about the Atreides as everyone else. Actually, Shaddam, gets the lion's share of attention. With his father Elrood kept alive through mélange addiction, and showing no sign of releasing the throne, Shaddam conspires with Fenring to kill him.  Leto, not yet a duke, travels to Ix, whose rulers develop technology at the limits of the law.  Leto's strict mother (whose religious fundamentalism dates this book as none of the original novels had) distrusts the ruling Ixians.  The reigning duke is too fun-loving a guy to accord with the duchess' stern dogmatism.  Vladimir Harkonnen, already Baron when ""Atreides"" starts, has yet to become the physically repulsive ogre of the original epic.  Shaddam, already considering himself emperor, conspires to ""give"" Ix to the Tleilaxu, confident can blame it on a feud his father nursed against the Ixian rulers.  In return, the Tleilaxu will try to develop a synthetic mélange.  None of the original books' intense plotting nor their focus on their characters' perspective are in evidence here. No character possesses any depth. Fenring is a master in the art of murder, even when just giving advice, but here he's just annoying, and his plotting is seldom Macchiavellian. Neither Anderson nor Herbert develop Fenring in a way that suggests his complete reversal in the original ""Dune"".  Leto is the hero of the story, but he comes off as one of those angst-ridden characters of a Dawson's Creek spin-off.  None of the myriad subplots reflect an understanding of the Dune-universe.  The Bene gesserit never arouse suspicion, even though their plan to breed the messianic Kwisatz Haderach threatens everybody, especially the Navigators (since they possess the closest thing to absolute power in the Dune universe). Instead it's the illegal invasion of Ix that unites the characters in this book - but who cares? (the Tleilaxu turn the Ixians against their rulers for whom they do the most work and reap the least benefits.) The authors completely miss the underpinnings of the age old Atreides/Harkonnen vendetta (they take the feud as the logical product of Atreides nobility and Harkonnen villainy.  The point of a prequel is to show how things came to be the way they are, after nearly turning out differently). Another error is Leto's  father - described as a cruel blowhard in the original ""Dune"", he's now a benevolent ruler who lives for his loyal subjects whom he entertains with frequent bullfights. But above all is Shaddam's nonsensical collusion with the Tleilaxu.  At Fenring's urging, Shaddam presses the Tleilaxu to develop a synthetic version of mélange in order to both free his throne from spice mining and elevate it over the spicing guild.  What the authors fail to grasp is that success would only swap the monopoly of the navigators for that of the Tleilaxu (it would also nullify the industrial complex that mines the spice, one of the economic structures that both ensures the stability of the universe and, because the throne manages it, allows Shaddam to effectively rule.  Besides, if the Tleilaxu reneged, how would Shaddam enforce his end?)  The unblanced deal would make sense had Shaddam nursed a vendetta against the Ixians - but the grudge against Ix was Elrood's.Being part of a series, ""Atreides"" doesn't have to be open-ended (with half-finished plotlines and characters left for the next book), but it is.  Some subplots don't come together at all - like the expeditions of planetologist Liet Kynes or the story of C'tair, a loyal Ixian working against the Tleilaxu. But worst of all, the novel lacks a solid voice, a single perspective in its scenes to feel the pain, joy, fear and triumph that all the plotting must create. ""Atreides"" simply fails because, unlike the spice mélange that underlies much of the plotting, it is neither addictive nor consciousness expanding.",0,0
RJKV6M5OKTS69,"I bought the Powershot stapler December, 2012 because of the idea of the seemingly better design.  Actually went thru about 8 boxes of staples (10,000) before it jammed.  Some reviewers did not get even one clip thru without a jam.  No apparent way to unjam.  Fortunately still had my Arrow T50 staple gun that I have had 25+ years (probably >250,000 staples and never a jam) and continued my job (installing insulation).  It looked like the Powershot was an Arrow product, but have seen references to Black & Decker.  It is likely that my old Arrow was made in the USA.  Black & Decker has always impressed me as cheap junk and now that they make everything in China, cheap crap is the best description of their prducts.  I avoid B&D if at all possible, even their Dewalt line if made in China.  The Chinese know how to make cheap crap and dump it on the American market.  I would pay $30 for a quality made in the USA stapler that I can depend on instead of a $15-$20 cheap Chinese crappy stapler that we all know will crap out on us.  It is also highly probably that the staples were also made in China (Arrow brand) so that's a double whammy against quality & dependability. So buy made in the USA if at all possible.

R35H46H9EOUIDM,"Unfortunately... I have to add my lumps as well as the majority of other reviewers. The Motion picture industry continues to drive a wedge between themselves and the buyer by instituting things like this. Even digital copy rights are rediculous, due to the fact that you can only download one version to one type of device (either WMV for windows based players, or Quicktime for Apple). This Ultraviolet thing takes it one step further.In my humble opinion... When honest buyers aren't afforded the benefit of having there own personal copy to share between members of the same household, you run the risk of them just going to get it illegally. If you want pirating to stop... stop doing crap like this. The music industry seems to have gotten the point.Remember when they tried to make CDs ""unripable"" by encripting them.

This is such a highly controversial topic to begin with and Disney really felt it was appropriate to show the ""Bond"" car have liquid forced down his throat as torture??  Seriously?  Would you ever let your child watch a terrorist be tortured?  This movie is marketed for a very young audience (my son is 3 and a HUGE fan of the first movie).  On top of all the violence, there's the political message of cars consuming regular gas/fuel are ""bad"" and alternative fuel cars are ""good.""  I am all for using alternative fuel, but this subject doesn't even belong in a kid's cartoon!  If old Mickey Mouse episodes show a warning about possible offensive content then this movie should have had a warning that Disney was about to expose our children to politics and violent scenes.  I only gave it a 1 star since that's the lowest option.",0,0

R6BS9UDBWS20B,"As I was reading reviews of this book, the first thing that came into my mind were the words of Yeshua, who said ""Every plant that my heavenly Father has not planted will be pulled up by the roots. Leave them; they are blind guides. If a blind man leads a blind man, both will fall into a pit."" Matthew 15:13-14Honestly, Leonardo is the only one who has done his homework when it comes to ""church"" history.When the Eklesia, the assembly of called out ones, or the Body of Believers in Jesus, was mostly Jewish, this nonsense about Replacement Theology was nonexistent. Three centuries later, when the ""church"" became predominantly Gentile and filled with the Greek way of thinking instead of the Hebrew way of thinking, the church become anti-Semitic and this false doctrine entered. The Bible began to be allegorized for the first time (Greek, gnostic thinking), and to fit new doctrines, it became necessary for the Bible to be ""interpreted"" in order to fit (like a square peg in a round hole) these new false doctrines. The new anti-Semitic church could not believe that hated Israel could possibly inherit the Kingdom of God, so the Bible had to be ""interpreted"" in order to ""fit"" this new view.This book leaves out discussion of so many scriptures that I cannot be silent. This theory which many Christians perhaps have been taught all their lives has too many holes to be credible. Christians who try to deny the plain text meaning of prophecies yet to be fulfilled would never do this with all the many prophecies that were LITERALLY fulfilled with Jesus' first coming. In fact, we use the literal fulfillment of prophecy to argue the case for Jesus being the Messiah!!The author begins with Daniel 9. The next chapter, as well as 11 and 12, are also important. Daniel 10, ironically, deals with Michael's battle against the Prince of Persia. Who can deny this battle is going on today? Persia is Iran!!! The Prince of Greece could be Greek thought that permeates the mainstream religion called Christianity. What about Zechariah chapters 12 thru 14. I had my son, at age 10, read these chapters and paraphrase. He told me exactly what they say. He can also read Lord of the Rings and tell me the story exactly as the author intended, but he also knows the deeper good versus evil meaning. ""A child shall lead them...""  He did not need to go to seminary or learn to interpret the Bible. The scriptures mean what they say, and they say what they mean. G-d repeats things over and over in the Bible and still people ignore them. How can you twist Ezekiel chapter 36. Count the ""I wills""!!  Please wake up, Eklesia!  Listen to the Shepherd. The sheep know His voice and listen to Him. Do not be a goat who does not listen to the Shepherd. Do not be sent to the left. He said some would be deceived, even among the elect. See He told us ahead of time. The people will be judged how?  By how they have treated His brothers in the FLESH. His Jewish brothers and sisters. Jesus is a Jew who will return as a Jew, the Lion of the Tribe of Judah who will sit on the throne of David in Jerusalem forever and forever. His Kindgom will have no end. The olive tree in Romans 11 has a Jewish root. We Gentiles have been grafted in, and we HAVE become arrogant against they natural branches who are in our day being grafted back in even as the unnatural (Gentile) branches are being broken off to make room for them. There are now over 100 Messianic congregations in Israel.  Hundreds of thousands of Jewish believers worldwide. Malachi prophesied, ""See, I will send you the prophet Elijah before that great and dreadful day of the Lord comes. He will turn the hearts of the fathers (Jewish people) to the hearts of the children (church), and the hearts of the children to their fathers, or else I will come and strike the land with a curse.""  Malachi 4:5-6Those who allegorize the plain Word of God will be speechless when standing before Him, He asks them why they did not believe what His prophets revealed. Even when almost every prophet spoke of the restoration of Israel. Before Jesus was taken up to heaven, He taught his disciples over a period of 40 days about the kingdom of God, and then His disciples asked Him, ""Lord, are you at this time going to restore the kingdom to Israel?""  He said to them: ""It is not for you to know the times or dates the Father has set by his own authority.""  Acts 1:6-7  Jesus did not correct his disciples to say the kingdom would not be be restored to Israel. He obviously had been teaching them that the kingdom would be restored for them to ask this question. This agrees with Paul in Romans 11:12 ""But if their transgression means riches for the world, and their loss means riches for the Gentiles, how much greater riches will their fullness bring!""  When Israel believes, the whole world will experience revival. When Jerusalem became united under Israeli rule in 1967 for the first time in almost 2000 years, revival broke out all over the world. Many Jews became believers this year, and the number of believers have steadily increased since.What about Isaiah chapter 11?  This is talking about life on Earth, when there will be peace one day. There will be no peace until Messiah returns. One thousand years of peace on Earth with Messiah rules and reigns. What about Amos 9:11-15?  This was not fulfilled prior to May 14, 1948. What about all of the prophet Joel?  Jesus wept over unbelieving Jerusalem as He entered it, and said He would not return until they said, ""Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord."" ""Baruch Haba B'Shem Adonai"" Matthew 23:39. This agrees with Zechariah 12 - 14.Believers in Yeshua, do not forsake God's people!  If we do not know what the Bible says from cover to cover, we will be greatly deceived in these last days.All these terms we have come up with, Dispensational, Covenant Theology.... Jesus is not amused by our lofty knowledge. None of us can believe the Bible without the Holy Spirit, the very Spirit of Truth. God is looking for a people who will worship Him in Spirit and in Truth. Let the Holy Spirit guide you into truth and not ""rules for interpretation"" and systems of theology.For a most coherent discussion of the end times, read Israel, the Church, and the Last Days by Keith Intrater and Dan Juster. Just as the Jews brought God's truth into the world the first time, so Messianic Jews are restoring truth to the Gentile believers. God's Perfect Plan! Believers, pray for the peace of Jerusalem and pray Psalms 83 over Israel. If God is calling you to pray for Israel in this hour, see thewatchman.org. God bless you!",0,0

R2HL9JZHU0NRTM,"Hollywood is in love with itself - again. Just watch the behind the scenes short on this DVD. It is so important to ""feel"" like their doing something important that the stars of this film actually have convinced themselves that they are doing something important by being in this film.The story is about a bunch of idiot bigots who represent a small minority of people in Los Angeles (though the makers of this film would like you to believe that this is how YOU behave, in secret or otherwise). The script is heavy handed in more ways than can be written about here.Every character in this film displays their feelings and prejudices like a bright red name tag on their foreheads. Then they proceed to use those feelings to pound every other person in and around them into submission. See a character in the film? Guess what he's a jerk. See another character in the film? Guess what, he's a jerk too. On and on it goes. The worst part, of all this is that the jerks are supposed to be YOU. Don't belive me? Check out the positive reviews of this film and read between the lines.Nothing deep is going on here, it is just words and hurt feelings flying around. The gimmick of how these characters all ""crash"" into each other was written on the back of a matchbook cover. I'm sorry, but this is one of the most obvious films made in the last few years.Nothing is learned or gained from spending time with this film, unless you are one of the choir. Then, of course you're gonna yell Amen to this dull edged sermon.Best picture? I don't think so.

R282V40MHMEN1H,"Being the world's largest manufacturer of digital media (disk drives) made Lite-On a natural for me to get this machine when it first came out.  I got a great price but much disappointment.(1)  The manual has poor clarity, often not enough to figure out key operations.  I'm pretty tech-savvy, so the problem does not lie with me.(2)  The machine broke in less than a year, so they sent me another.(3)  The mechanical design of the machine is not user-friendly, not intuitive.  To perform my basic operations, I had to call tech support, make notes, and later refer to them on matters that could have been better engineered.(4)  Tech support was always available (24-7 I recall), and wait times were moderate.  They always had an answer.(5)  It has worked well for two years since getting the new machine to archive my camcorder digital and old analog tapes to DVD.BOTTOM LINE:  I saved a few dollars buying this unit but paid for it many times over with the added time and monetary expense of dealing with its flaws.

R1RCGPN5RTYGJS,"I remember the first time I ever heard Britney Spears.  The song was 'Baby One More Time' and I couldn't believe what I was hearing on the radio...crap (if you believe that this entire review will be negative, please read on).  But since radio was playing her songs a million times, I learned to like that song as well as many that she has released.  Her recent material is far better than her earlier, straight-from-the-studio manufactured pop hits, and I was not surprised by her timely release of a greatest hits CD.  Many people have attacked her for this, but I will not.  What I will say is that there are only 3 great songs on this album of 'greatest hits'.  Toxic is the best club song she ever produced, I'm a Slave 4 You is a close second, but when you hear 'Baby One More Time' again you understand why it was so popular.  This is Britney's crowning achievment because at the time, there was nothing out there that sounded the same. And it brazingly marked the beginning of the ""Pop Starlets"" era, as Elton John likes to call them.  As for ""My Prerogative"", we had hoped that Britney would sound less like a studio and more like herself as she got older.  This song is the worst song she ever released. It destroys the original and, quite frankly, is not very easy on the ears.  She sounds like a muzzled mule. If you are hoping to get the best of Britney, this would definitely be it, and it's worth a whole lot more than buying each album.  Maybe for the public's sake, just as her first song started the era, her greatest hits cd will end it.",0,0

R3O11WE7GXER1L,"If you want to read a fun book with a heroine who is loving loyal, caring and funny then i'm afraid this book is not for you.In Twelve Sharpe Stephanie is faithless and disloyal amd manipulative . She continues to cheat on Joe in her persuit of getting the 'Ranger Orgasm'.Her arrogant disregard for Joe's feelings as she allows Ranger to grope and fondle her are turning her character into a […]and a […] in heat.At this point I have lost all feelings for Steph and hope Joe catches her in bed with Ranger and tosses her out of his life.Its what she deserves and it will finally move this repetative and sleazy triangle into a different direction from where its been stuck book after book.Stephanie continues to manipulate Joe and their relationship and as I continually wait for her to choose its finally dawned on me that obviously she isn't going to give up the bird in the hand which is a sure thing or the sexual fling  with Ranger either .Janet has decided that a heroine with no integraty or loyalty is what will keep the readers hooked on this series and keep selling books and she is probabaly right according to the reviews posted here.Personally I find the whole business with Ranger unpalatable and cannot understand his appeal to so many readers.This is a man who cannot be bothered to spend time or love on his only daughter or form even a peripheral relationship with her .He sends money and believes that absolves him of all responsibility.. Wow .What a stella guy.I found his daughters situation heartbreaking. She was so eager for his love that his callous disregard was disgusting to read.It was mental child abuse as far as I am concerned.This is the guy that in H8 asks for sex as payment for helping Steph out .Then after using her for a one night stand leaves her with egg on her face by tossing her out and telling her to go back to Joe .He is therefore doubly underhand and unscrupulous to continue to make sexual advances on Stephanie behind Joe's back knowing she is sexually involved with Joe.The whole series has lost its appeal for me .I don't care who she has feelings for -you can't help who you love -but you can help your actions and I cannot read a series about a heroine who has no integrity .Nearly being caught by Joe while rolling around naked in bed and having oral sex with Ranger is nothing more than  a 'close  call' as far as Stephanie is concerned. Her reaction is cold ,callous and without remose . Her lack of loyalty and her cheating has put me off her and spoiled the series for me.Whether she marries Joe or not is a moot point now because her cheating has degraded and irretrievably tained the relationship and is making a laughing stock and a fool of the man she claims to love.There is no going back from the mockery she has made of her relationship.Twelve Sharpe makes for uncomfotable and unpleasant reading even for a die -hard fan.[…]Its not worth buying to read about the same old angst played out in every book and a heroine who's action are increasingly becoming selfish and […] and who is steadily losing her integrity in each book.My money is better spent on other authors who deliver the feel good factor of earliar books without demolishing well established characters.",0,0

Yet, Still i cant believe why  people say they are soo great. The vocalist sings in a voice that almost  sounds like he's joking about everything he is saying. I myself, rate songs  mostly on how they sound(afterall music IS sound) or if the lyrics are  completely amazing. well.....SOAD's lyrics definitely arent very amazing.  so then that leaves it up to the sound......and again i dont see what  people see in them! the songs lack a sense of togetherness. i mean one  minute he will be singing in a sort of whiney, whimpering voice, then next  he lets out a hardcore growl. However, i will be the first to agree that  many bands can go through this transition and make it sound amazing, but  SOAD is not one of them.  i listen to bands like Soulfly, fear factory,  KoRn, RATM, static-X and others similar to that. (if i listed my other  favorites most of you will probably never had heard of them so i dont see  any point in listing them.)

R168I24AW3J4OP,"Embattled Rebel is a big disappointment. Short on analysis and short on interpretation one can hardly credit this is written by the author of Battle Cry of Freedom and Tried By War.  At a mere 250 pages (with 50 blank, photos or battle maps) James McPherson apparently has little to say about a subject others have written volumes: Jefferson Davis' role as commander in chief of the Confederate Rebellion.Indeed, Embattled Rebel has us careening through Civil War battles and campaigns at a dizzying pace.  Imagine touring Gettysburg with a NASCAR driver and you get a sense of reading McPherson's latest effort.  Antietam--3 pages (plus 1 map and a photo of R.E. Lee), Gettysburg--4 pages (plus one map).  Sherman's Atlanta Campaign a whopping 8 pages with a single map.  It took General Sherman longer to put on the boots that marched through Georgia then it did for Jim McPherson to write about his campaign.McPherson, seems blithely unaware his colleagues have devoted entire books to single battles.  Jeff Davis' contribution to Gettysburg doesn't merit a dozen paragraphs.  If that is true, this book needn't be written.  If untrue it is badly written.  The factual information in it reads more like Jeff Davis' Wiki page than historical analysis.  Jeff Davis begins Embattled Rebel sickly, arrogant, haughty and admired. He ends it sickly, arrogant, haughty and despised.  Thanks for the update, but is that really worth $25.00?In a positively loopy introduction McPherson advises, in the spirit of ""full disclosure"" his sympathies have always been....wait for it....with the Union!  Phew.  For a moment I thought America's premier Civil War historian was going to admit to supporting secession or hankering after a slave or two.  Fifteen years into the 21st century, EVERY decent human being's sympathies are pro-Union, anti-slavery, Mr. McP.  Full disclosure seems hardly necessary, so back to the book.The introduction natters on quoting scathing indictments of Davis' character and ability by Robert Toombs, Pierre Beauregard and Linton Stephens.  McPherson is happy to report he discovered the subject of his book wasn't as bad as all that--as though this is news.  No reputable historian looks to a subject's enemies for character reference, so what precisely McPherson's point was remains a mystery.More disturbing though and perhaps the greatest flaw in Embattled Rebel is a refusal to compare Davis to Lincoln because the latter had a tremendous material advantage in winning the war. Nobody doubts such an advantage.  But by omitting comparison, McPherson refuses to consider, not whether Davis should have WON the war, but whether he should have grown, and matured and evolved, which Abraham Lincoln certainly did and Jefferson Davis certainly did not.This is a serious and hugely disappointing omission. How could any man go through the ""fiery trial"" Davis endured and come out the other side the same serenely smug and condescending stiff-neck?  How and why the Confederate President manages such an unenviable feat is never examined or considered.  At the end of the war we are left with a half-mad ideologue exhorting the population to continue to sacrifice, continue to die for a cause that everyone but he knows is lost.  How and why he deludes himself so completely is unconsidered.McPherson seems unaware that great leaders (Washington, Lincoln, Roosevelt, Regan) are required to not only make decisions, but to inspire and convince.  In the latter two categories Jefferson Davis was a miserable, divisive failure, but the author is loathe say so.  Indeed the tragedy of his life is not that he was unfit for office, but that he was seemingly the perfect man for the job.  Between resumes and reality lies a vast chasm which Jefferson Davis fell through.I was fortunate to receive a reviewer's copy of Embattled Rebel.  If I had laid out $20-$25 for this meager work I would be really, really annoyed.  Unless you're dying to make a contribution to the James McPherson retirement fund (not an unworthy cause) I would suggest your local public library.",0,0
R393NFJOYRJWCK,"I write this review so YOU delicate shopper like me, don't suffer the despair and cringe like i did (and i still do). I bought this product because of certain needs that i had in terms of sound (knowing that Sony IS one of the icons in the sound industry), and i read some reviews (even the bad ones) that stated that it sounds like a box... i'm an audiophile and i do have some certain standards (i do have a dozen of Sony in and over ear products, all of them FLAWLESS), at first it sounded INDEED like a box but retouching the equalizer it eased and slightly improved the sound (which by the way it took me like weeks to fine-tune the EQ, it was really hard, even for me that i'm a sound engineer because sometimes sounded like i wanted to and sometimes not, i believe it had it's own will!).But now OVER A YEAR LATER, it started to sound ""MORE BOXIE"" than ever! i had to refine the EQ again and for every movie or series (even music) started to sound hollow, without bass (i had to turn it down because i already starting to feel the saturation, even en in normal volume because i use it to mood the room and watch the news), without the richness of bass, middle-bass and middle-high, which what you always look for when you buy a soundbar like this. Yes, i'm fully aware that ""i can't ask too much for that amount of cash"", but, it's money and the money costs by itself (to earn it, to save it and to manage it).Yes it is a space-saver, but another issue is the remote (you can also use an LG G3 or G4, didn't test with samsung phones), if you are pointing somewhere else that isn't a straight line (or a straight view from the remote to the soundbar) you won't be able to control it. The remote is too underpowered to send commands like a regular tv (no line of view needed), ALSO if you are like me that have everything in black (furniture, tv stands, other remotes, etc.) you'll easily loose it (that's where my phone comes in and it's a life saver!).I truly apologize for the mess in the review but i'm speaking with my mind right now and i'm going to focus again on the sound, WOW SONY, YOU SERIOUSLY MADE A MISTAKE HERE!... IT IS: sturdy, well constructed, and made-to-last, also 110/220v for those who live in other countries and it does include a toslink (fiber optic) audio and an rca standard, but... it isn't enough, the fact that it may include everything you need to plugin your favorite gadget/appliance IT DOES NOT WORTH THE MONEY.... and i regret the purchase with the bottom of my heart, i'm stuck with it, no one wants it (yeah, i tried to sell it but once they heard how it sounds they said ""no thank you"").If you, dear reader are looking for a soundbar that it does not sound like box LOOK ELSEWHERE and avoid at all cost this one!

Hamfisted representations of economic theory that would appeal to graduates of (Glenn) Beck University are brought out as reasons why the US economy is built on a dream.

Don't worry though . . . it gets worse.I don't normally write reviews, but I feel compelled to in this case, so here it goes.First off, I loved the books and David Lynch's interpretation in the theatrical release.That being said, this is just aweful.  I totally agree with those who have stated that this is an abomination.  Cons include, but are not limited to:Good scenes cut from the theatricalBad voice over with storyboards for much of the 'extra footage'Uneven quality and clumsy transitions to new materialThe list goes on.Do yourself a favor and don't spend the money on this.  Just get the theatrical release and be happy.  If you didn't like David Lynch's interpretation, then just take the time and pleasure to read the book again.I can't believe they actually released this.  I totally understand David Lynch taking his name off of this.-Sincerely,-J",0,0

R11WKYZD81Q0K4,"I was fooled into thinking this would be a light fun read by the bright color and somewhat whimsical artwork on the cover but as soon as this book began I worried that it was instead going to be about uncomfortable relationships between a few mostly unlikeable characters. I have encountered so many unlikeable characters in books recently and I was right to worry. The main character begins in a minor unlikeable fashion but by the end she was absolutely insufferable. What a mess she made of things. I kept reading because despite not liking the characters the writing was pretty good. Except that is for the description of the supposed setting. The book is set in Dublin but there was little in the description to indicate anything particularly Irish, it really could have been set anywhere.Ugh An unenthusiastic 2.5 Stars and I’m glad it’s over.",0,0

R3NE85L4T5J22J,"I bought this Oct 3, 2018. It has a 'lifetime guarantee', clearly marked on the product description.My first impression of the hose was.... what is that SMELL? It smelled extremely strongly of chemicals, and I'm very familiar with chemical smells and expect it from a plastic/rubber product until it degasses, but this was POTENT and scented the water itself. You could smell it from 30' away, and I do not exaggerate here. I figure the smell would go away eventually, and I waited to review because I didn't want to be unfair. A month later.. It never completely went away, but did lessen a bit,About 2 weeks ago, it sprang a leak at the neck.This is irreparable. The neck is BELOW the screw in head for the hose, and there's no way to reach it to seal with a washer. It's not spraying in only 1 direction, it's spraying in multiple directions, and I risked my phone getting damaged to get the photo you see, because it was spraying into my phone as I took the photo. It sprays on your clothes, your pants, your arms, and into your face as you attempt to use the hose with any type of head.I am attaching a photo of what it does so you can see it. There is no way to stop this leaking, because it is BELOW the termination of the hose threading. The amount of water being spewed is enormous. It flooded my entire 30' long porch in a matter of a minute, just leaving it on the ground at incredibly low water pressure, with the spigot handle turned 1/10 open.So I went to contact the Seller a week ago because I have a problem. It's got a LIFETIME warranty, clearly stated in the description right? There's no contact! I have contacted Sellers before on Amazon, it's a convoluted process, but it's doable. If I have a problem, my first assumption isn't that the product is defective, but that a bad one slipped through the cracks, and the Seller should be notified and given a chance to remedy. If I were a Seller, I'd want people to contact me with a problem before posting a negative review, because the item could be a one-off problem that other customers don't experience.  Well, clearly this Seller doesn't, there is no possible way to contact THIS seller on Amazon. I put it off until I had time to deal with it, and now I'm 5 days past my return period.I paid $53.24 for this hose with Amazon Prime (this includes tax). It lasted 2 weeks of dangerous smelling toxic water before proceeding to leak to the point of unusable. It has a 'lifetime warranty', with no possible way to contact the seller.You can check my reviews, it is extremely rare that I post a negative review because I always give the Seller the benefit of the doubt. Sometimes, when I can't say anything nice, I don't say anything at all, because the product neither impressed me nor was I disappointed. THIS is terrible. I mean really terrible. It hasn't lasted as long as one of those floppy shrinkable hoses.It gets 2 stars, because it IS 100' long, something that those stretchy hoses usually are not. It also has not yet kinked on me. I'd be thrilled with it, but the incredibly potent chemical smell and then, being forced to take a muddy shower outdoors every time I water my plants offsets any and all benefits.DID I get a faulty hose, or is this what has happened to everyone who bought this? Since I can't contact the Seller, I have no idea.  Please tell me how your 'lifetime warranty' works if there's no possible way to fulfill it. No info, no address, no phone number, no email, and no way to contact through Amazon.I got to water plants with a putrid smelling chemical brew for 2 weeks, got drenched in muddy chemical water for an additional 2 weeks, before tossing this in the rubbish. I am not a happy customer, CONTACT ME please if you can send me a hose that actually WORKS for my $53.",0,0

R28BXBVKAGYGYC,"As a writer, I really want to like things I read, especially books I am supposed to review. However, I have to be honest and say that I was very disappointed in this book.I believe that a lot of people (myself included!) are suffering from sugar addiction these days I was very excited to get this book for review, and read the author's story about quitting sugar, and follow her 8 week detox program.However, as I began reading, I realized that she makes ALL sugar the enemy, including natural sugars. She speaks of how she was a ""healthy"" eater and that's why she didn't realize at first that she was eating too much sugar. She was eating natural sugars, and sugars from fruits, etc. (fruit, dried fruit, and a teaspoon or 2 of honey was the extent of her sugar in a day's time, according to her) Her no sugar diet eliminates ALL sugars, including completely natural, unprocessed sugars, and fruit. I can't get on board with making fruit the enemy during the program and advocating brown rice syrup and/or processed stevia instead.Which brings me to my next point, her recipes include alternative sweeteners. Although she does speak against artificial sweeteners, she condones the use of some other alternative sweeteners, which are supposedly ""natural,"" but there is still a lot of controversy surrounding them. I was not looking to replace sweeteners with controversial alternatives, especially while cutting out completely natural fruits! I was expecting this book to be something different than what it ended up being. Several of her recipes called for brown rice syrup and processed stevia, which is quite controversial as a sweetener, and not as unprocessed as alternatives like raw honey, which she speaks against.Furthermore, there wasn't really an ""8 week detox program"" There were some thoughts and suggestions broken into 8 sections, but it wasn't really a practical, program to be followed.*I received a review copy of this book.

R3N1X73HS8682B,"This 1973 Spelling-Goldberg ABC TV movie has garnered a cult following over the years since it features two future CHARLIE’S ANGELS among the cast. While Kate Jackson has one of the larger roles here it doesn’t show off her talents in the best light and Cheryl Ladd’s performance is not indicative of the star quality she would exude as Kris Munroe just four years later.Pamela Franklin has the meatiest part, but the script is rather weak and the execution flat, like most TV-movies of the era. You WILL giggle when you see the part where the Housemother (Jo Van Fleet) is hypnotized into regressing into a chatty, paranoid schoolgirl near the end.The print is badly scratched, burned and faded and the night scenes are especially terrible in the video quality.The only other Spelling TV movie I remember seeing was DEATH AT LOVE HOUSE also starring Kate Jackson and while it wasn’t that great either, I would recommend it first over this one.",0,0

R2M7TIJ7JLPFKF,"By common agreement this seems to be a 1 star/5 star album, but I'm going to break the pattern and give it 2 stars, because in over 20 years of occasional attempts at 'cracking' this album, I have developed an odd fondess for 2 or 3 tracks. I have not given up - but after each attempt I'm forced to listen to 'nice' music for at least a few years to give my ears a chance to recover before I launch the next assault. In 20 years I haven't ever managed to listen to it all in one go, and so that is the first milestone that I have set for myself.Legend says these guys spent over a year rehearsing these songs, and that they were precisely arranged. But let's be honest - if any of the musicians had made a mistake, who the heck would notice it? On an album where it sounds like everyone is playing notes out of key, all the time? In fact, to play a bum note on this album is to play something melodic or musically attractive, which is what they successfully avoid doing for 80 minutes.As I said, I haven't given up, and in fact I take it as a lifelong challenge to one day develop a liking for this stuff. After all, for a fan of all things psychedelic and progressive, this album is like Everest, and I can't help thinking that those who like boasting that for them this is the greatest piece of music ever composed are like mountain climbers boasting about their first Everest ascent.There are those who listen to Lou Reed's 80 minutes of madness on Metal Machine Music and hear symphonies, while others insist he left his instruments feeding back against the amplifiers and went off to the bar. Lennon and Ono fans rave about their albums Two Virgins and The Wedding Album as challenging works of Avant Garde art, while others label them pretentious trash. What Beefheart has left to posterity is another musical offering, although far more complex, that I'm sure will polarize music lovers in the same way for years to come.(In 2008, it was revealed that the CIA had been using 'music torture' on suspected terrorists by playing them songs in their cells by Eminem, the Bee Gees, Dope, Christine Aguilera, David Grey and others for up to 20 days non-stop. Apparently though, it was decided that it would be 'too cruel and inhumane' to use Beefheart on them. 'We didn't want to run the risk of them suffering collateral brain damage', a CIA source stated. 'We tried Trout Mask on Muhammed ali Raqshanbani, but when he requested to be waterboarded instead after just 45 minutes, we pulled Beefheart from the program'. He added though that the CIA were 'still considering using Trout Mask Replica as a last resort in isolated cases' where waterboarding and electric shock torture had proved to be ineffective.)",0,0

R12B2J0WW63U14,"Like many other reviewers I enjoyed the first book of this series immensely. The magic system was unique and hinted at a much deeper potential. The second book was also enjoyable due to the fulfillment of many of the hinted at promises of deeper magic/warding. I too grew a bit tired of all the flashbacks in the second book. The third book bordered on unreadable. The constant jump of POVs, sometimes mid-chapter, made it all but impossible to follow this story. A poorly executed device to count the days before the waning of the moon helped little in keeping timelines flowing in a coherent fashion especially since it was intermingled with Inevera flashbacks. I found it odd that many flashbacks were to cover plot points that were already covered in previous books or chapters we had just read. Do I really need to know what five different characters were thinking during an encounter? Seems like just flat out poor storytelling. While it was obvious that Ahmann's wife would play a critical role in his life it would have played out MUCH better if he would have kept her involvement in the present and through the eyes of Ahmann. I honestly found myself saying WHO CARES when presented with page after page of her brother, father and mother not to mention way too many chapters on her training as a girl. Honestly, I might not even bother with books four and five....and that is saying a lot since I somehow slogged through garbage like the twilight series and the Hunger Games trilogy.",0,0

R2YURF7EJGN6FP,"WANTED stars James McAvoy (I guess Shia Lebouf wasn't available?) as Wesley, a down on his luck guy who works at a dead end job, has a girlfriend that cheats on him, and has no money to his name. Just when he's reached the end of his rope, he's recruited by a mysterious woman named Fox (Angelina Jolie) to join an elite group of assassins called ""The Fraternity"". It's revealed that Wesley's estranged father was a member of The Fraternity and one of the top assassins who, ironically, was killed by a rogue Fraternity member who left the group. Under the guidance of Fox, Fraternity leader Sloan (Morgan Freeman), and a few other characters, Wesley undergoes intense and brutal training in order to harness the inherited assassin-like characteristics that were genetically passed on to him by his father. The ultimate goal: to find the man who killed his father and avenge his death.The premise sounds really cool, but when I first saw the trailer for this movie it automatically had two BIG strikes against it. One being Angelina Jolie who I absolutely can't stand and the other being the shots of bullets moving in slow motion and apparently curving around objects to hit a target that's hidden in the background. Personally, slow motion bullets annoy the hell out of me. I know, it's weird and I really can't explain it. Maybe because of the fact of how RIDICULOUS it looks! How about slow motion brains coming out of someone's skull AFTER the bullet hits it? Now that would be cool. So anyway, with the two strikes against it back when it was in theaters, that meant only one thing... wait 'til the DVD comes out. Which I did. And after finally watching it, hoping to be proved wrong about my assumptions about how bad the movies is, I can say that it is as bad, if not WORSE than I thought.Basically WANTED is a one and a half star movie (MAYBE even two) that's saved by two things: Morgan Freeman and great special effects. Other than that, the film is poorly written and it's amazing how a screenplay like this can even be considered by a major studio and given the budget that this film has. The action scenes and shootouts are ridiculous and seem like they were dreamed up by someone with the mentality (or imagination) of a five year old boy (for example, a shootout in which both of the gunmen are such expert shots that every time they open fire at each other, their respective bullets crash into one another). And trust me... I love dumb Action movies with over the top violence... but this one was just horrible. It seems like half the movie is in slow motion for absolutely no reason other than to look cool or something. The best way that I can explain it is by asking a question. Have you ever watched a movie that's so dumb, that you actually felt insulted or even offended by even watching it because of the level of stupidity? Well, WANTED is that movie for me.As far as good things, the special effects were great. The effects showcased a lot of unbelievably stupid scenes but the actual effects were executed very well. Even amidst the stupidity, I actually did find a couple of moments that I liked in the film. My favorite scene is where Wesley shoots a guy in the head, sticks his gun through the hole in the guy's head and runs around with his corpse as a shield and basically shooting his firearm while it's shoved completely through the guys skull. Also the climax of the film is almost like a video game where Wesley appears to be going through different levels and taking on a miniboss of sorts until finally reaching the person (or people) that he REALLY wants to kill. There's also a twist toward the end that I didn't see coming. I won't say what it is, but let's just say that its a total ripoff of EMPIRE STRIKES BACK. And the fact that Morgan Freeman was in the movie made it a tad bit more watchable. Granted, he plays just about the same guy in almost every movie nowadays but his mere presence among the group of morons they decided to cast in this movie is what kept me from stopping the movie halfway through and just giving up altogether.Overall, I wouldn't recommend WANTED unless you like Angelina Jolie (you do after all get to see her naked wet buttocks along with her terrible acting) or unless you like really stupid Action films with an emphasis on the Action and no brains to the story whatsoever. Also the one disc version of the DVD has absolutely no Extra Features. But with my personal feelings on the movie aside, WANTED has moments of fun in it, great effects and visuals, and an interesting twist in the plot. However, if you're anything like me and can't stand watching films with weak scripts, then you should avoid this movie like the plague because it's about as weak as it gets.2 stars",0,0

The fact that a spectacularly overwhelming majority of the audience failed to see the plot is besides the point. The same amount of people also failed to understand Einstein's theory. Be careful though. This does in no respect mean that ""Fear and loathing..."" is an ingenius film much the same as Einstein couldnt direct a film even though he might've been a genius. Get it? Me neither..2.""Fear and loathing..."" has as much of a plot as all David Lynch's films do together. To anyone disputing this or needing it to be explained i recommend the highly succesful detox programm called ""Watch Fear and Loathing again. And Again. Part II"".3. ""Fear and loathing.."" is a state of the art...art film, which actually is filmed real time by a director seriously suspended in between reality scapes and played by actors who are actually beyond tripped out with the purpose of providing us with a complex and therefore difficult to understand map with the limits of the human mind. It could have been French.4. ""Fear and Loathing..."" is NOT a film. It is actually part of a secret government programm aimed at discouraging our youth in experimenting with a plethora of different drugs simoultaneously. Judging from the reviews here though the programm has failed. Your tax dollars at work once again.5. ""Fear and Loathing..."" will be undisputably understood when Part Two is released (Fear and Loathing in Modevideo) which is due for release in 50 years time. Those alive till then will be awed at the cosmogonic meaning of this film and will ultimately understand how silly they were when they were young and missed the idea because of their naivity.6. ""Fear and Loathing"" is actually an alien film recovered during a UFO crash in South Siberia. The original has -of course- been kept from the public eye and this an adaptation providing us with a glipse into the alien mindset. Did you notice the scene at the beginning with the reptiles at the bar. Well, WINK! Do we have to spell it out for ya????  I do admit that the aforementioned analysis theses are somewhat contradicting. But, I must also admit that i consider myself to be intellectually inadequate to pinpoint which one comes closest to the truth. I think that in reality we all are.  This is a film to be treasured for the ages. And, to be incomprehended for an equal amount of time. Peace...",0,0

R5OUEOCEDWVFN,"Inkheart is a fantastical tale about the power of the printed word, but this family movie doesn't bring the appeal of Cornelia Funke's source novel to compelling life. Inkheart stars Brendan Fraser as Mo Folchart, who's a ""Silvertongue"" -- when he reads books aloud, the fictional characters spring to life. However, this has the unintended consequence of summoning a villain who takes him hostage, and it's up to his daughter Meggie to save him. Inkheart lacks the requisite whimsy and magic, and the result is a fantasy adventure in which a lot happens but too little inspires.",0,0
R36AXBD32VAY37,"I bought this unit as it was highly reccommended by a computer service person. But, I wish I had these reviews first.I installed the unit this last week end and by Sunday night I wish it had come with an accessory sledge hammer. I would have used the hammer on the unit.At best this machine is in ""beta"" form and selling it for full retail price is unfair. TO say the least the software is ""clunky"" and difficult to use. All of the comments of problems in the other reviews are applicable here.I had 4 specific problems and when I got to talk to tech support today I was told to update the firmware and that should solve the problems. If they update the firmware to solve problems you know that many users are complaining.The instruction book is poorly translated from Chinese to English and therefore hard to understand. Even their website has grammer mistakes.THe VHS part in no where as good as the 4 year old Sony that it replaced. Some of the functions ( such as rewind) sound as if it were a thrashing machine.I am sorry I bought the unit, but you never really know how it works until you set it up and use it.A good VHS player ( like my old Sony) and a separate DVD recorder are a better bet.I don't reccommend buying this unit.",0,0

RA5ZFYFZV8VF4,"While I was a huge fan of SF in my youth, I don't follow it much any more.  I now rely on Hugo & Nebula to point me in the direction of worthwhile authors.  What happened here?  Normally I would not bother commenting on garbage books I've read, but this trash won a Hugo.  How???The first third of the book, dealing with children, is interesting enough, but the second two thirds devolve into vapid pointless tedium worthwhile of later Jean Auel.  Spoilers ahead...Do the Hugo voters really believe that a brilliant female would really join a fundamentalist cult?  Are Hugo voters really that misogynist?Can anyone explain the motivations of the narrator?Another review mentioned the lack of action -- let's see, the narrator drives across the US while the nation is in a state of chaos, and has no issues with looters, and only refills his gas tank once?My guess is the Tor editor was too gutless to force a rewrite of this novel.  Structurally, one of the arcs held no tension, due to the female character being in the final arc.Was this really the best SF novel 2006 had to offer?And for all you sycophants giving this book anything more than three stars, have you ever read Childhood's End or Contact?

But Haggis is Canadian so I was not far off.Pretentious, predictable, unwatchable.  The all-star cast could have been scrapped and replaced with racial stereotypes written in gigantic, flashing neon letters that drifted lazily across the screen.To boot, they ripped off the tricky editing technique from ""21 Grams"" of match action cuts from vignette to vignette.The most damning comment is that only a white person would find the movie powerful.

R3CWNUFXIVP4V8,"I purchased a pair of the 8116's after doing some research and reading reviews on these boots. I love the look and at first liked the boot. After about 1-2 months a nail that was holding the sole on, where the ball of the foot is, started to protrude through the insole. I contacted Red Wing and they told me to send the boot in. After 3 weeks without the boot and learning they went in with a bore-scope to rectify the problem, they solved that issue. They did admit that there was an issue and it was fixed. After getting the boots back, there is another nail that holds the sole on that is coming through where the heel of the foot is. Both these issues are with the 'right' boot. The left boot is completely fine. I can barely wear the boot for more than 20-30mins before I can't stand the nail in the bottom of my foot. You can clearly see the nail protruding through the insoleIt is currently winter and I can't go without my boots for another 3 weeks while they again fix this issue. Very unhappy with this product and would not recommend it to anyone.

R3419O61CXTIQ,"Having had a quick look through all the reviews for this film, it seems that there is a general consensus that it's a great film. Well, sorry to be the odd one out, but I found it immensely boring and pretentious. Yes, I  admit that the fight scenes are excellent, breathing new life into screen  combat. But what the hell is the story on about? It really wants to be a  philosophical allegory, including bits on religion and Alice In Wonderland  etc etc. It's not - it comes across some kind of weirdo's fantasy, all  blazing guns and S&M leather (just like Bound, the directors' previous  film). It really has no depth to it at all, but if you want a film to just  enjoy, then  suppose you could do worse than this. You'll just have to wade  through over an hour and a half until you get to anything good...but that's  what DVD can do, so in many ways it's a great film for the format. The  extras are copious and well put together, with the White Rabbit  feature  quite fun along with a great documentary on the filming of the bullet time  technology, all wrapped up in some snazzy menus (but the commentary is  quite tedious). The Matrix thinks it's clever, and spends half the film  trying to tell you this, which is the main reason I didn't like it. That,  and it's boring. Still, it has its moments.

R1XZ532IX6WVHG,"I agree with what reviewer Curtis Reed said about this book.  It is a good read in this genre and I genuinely liked the story.  It was entertaining enough to keep me reading.  The touches of humor were welcome and there were a few standout, memorable lines.What I didn't care for at all was the production values of the book. Cheap paper, lousy, tiny font, and worse editing.  I'm an avid reader and one who does not give up on a book easily, but the poor print quality of this book almost forced me to do so.Even at that, I would have given this book three or four stars if the author hadn't left me hanging at the end.  I really hate that.  An author should never end a book in the middle of a scene.  It's rude and disrespectful to the reader.  I would have greatly preferred it if Joe Nobody had tied this book up when they arrived at their canyon ranch, and then offered a preview of his next book and he could have ended that preview any way he liked without ticking me off.I will not buy his next book in this series because the way he ended this one left me feeling cheated.

R3IKNI5LQ5HHY8,"First of all, I like Motley Crue.  At times, I love them.and as little as 4 years ago, I was hailing them for ""Bitter Pill"" and ""Enslaved."" Those songs are incredible!Alas, this is the first Crue album that doesn't do it for me.  Isn't that strange! Well, yes and no.  Maybe I have a little more tolerance/patience/acceptance than many people, as I don't seem to start calling albums ""bombs"" or whatever until 2 or 3 albums after everyone else.  Only with the most recent ventures of the likes of Def Leppard or Aerosmith, let's say, do I begin to be a little worried.And it's only because I love the bands so much.  I won't give New Tattoo 1 star, because that means poor, and this album isn't poor.  Nikki and the others probably just really wanted to get back to rocking (funny how all bands get that idea after making an album that unnecesariily thinks it needs to be up with the times), and I really respect that.Only problem is, I don't feel it this time.  Dr. Feelgood was magic, but here... I feel that Nikki, Vince, and Mick were so eager just to make this TYPE of album, it was hastily written.  In other words, the concept (and the production!) was there for the taking, but... it's just one of those albums where the magic doesn't make it to tape, and I feel that maybe Nikki or Mick themselves wrote some of those songs without having the wonderful lightbulb come on that says ""this song will be GREAT."" Rather, some of the music sounds forced (""Treat me like a Dog""), like they had to try a little TOO hard to sound sleazy and fun.  So, these songs could have been great, but even in the most uptempo/rocking times (""Fake"", ""First Band on the Moon"", ""Porno Star""), I just don't feel the sincerity.  ""Hair Band Haters"" never have felt that, and many others stopped feeling it after 1989.  Well, it took me this long to unfortunately start feeling similarly.Although not wonderful, there were good creative moments on both the album with Corabi and ""Swine.""  ""New Tattoo"" is the first album I have ever bought where it's as if I was given a musical numbing medication... I just don't feel anything ANYWHERE, from start to finish.  Isn't that strange?I wanted nothing more than for the Crue to evolve and rock on, Leeless or not, I try to be openminded... and Castillo (RIP) wasn't the problem, I loved him on No More Tears, I just sense that Nikki will never find it motivating to MUSICALLY evolve, which, to his pardon, very few rockers do.  And he isn't all that skilled as a bassist, of course. Still, I was optimistic, waiting patiently ever since Dr. Feelgood, not for a remake of it, but for an evolution FROM it, and not just an evolution in production and modern technology, though that's fine too.  I love Nikki's personality and attitude, and he is very intelligent and well articulated.  I'd also like to hear SOME songs reflect that; it's cool to party to songs about women, but I think the Crue is capable of a little more diversity, which would just make the album a little more interesting, overall.The one possible exception is ""Hollywood Ending,"" there's parts in that that I think Vince put emotion into, and the songwriting intrigues me.  Some may find cheese, but don't think I do.  The title track also is a cool song.  But that's it.  The real rockers, although well meant, just don't rock like rock should!Anyone wondering how to start getting into Motley, don't get this album first, but do get it at some point, so you get some sense of chronology  Although I scorn Greatest Hits packages for the ridiculous commercial motives, I will say that Decade of Decadence AND their Greatest Hits have EXELLENT new (at the time) songs.  If this album doesn't get you off, don't think that you won't like the band.  There's just much better stuff out there.This album just isn't fresh and rocking to me, but I'm happy for those of you that it is, cause I'm missing out!",0,0

Unfortunately, these aren't the kind of traits that often lead to interesting music. Not that the band hasn't taken the occasional stabs at creativity and innovation; it's just that those attempts have always been carefully measured, or even nervously self-conscious.""and..""Like Coldplay's two previous albums, only more so, X&Y is bland but never offensive, listenable but not memorable. It may be pointless to hate them, but with this album, they've almost certainly become the easiest band on the planet to be completely indifferent to.""If your a diehard coldplay fan (I'm deffinitely not) then I would expect utter dissapointment.  The production is flawless but empty.  Some people say that Coldplay are just sticking to what they do best, create sappy, off and on insipred nostalghic music that sales extremely well.

R1JDI6678ARX6,"First of all, let me say that I am a big coldplay fan. I own both of their albums and will be seeing them in concert this summer. Rush of blood is one of my favorite albums ever.But, for me X&Y is a disappointment and not up to the standard of the first two albums. All of the songs have a grander, more epic feel to them, but they are hollow at their core. The melodies, rhythms, lyrics, etc. - simply are not interesting or catchy. I'm not even sure I would call them B-Side material, because most of coldplay's B-Sides are better than what is on this album. In fact if you are disappointed by X&Y and have not yet heard any of their B-Sides, I would highly recommend checking out the following songs:MosesBrothers & SistersOnly SuperstitionOne I LoveI Ran AwayTalk (early leaked version)Crest of WavesLadder to the SunMurderAnimalsThat being said, I gave it two stars rather than one because there are still a couple tracks on X&Y that I find agreeable, including square one, the hardest part, and swallowed in the sea.This will not be an undisputed classic like OK Computer or The Joshua Tree.

R24SPP8FCUXC9W,"As a writer - and editor - I would've had many questions to ask Mr. Patterson about this book before sending it to press. After having read practically all of this writer's works, and especially the Women's Murder Club Series, the plot and character development of `The 5th Horseman' fall short of expectation. I love the concept of the Women's Murder Club formed in the first book of the series - four women in San Francisco all in positions that would bring them in contact with murder: the first-person character of SFPD Lt. Lindsay Boxer, SF medical examiner Claire Washburn, crime reporter for the San Francisco Chronicle Cindy Thomas, and attorney-at-law Yuki Castellano, who replaced the original club member Jill Bernhardt, murdered in the third episode.The Prologue of `The 5th Horseman' begins with a murder, one of many, occurring at San Francisco Memorial Hospital. Not mercy killings, these are people who've had an accident and come to the ER or had a life-threatening event bring them to the ER, but stabilized and admitted to the hospital for observation. In other words, they're perfectly healthy individuals due to be released in a day or two--and then they die. All of the clues  point to the head of the ER department, good-looking, arrogant, coldhearted Dr. Dennis Garza. Then there's the subplot--the separate murders of three young, beautiful women killed in one place and their bodies dressed in high-end clothing, each having their genital area sprayed with a specialty perfume, and taken and placed in an expensive car belonging to some unsuspecting individual who evidently forgot to lock the vehicle. The subplot actually works better than the primary one. So we have our main protagonist, Lindsay, up to her neck in murders that aren't getting solved. And she hates her bossy desk job and would rather be doing the footwork in solving the crimes.I used to love James Patterson's books, but of late I've found they are too quick of a read with many loose ends and hanging questions. Granted the doctor antagonist is a scumbag, but more gets hung around his neck than is warranted. However, I don't want to divulge too much and spoil the book for someone who wants to read it. My hope in this review is to have Mr. Patterson take a second look at his character development. It's become shallow and the reader isn't developing rapport with the heroines because of the lack of intimate knowledge of them. Lindsay's love interest Joe was more developed in another book, but that doesn't help the reader who starts the series with this book. Ongoing character evolvement is still necessary. Surely Claire has a life other than ME. Not a lot has been said about Yuki's life, but we're happy in the end that she switches to the other side and isn't defending the bad guys any longer. And we'd like to know more about the lovely Cindy. This book is very short; it's not like there isn't enough space in the pages to develop these characters. It may be a 400-page book, but the formatting eats up a LOT of white space. Please writers, show us more about these characters!",0,0

RSAJXP6XNB9MG,"I love the movie Snatch, and I'm sure I'll post a nice review of the movie somewhere on Amazon. But while the movie is great, the Deluxe Edition (with the poker kit) is a terrible waste of money. Do not purchase.The movie's still great, and all the special features are there, but you can get everything in the ""regular"" release of the movie. Content-wise, there's no real reason to pick up this edition. The Deluxe Edition comes with poker cards, a dealer chip, and a ""scrapbook"". First off, poker wasn't even a big theme in the movie, so the entire inclusion of these elements is a bit iffy. I only picked up this edition because I just so happened to be looking for a deck of playing cards at the time, and figured hey, why not some awesome theme cards? I had no idea what a bad idea that would turn out to be.The poker cards have a nice design, using characters from the films for special cards. The problem is, the cards are completely low-rent and unfinished. They stick together, they don't shuffle well, and the edges don't hold up. There were actually a few bits of paper falling off the cards' edges from the dodgy cutting. The dealer chip is just a piece of low-rent plastic, not an actual poker chip, and the word ""dealer"" was already a little rubbed off from the packaging. The scrapbook is just the sort of useless filmographies and biographies that have become infamous in attempts to fill up special editions, and is easily forgotten.After seeing the extra elements, I just trashed them and kept the DVDs. Don't waste your money. If you're going to get this movie, pick one of the regular editions and just get the movie.",0,0

R1Z41Q4S3WT1AC,"2.5/5I was looking forward to reading this as it sounded like The Passage by Justin Cronin, a vampire apocalypse novel I feel is one of the best vampire books in history. What I instead got was a sloppily written mess of a novel that takes forever to get anywhere, then gains some momentum in the middle, only to lose it at a lackluster ending.As most reviews point out, the writing is juvenile. A good editing would have done this book some good because, as it stands, it's like something that was posted to a writing forum. It's full of bad attempts at humor and this insistence in shoving the fact the author did his research down my throat. The eclipse portion of the book was painful.On top of that is a very slow beginning. I didn't feel any suspense or urgency to the first two hundred or so pages detailing the CDC's investigation of a blacked out plane on which everyone has died. It's slow and builds up to the big reveal of vampires that I knew was coming anyway so, in the end, doesn't matter in the least. All this buildup, the big reveal, then two hundred pages of jumping around to a bunch of side characters having to deal with the vampire breakout. Then two hundred pages of our main characters attempting to kill the lead vampire, the Master, and not getting anywhere. Making it feel like most of this book isn't even needed. There's so much filler to pad out the book it gets painful to read.On top of that, the much lauded action sequences are dull and poorly written and the vampires themselves (though with some cool ideas thrown in) aren't scary at all. The scariest part of the book is the cover, in which a worm is coming out of a lady's eyeball.This is a very average book. It's readable, I find myself preparing to crack open the second novel in this trilogy, but it's also below par for something as well reviewed as it is. It's not epic, it's not redefining. It's just kinda there.",0,0
R394XJINVQ08HX,"This is not a well written book. It does not flow well at all. The narrative is at times very detailed and then it jumps forward years at a time.

R36SU66OI7L0RS,"Let me tell you a story:A long long time ago (in a galaxy far far away) there was a young farm boy living with his uncle.  He had never known his parents, and his uncle didn't like to talk about them.  One day, the farm boy's life is changed forever.  He finds a mysterious object, then later comes home one day to find his uncle dead.  The house (and uncle) go up in flames, and the farm boy goes off with a secretive experienced old mentor.  The mentor teaches him how to use a glowing sword.  The farm boy also learns about the evil leader and those who fight against him.  Along the way, he meets a beautiful girl (and she is an AWESOME fighter) and a shifty, ""street-wise"" friend.By the way, if you are not seeing a VERY FIRM connection to Star Wars at this point, you have obviously never seen the Star Wars movies.I just don't understand what people see in this book!  The plot is old, old, OLD!!!  Did anyone else notice that the plot is simply Star Wars set in medieval times?  Eragon, the ""hero"" is extremely annoying and shallow.  Another thing that bothered me is when they spoke first in medieval, then in teen slang.  I also found this book to be EXTREMELY lacking in girl characters.  The only female character (besides the dragon) was a silent elf girl who was in a coma for an entire half of the book!

R3O8F0U00DEHQ7,"I was extremely disappointed with this film after all the hype. There were so many cliches in it- the homophobe who is a closet homosexual, the sexually repressed suburban couple who end up having affairs to get out of their stale lives, the militarist who happens to have Nazi memoribilia, the girl whom everybody wants who turns out to be dull and insecure and sexually inexperienced etc. The filming was not particularly great either. Lawn Dogs perhaps examines bourgeois/suburban paranoia and complexes with better skill.So what does work at all? Perhaps a non-American directing, or the eccentric boy across the street who turns out to be the most interesting character. Oh and a couple of mildly funny jokes.

R3G7WF1UAY93I2,"This is a short book. It would be even shorter without the first 30 pages or so, which consists of a lengthy but well-written summary of `The Hound of the Baskervilles.' While this recap is not really necessary to the audience for this book--for how many people would care to read this book without having first read the original?--it may serve useful for readers wishing to refresh their memories of the novel. I had just read `The Hound...' and I read it, although I did not know that it would take up such a large portion of the book.My first reservation concerns Bayard's interpretation of this novel as a simple police procedural, a mystery containing an obvious solution in the manner of most of the stories that preceded it in the series. `The Hound of the Baskervilles,' however, is as much an atmospheric fantasy as it is a detective story. It owes as much to `Wuthering Heights' or the frenzied stories of Edgar Allan Poe as it does to any previous detective fiction written by Doyle or anyone else. What Bayard interprets as Doyle `stacking the deck' to make us believe the family legend of the Baskervilles as well as the possibility that it might be being reenacted in the novel's present time I see as missing much of the force of the novel. In a Poe story, one doesn't question the existence of Roderick Usher's dead but zombie-like sister or whether the initial narrator of `Wuthering Heights' REALLY perceives the ghost of Cathy trying to enter his room. Bayard carefully picks apart Doyle's, through Watson's, word choices--""running desperately,"" ""crazed with fear,"" ""the desolate, lifeless moor"" He claims that these phrases deliberately manipulate the reader into accepting the pseudo supernatural explanation of seemingly bizarre events. I would counter, however, that this is word painting and mood setting, as any good storyteller and fiction writer would do. Poe, Lovecraft, and dozens of other writers have built entire careers on such techniques and Doyle is venturing into that territory and largely leaving realistic detective fiction behind, at least on this occasion.Bayard also makes entirely too much of Doyle's `hatred' of his greatest creation. His explanation of how Doyle tried to kill off his hero and then reluctantly brought him back to life while resisting giving him full freedom to `live' within the pages distorts his interpretation of the mystery while being oblivious to the other factors such as the aforementioned gothic mood setting as well as the broadening of his scope to encompass not only Watson's experience but the effect of these `desolate, lifeless moors' on its disturbed inhabitants. While he cites accurate instances of inconsistencies where the clues do not add up and even uses the analogy of the master magician focusing the audience's attention elsewhere when he performs his real tricks, he fails to realize that he himself is duped by Doyle's magic and pursues an alternate path to lead to the `real' murderer, or rather, murderess. He attributes far too many qualities of a diabolical murderer to Beryl Stapleton than any of her actions warrant. While he makes some plausible points--the mysterious figure that trails Mortimer, Holmes and Henry Baskerville in London could quite possibly be Beryl--he follows a path to a conclusion that makes less sense than any conclusion accepted by Holmes, Watson or legions of readers for over a hundred years. Just to take one example, he simply states that Beryl tied herself up. How can one tie herself up, much less inflict bruises upon herself with the strength of a man? This statement alone is utterly absurd but Bayard fails to even provide a plausible explanation of the result.This is a short book; therefore, this is a short review, which ends here.",0,0

R3IA5WFFGK2E13,"I'm being generous with my 2 star rating.  If it wasn't a WWII movie, which I'm partial to, and for the fact that I have seen worse, I'd have scored it lower.I've watched this movie several times and it has always disturbed me. Today it got to me so much that I had to turn it off and find something else.What is disturbing is the Hollywood interpretation of what jungle warfare was like and what military protocol is like.In the opening scenes we have the unit commander chewing out the sergeant for talking back and questioning the orders.  Then the rest of the movie is about the sergeant's detail - all bickering with him and questioning his decisions and his ability to lead.Skip Homeier does his job really well in this movie, but that is really his stock in trade.  Even in the cowboy movies, his role was usually the junior player with the whinning, complaining, bickering personality.Even Toni Curtis gets in on the ""challenge-the-Sarge-at-every-turn"" campaign which is or eventually became ""Out of Character"" for him.But the rub is that this sort of insubordination was not tolerated in the military.  If anyone had tried this pull this sort of malarky and survived the ordeal, they would have been put up for courts martial as soon as they returned.But Hollywood needs to develop tension in a movie.  Tension and release, tension and release, over and over is what allows the plot to build and climax.  When the tension is real, like honest fear, hardship, tragedy etc, it works well, but in the abscense of any real anxiety or stress, script writers try to manufacter it with this childish bickering.  THAT is the mark of a substandard plot/story.  I have seen it work in some films but only because the director knew how to handle it and keep it at a minimum.

She does whatever she wants, says whatever she wants and no one really stands in her way(her step-mother offers the only resistance, however limply). Juno's a rotten little twit.What I really didn't like was the ominous feeling that the film was going to try to turn around and give her a sympathetic makeover. Sure enough. After spending most of the film being rude to everyone and getting her way she can't handle it when one of the other characters finally peels himself off the background and does something she doesn't like. Now she's fragile and emotional...doesn't stop her from continuing being rude though.The only sweet moments are when Juno's mouth is shut and the soundtrack comes to the front. It felt really manipulative having such upbeat music in a movie about such a jerk.The mailbox full 'o Tic Tacs was pure insulting treacle. She treats Michael Cera's character like a cure for boredom(essentially how she got pregnant), then as an insignificant nuisance up until she the wants him back. That's where the Tic Tacs come in. Aww, she really does love him and he goes for it. Tic Tacs? If any candy fits him it's a Sucker!The biggest insult came at the end in the hospital after she's given birth.

Or the possessive ""only I can touch you"" man that Trey is. Well wake up call Trey, you just let six other guys go a little beyond innocent touching. And Taryn! She may have been immature, but she was a strong female lead, and suddenly she is being submissive to six guys and is okay with being totally demeaned!And the pack? They all are protective of her and take care of her like a sister, all of who are suddenly shoving their penises in her mouth and holding her down(*cough* rape *cough*). Then to make this whole experience even more disturbing is the dirty talk which borders on how a rapist talks to its victim. And what does Taryn do? She takes it all and doesn't get mad once. Not once!And then the icing on the cake: her child is conceived when she is being gang banged. Seriously? How is that cool? That is disgusting...poor kid.

RCCIB8V1KDESE,"I rented and viewed ""The Day After Tomorrow"" recently.I was bored throughout and would have simply turned it off and hit ""rewind"", had I not paid to see the movie.I had read nothing but negative reviews of ""The Day After Tomorrow"" and had rented it with the intention of setting straight those who were so critical of a movie depicting the nightmare worst case scenario of global warming--something I consider to be a real possibility.Sadly, I must now join the chorus of critics of Roland Emmerich's latest cliche-ridden disaster flick.The film is characterized by a suffocating concoction of dauntless American heroism and sappy traditional home and family values rubbed into the viewer's nose ad nauseum--a reflection, no doubt, of the mood now prevalent in this nation.There is also excessive Hollywood style special effect sock, bang and pow noise and violence where a thoughtful examination of the very real issue of global warming might have been more helpful.Additionally, as per Hollywood's stock in trade formula, inordinately intelligent African Americans spout endless profundities, while no Native American, Hispanic or Arab American says or does anything noteworthy.There is even a quasi-supernatural demonization of escaped zoo wolves at one point to further annoy the thoughtful viewer.And a child-like PG 13 rendition of a sanitized hand-holding romance between two brainy students is as near as the movie comes to anything romantic.Global warming is a serious and pressing problem for the human species--one made more so by the Bush administration's refusal to sign the Kyoto Protocol.But Emmerich's ""The Day After Tomorrow""--a movie that could have been a great teaching tool--so trivializes the issue that the cause of enlightenment about the perils of global warming may have been done more harm than good.I was very disappointed by ""The Day After Tomorrow"".D.

R3MSP4MYAJZLTA,"My review here is quite belated, but I hope to bring out certain points pertinent to Dr Schoch's competence outside the field of Geology, as well as the fallacies in some of his arguments. The book is mis-titled. There is nothing but cursory descriptions of ancient voyages, much less who the builders of the pyramids actually were wherever they are found. There is no new information on this theme here. Nearly all the information is based on traditional thinking, rather than cutting edge developments. Dr Schoch needs to read a lot more and stay abreast of contemporary research. Much of what he writes about in his books is the same old tripe he was indoctrinated with during his baccalaureate. Despite this, he asserts that the evidence coming forward changes the traditional linear view of civilization's development. In the first chapter he tells the reader civilization is much older than estimated by scholars, but makes the immediate gaffe of stating civilization spread from Sumer to Egypt. In fact, what is known is that Sumer was an offshoot of an older civilization (dispute between Egyptian and Indian), and at the fall of Sumer there was a reciprocal cultural influence by Sumer upon Egypt, for the two were never completely out of touch with each other. The one thing you won't find in any of his books is scientific data that he has acquired through original research. He is not doing what a reputable scientist like Thomas Brophy did, lay out his investigations, present the data, and propose an hypothesis. Rather, in his books he uses his title as PhD to authenticate his speculations.Dr. Schoch has a striking tendency to contradict himself. In the introduction he announces that the pyramids of Egypt and elsewhere are older than originally presumed, but in the first chapter details the traditional dates. He uses the Atlas of Ancient Egypt for his source material, published in 1980. In the second chapter he introduces the modest changes in his dating. But here it is nothing but his trained opinion against the established thinking. There is no conclusive testing and resultant data.In his retelling of the Howard-Vyse inscription dilemma, he declares the source for the fraudulence of the inscription derives from Sitchin, yet he presents no evidence of his own to substantiate his assertion that the inscription associates Khufu with building the pyramid. Although the inscription in ochre paint could be carbon dated, it is well known that carbon 14 decay is heavily influenced by solar and galactic radioactive sources. The assumption behind C14 dating is the notion that decay rates are constant, which was known to be a conceptual error at the time of Schoch's printing this book. This has an impact on the conflicting dates found in the pyramid mortar and underscores the scientific regression from C14 dating as a reliable method.Dr. Schoch introduces the subject of the calendar circle at Nabta Playa, Egypt. Here he assigns dates to the area from 7,000 BC of nomadic settling, to 5,500 BC with a complex social system. It so happens that Dr. Schoch wrote the forward to Thomas Brophy's The Origin Map, published a full two years before this book. (He was in possession of Brophy's manuscript by Nov 2001.) Reviewing his comments there reveals that he knew full well the details of the calendar circle and other structures in the area, as well as Brophy's dating of the circle to not only 4,940 BC, but 6,400 BC and as early as 16,500 BC. Brophy assigns a construction date of the circle at 6,800 BC. Schoch's errors ranging from 25-50% (using Brophy's dating as the baseline) does not reflect the respectability attributed to this geologist. This seriously undermines Dr. Schoch's dating cited in his Voyages book and is suggestive of an attempt to bend the facts to lend greater weight to his own date estimations. Such equivocation has prompted my wife to redefine PhD in Dr. Schoch's case to mean Poor History Duff.Trust a geologist to say that the ""point of a pyramid is its mass"" instead of its point. The mass of a pyramid is not what matters, it's the dimensions that encode important relationships to be preserved to posterity. The Scandinavians call them Minehallens, or memorial halls. In the second chapter he mentions the pyramids are monuments and memorials to dead kings, but misses the central idea that they were considered portals for the king's soul in the afterlife (only later does he hint at this as an after-thought). If a pyramid is a representation of the axis mundi, and is constructed to align with certain stars, reflecting in its dimensions the very relationship of the earth with the rest of the universe, it then symbolizes the passageway for the soul to not only return home, but achieve immortality, as detailed in the Egyptian Book of the Dead. In this context, they were not built as monuments to honor the dead king, but facilitate his ascension in the afterlife. How can a PhD miss so elementary a principle? He rambles on about concepts of which he has no grasp.In his 2001 preface to The Origin Map he exudes confidence in Brophy's work on the pyramid alignments, citing the work of Bauval. Then two years later denigrates Bauval's work for being overly ""precise"" and ""exact in their correlations"" considering the weathering of the pyramids, when Brophy's plots are even more exacting than Bauval's! This highlights the difference between a good engineer (Bauval) and a theoretical scientist (Schoch). Take a look at typical coursework differences between a Geologist and an Engineer. You will find far more courses required for the engineer in Calculus, Physics, and Chemistry, depending on discipline than for a Geologist. In my undergraduate program I was required to complete six semesters of Calculus, because methods of solutions to a broad range of problems in physics is essential to engineering competence. A good engineer can measure a site and determine to the precision of his instruments where the corner of a monument was intended to be. Knowing the ideal shape of the structure he can reconstruct the original design plot by the ancient planners. This is a similar problem with facial recognition/restoration programs developed for photographic application. A statistical accuracy of 99% is defined as ""highly significant"", 90% as ""significant"" in science and this is precisely the accuracy obtained by Bauval. Compared to Brophy's analysis, Bauval attained 90% accuracy with a first order approximation. Yet Schoch wants to criticize Bauval's work, which was sustained by the physicist whom he lauds, and Schoch apparently lacks the mathematical skill necessary to expatiate the issue.Get this one: ""When the recently arrived Pilgrims were clueless as to how to grow crops in the strange, new land of what is now Massachussetts, the local Indians showed them the way, saving the whites from starvation.""(p78) How can a PhD be so ignorant and imprecise with regard to early colonial American history? Easy. A Geologist is not required to know anything significant about American history. Does he honestly believe the Pilgrims didn't know anything about raising crops in a climate comparable to their homeland? There is more to the story of imminent Pilgrim starvation than the nuances of raising corn or squash in central New England. If the reader cannot be served the accuracy and precision the author demands of others, how can anything he writes be accepted with confidence?One of the chief difficulties in describing the past scholars and scientists have is refraining from describing what happened, and inventing causal relationships, as if they had lived then. The amount of evidence they have to support their assertions is scant, and they really are doing the public a disservice when they speculate under the guise of scholarly authority as though their opinions were fact. Another problem is the tendency to interpret the past anachronistically. The reader will find such gaffes scattered throughout Dr. Schoch's writings.In chapter four Dr Schoch attempts to introduce the problems between amateurs and experts, and scientific specialists who know little about each other's ""research."" Right here one should find a twinge of conscience by Dr Schoch, for as a geologist he is faring into historical, anthropological, and cultural areas knowing his ignorance is plainly manifest to anyone staying abreast of developments. This is an inferred admission that his expertise is compartmentalized. In this chapter he introduces the problems of Zecharia Sitchin and Erich von Daniken, as if these writers could lend elevation by contrast to his own vaunted knowledge! They should not even be mentioned in a serious presentation on diffusionism. If he really wanted to contrast his ""research"", he should be using the findings of his peers, not the opinions of popular press ""investigators."" This is just plain shoddy scholarship.By page 100 out of 304 I'm seeing such a strong trend I find it is pointless to finish the book. The interested reader should take a word to the wise here, and look elsewhere if they are seriously interested in learning more about the ancient past. Dr Schoch has joined the popular scientific fringe crowd and presents no serious research and analysis worthy of his accolades.",0,0

All of a sudden I felt in Never Call Retreat it seemed GeneralGrant comes in with one master plan to defeat Lee not just in one battlebut with one battle that settles the whole war. I felt that Newt Gingrichhad written himself into a corner with the first 2 books and this was theonly way he could write himsself out of it successfully. Everyone knowshow successfull how Lee was in real life and we are introduced to thisin the first book and it continues on into the second book. We don't getthis with General Grant Like a previous reviewer said with him you getomni-potent powers where everything just falls into place for Grant. I was disappointed with this book. If anything I could have seen the thirdbook having a series of inconclusive battles between Grant and Lee thathappened in real life that could have set up a fourth book that ended upat Appomatix. Not a book where it writes Grant has arrived the War is over now. Sorry General Lee but you're really a second rate general nowthat I've arrived, but that is my take.",0,0
R2M4E1XRMXYW8F,This book is full of crap! Washed up feldman bashing his so called friend the late haim. Haim would be pissed. Hes basically saying haim was a homo and loved to screw men and wanted to sleep with feldman. BS! of course he writes this crao when haim is DEAD AND CANT DEFEND HIMSELF. how do we know any of that is true. He should of wrote aboit himseld and thats it! To say that crap about haim who by the way is a better actor just goes to show how shallow amd desperate this idiot is. HES BROKE PEOPLE! THIS IS ALL FOR MONEY AND NOTHING MORE! hell he doesnt even own his house. He rents. And owes 10000 bucks in past rent. He has no starring roles anymore he hardly is in movies at all except a tiny role in DTV movies.  I used to like feldman until he wrote this garbage about his dead friend. Theres 2a sides to every story. Unfortunately we will only get 1. To say anything negative about a so called best friend who cant defend any of it is pure shallow. No wonder why SO MANY PEOPLE DONT LIKE FELDMAN ANYMORE. AMD PLEASE STOP ACTING LIKE MICHEAL JACKSON!,0,0
RFEXXVRLTCREK,"Sloppy, sloppy, so sloppy. I have read Anne Bishop’s The Black Jewels and found that to be a good combination of her easy-to-read writing and a well constructed, unique fantasy world.Written In Red, however, is just not. It feels like a series written under a deadline and stretched out insufferably across many books for a payday.The world in Written in Red feels so barely drawn that when I finished the book, I couldn’t help feeling like the author had foreshadowed my disappointment on the first page, which is a simply drawn map with the disclaimer: “This map was created by a geographically challenged author who put in only the bits she needed for the story.” That seems to be how she wrote the book as well. There are dozens of characters, not one of them brought to life. People and places have filler names like Bigwig and Sparkletown. Everything feels just barely done. Considering how many times “meat” is talked about in the book, the book really has no meat, no substance.I finished reading it (barely) because Bishop’s writing style is so easy- which is the same reason I’m giving it two stars. But if you are looking for a good fantasy book to get lost in, this isn’t it. If, however, you’re looking for a quick book to leave you annoyed, you found it.",0,0

R3NGPGGT4JE998,"When amazon delivered my copy of Alain de Botton's `Religion for Atheists' a couple of weeks ago, I read the first chapter, `Wisdom without Doctrine', a few days before I went on to read the rest of the book.  This first chapter struck me as the worst-presented argument I had ever read.  I am absolutely astonished at the case which de Botton presented there, and which, as I later read through the book, he repeats and repeats and repeats and then summarizes in his final chapter on `Institutions', in which he tells us that Auguste Comte (1798-1857) had anticipated much of what he (de Botton) is now proposing and recommending, but which Comte failed to implement and which de Botton seems to have no hope of being able to implement either.de Botton ends his introductory chapter with this paragraph:  "" ... this book ... tries ... to examine aspects of religious life which contain concepts that could fruitfully be applied to the problems of secular society.  It attempts to burn off religions' more dogmatic aspects in order to distil a few aspects of them that could prove timely and consoling to sceptical contemporary minds facing the crises and griefs of finite existence on a troubled planet.  It hopes to rescue some of what is beautiful, touching and wise from all that no longer seems true"" (p. 19).In this unbelievably blinkered book, de Botton makes a number of statements which are so naïve and unproved and unprovable and hopelessly cloud-cuckoo-land-ish that one must wonder how any publisher (here, Penguin) would publish it.I quote:  "" ... let us bluntly state that of course no religions are true in any God-given sense"" (p. 11).  What proof does de Botton produce for this statement?  None whatsoever, neither here nor anywhere else in his book.  He goes on:  ""Tough-minded critics of religion have found much pleasure in laying bare the idiocy of believers in remorseless detail, finishing only when they felt that they had shown up their enemies as thorough-going simpletons or maniacs"" (p.11).  de Botton never mentions the huge scholarly arguments which thoroughly disprove the atheists' case and show that it is the atheists who are the enemies of philosophy, common sense, and science.  The verdict which de Botton passes on the believing `simpletons and maniacs' is simply correctly attributable to de Botton himself.I quote from a review of a book similar to de Botton's, by his fellow-atheist AC Grayling, `The God Argument:  the Case against Religion and for Humanism'.  The review of Grayling's book says:  ""People are still debating whether or not `Life of Pi', book or film, can make you believe in God.  The novel didn't have that effect on me.  AC Grayling's book came much closer:  his `case for humanism' made me begin to long for faith ... What's most lamentable about this book [Grayling's] is not the quirks of tone, the Infelicities of emphasis or the inconsistency, indeed occasional lack, of method.  It's the façade of appreciating how believers have created great art, without recognizing the imaginative process behind it, and indeed behind faith"".  [The review is by Tom Payne, and appears in the Daily Telegraph's Saturday magazine supplement `Review', of 23 February 2013  -  before the Oscars considered the film `The Life of Pi'.]I can quote in the same sense Lord Rees (the Astronomer Royal), and the philosopher John  Gray and  Richard Dawkins, all atheists (or nearly so), who all agree that random atoms cannot account for the great art and music and literature of the Christian tradition  -  but they can offer no alternative explanation.  They simply expect us to believe that in some mysterious way the random atoms MUST be able eventually to explain this fact.De Botton goes on:  ""The premise of this book is that it must be possible to remain a committed atheist and nevertheless find religions sporadically useful, interesting and consoling, and be curious as to the possibilities of importing certain of their ideas and practices into the secular realm"" (pp. 11,12).  Notice the absurdity of de Botton's case.  He does not say that his book will show how it is possible to remain a committed atheist and nevertheless ...""  He tells us instead that IT MUST BE POSSIBLE TO REMAIN A COMMITTED ATHEIST AND NEVERTHELESS find religions sporadically useful ... "".  But this is an act of blind atheistic faith.  It is what his book should be attempting to prove.  But he offers not one shred of proof.  WHY MUST IT BE POSSIBLE TO REMAIN A COMMITTED ATHEIST AND NEVERTHELESS ... ""?de Botton goes on:  ""We can then recognize that we invented religions [trini asks:  did `we' invent Jesus Christ and the New Testament?] to serve two central needs which continue to this day and which secular society has not been able to solve with any particular skill:  first, to live together in communities in harmony, despite our deeply rooted selfish and violent impulses.  And second, the need to cope with terrifying degrees of pain which arise from our vulnerability to professional failure, to troubled relationships, to the death of loved ones and to our decay and demise.  God may be dead, but the urgent issues which impelled us to make him up still stir and demand resolutions which do not go away when we have been nudged to perceive some scientific inaccuracies in the tale of the seven loaves and fishes"" (p. 12).  One simply cannot take de Botton seriously as a thinker.  He seems unable to perceive any link between effect and cause.  He tells us that 'religions' which we invented, created the answers to all human problems, but nevertheless religion can't have created these solutions, because religion doesn't exist independently.He goes on:  ""I never wavered in my certainty that God did not exist.  I was simply liberated by the thought that there might be a way to engage with religion without having to subscribe to the supernatural content"" (p. 14). [Really?}  And so on and so on.  De Botton endlessly praises religion for providing all the answers to mankind's problems, but he goes on and on and on saying that religion `invented' these correct solutions, and that it is now up to atheism to provide the same solutions to these same problems, but without a `religious' base, and only after removing from these solutions everything that religion provided as the solutions (but which de Botton, with total illogicality, will not concede to be the very reason why these solutions worked).  The trouble for de Botton, however, is that, as he everywhere recognizes, there is no sign whatever of purely secular, atheistic, humanistic concepts and purely atheistic, secular and humanistic `thinkers ` ever being able to make the required solutions work.  For de Botton, the religious explanation (`plan A') must be eliminated, but over and over again de Botton concedes that his atheistic solution (`plan B') will not work with real human beings in the real world in which we live, and he has no `plan C'.  (What about returning to `plan A'?)There is the continuous insistence by de Botton, in every chapter, that every human need has been met by traditional religious (especially Christian) teachings and practices and institutions, but unbelievably he thinks it is now the task of the atheists to re-make and re-found all these dying (but essential) Christian practices and institutions with exactly similar (but atheistically founded) practices and institutions  -  which de Botton repeatedly admits will not and cannot work.Nietzsche, God is not dead.de Botton, atheism is dead.",0,0
R2Q8VDYZH4G55O,"Except for cinematography by Vittorio Storaro, this film is way over rated. It is totally homophobic. The entire premise of the reason the protagonist was a Fascist murderer is because he thought he accidentally shot and killed a man who molested, or at least tried to molest him once when he was 13. The man was 6-10 years older. So he became a murderer for Mussolini. WTF? What about all those dozen adult men and women who are shown standing two feet away while a dozen kids his age have his pants pulled down and are molesting him en masse, for who knows how many times. No, that would not make him a murderer. The guy who molested him was not a homosexual. He was a child molester, because the boy was prepubescent, presumably. Later in the film, we see the ""homosexual"" trying to pick up a much older male prostitute. I don't think child molesters evolve to like older people as sexual partners, so this is not true to life. He is also shown to be a total wimp, a stereotype. The protagonist's new wife confesses to having been raped for 6 years by a man 50 years older and says she enjoyed it. She seems as normal as anybody in the film. Talk about a double standard! The director should have followed the golden rule of filmmaking: Make films about things you know about. The dialogue, dubbed or not is ridiculous. It's so baldly dubbed, they could have said intelligent things that people might actually say. added bonus, gratuitous exploitation of the star actresses tits. You can see the blue gel wrapping the dance room moving in the wind. The only person not dancing was the Fascist murderer and his assistant. How inconspicuous. Brutally grotesque murder scene tops it off. Francis Ford Coppola, Sidney Lumet, and other filmmaker wrote a letter to talk an American distributor into distributing the film. Perhaps they first should have consulted with their gay friends to see how they felt about being stereotyped in film or on TV as child molesters, too typical of the time the film was made, 1970.",0,0
R2OLTHHYZLRGAF,"This book was recommended by the instructor from the ReadyPoint Live Review that was mandatory for my class to take for our NCLEX-RN review. If I had a choice, I would've chosen Hurst Review instead. The Live Review had so many Q&A discrepancies to which the instructor would just say, ""Oh, we'll have to fix that powerpoint slide"". You would think they'd make sure the materials they presented went through proofreading. That alone should've discouraged me from buying this but thought maybe the books is different. I like how the book is divided into Client Need Categories and the way it is bulleted with key highlights to remember on a specific topic/system. What I don't like is that there are (AGAIN!) discrepancies on some of the end of chapter quiz answers. For instance on one question, it says the answer is 2 but the rationale is clearly speaking about answer 3. It's so confusing!

R3CZHMK526WPFD,"My original review is below and it was great. Now the blinds will not retract and are worthless and a waste of money because now I have to go buy new blinds and replace all of DEZ blinds I bought. It looks like the cord one one side of the blind that runs down the entire blind from top to bottom has frayed in one spot and balled up. This has created a stopping point and will not allow the blind to be retracted beyond that point. Be careful because after a year its hit or miss if they will actually retract and now about a year and half later my main blind will not retract. Very disappointed.I bought these because I wanted black out blinds and I have to say I'm very impressed. The install was painless, once the brackets are screwed in (two screws) the blinds easily snap into place. They pull down and go up with ease and they are truly black out. They are stylish enough that I have not installed curtains and actually have no need for them. Overall I'm extremely pleased with these blinds and will be purchasing more for the rest of the house.",0,0

R2K6TO5YD8A0NX,"Having debated long on it, I decided to rate this book purely by its story and not by the author's research (which is extensive and I salute her for it - but I could get that from history books.)I cannot recall ever coming away from a book with a worse feeling in the pit of my stomach and with so much rage at the author. Not because of the tragedies heaped on the characters. I did not expect a fluffy ending tied with a pink bow. What I expected was a modicum of respect for me as a reader.My main reason for hating it so much is this: All the set-ups were empty promises! The author had no idea how wrap things up. I felt she was terrified of confrontations. Because nothing gets resolved. All the fantastic threads of Part A become a tangled mess in Part B and the end was another big set-up that screamed of ""Go buy the sequel!""I know it is hard to believe my critique after so many reviewers raved about this book. The thing is, I totally understand why - the book is wonderfully written but it should come with a big warning tag that says: MAJOR FRUSTRATION AHEAD!Here are the things that killed the book for me:1. The big problem with the main characters - never resolved (and the author went to great length to do that, like making the husband so sick he could not talk and explain. And of course in his letter he said, ""This is not something to be discussed in a letter."" Arggg...)2. The long list of sub-characters with their endless thoughts - not important in the end. You can skip them - trust me! Especially that boring Jane character.3. The counter-hero the author developed throughout the book - gets nothing. Goes to waste. So why did the author tell us about him anyway?4. The heroine, Bab, changes abruptly from the person I rooted for and felt for to something unrecognizable and unbelievable. From a misguided teenagers who insists on marrying the wrong man, she becomes her grandmother's pawn, because having lost faith in her own judgment (and if you read the book you will understand why), she totally loses control over her life, her wants, her dreams for the future. I felt that Bab just lost it at some point. She gave up (at 20!) She didn't know what to do with herself and so handed the reins to her grandmother and did what the old woman said, which was basically to run away like a ditz. Another unbelievable twist since the grandma Alice had a wonderful life in which she was a queen in control. Bab began as a sweet, spirited girl, and ended as a too-stupid-to-live mess of a woman. Did I say a total ditz?5. The slap-in-my face jump from the second before the great climax of the story to years ahead was just rude. That really pissed me off.I kept reading, hoping for resolutions - and never got them. The author pours research into the book as if the pages are vessels for repetitive descriptive details (how many times do I need to read about all the powders and rouges on the vanity table? of the flowers? the clouds? the furniture? the trees? the holidays season?) I could get a magazine for that. When i buy a book i want a story with characters that DO THINGS and  take charge of the pages.It felt as though  two different people wrote the book: the good Dr. Jekyll wrote Part A and the crazed Mr. Hyde wrote Part B. The good build-up totally disintegrated in the end.This is not good literature. I don't care what people say. Look up Aristotle's POETICS and find out why. This book was worse than bad - it insulted my intelligence.Having read DARK ANGELS and raved about it with my review, I immediately bought the next 2 books in the series. Having read this book, I threw the 3rd - a brand new book - into my trash can without a second thought. I am not treating myself to more abuse from this author.",0,0

R1Y9FSHCYSV8Y2,"Review courtesy of Dark Faerie TalesQuick & Dirty: This main character grated on my nerves, but other than her, the story bored me half to death.Opening Sentence: Viv stood in front of the mirror, painstakingly sabotaging her appearance.The Review:Vivian is trapped in a Snow White curse. It’s not a pleasant one. She’s doomed to one of two lives — one in which her love, who was deemed the Huntsman, kills her, or one in which he lets her live on only to watch her marry another. When she gets an invitation to the underworld, she meets the boy cursed to be her prince, who offers her a safe haven in his palace where they can delay the inevitable. But try as she might, Viv is not in love with Jasper. She’s in love with the one who will cut out her heart or leave her forever. Which choice is better? Is there any way to break her curse, or is fate something that cannot be escaped?I’ve been stuck with Tear You Apart for months. At one point, it took weeks to get from 30 percent to 35. Here I am, at 60 percent, after trudging my way through each never-ending page. I accept defeat. I simply am not enjoying the book. I no longer care for how Viv’s life ends up. Honestly? I’d be fine if she died in the end in an unexpected twist. At least it would be interesting. I have no interest in the characters, the plotline, or the world. I bear them no ill will, either — it wasn’t a problem with me hating the book, it was a problem with me being unable to find a reason to read on. I can say with complete honesty that Tear You Apart bored my socks off. I can also say that is the first and last time I will ever use that figure of speech. My review today will be short and sweet, because I have no interest on dwelling on this failed read any longer than necessary.Vivian was a boring character to me. She was dull. She whined. She invoked the only emotion I felt with anyone in this story: irritation. She constantly withered in her self-pity bubble. No one or nothing else really mattered but her plight. She was pointless and I didn’t find a sliver of connection between me and Viv. Isn’t she supposed to be caring about the birdies and the dwarves, being Snow White? Nah, she’ll just be sad about herself. Her relationship with Huntley was where I really started to dislike her. She was so unkind to him! They have a history, and she’s not helping her whole “don’t kill me” case by pushing him away and being generally bitchy, forgive my language. Maybe if I had stuck it out for the rest of the book, I might have seen Vivian’s redemption, but I just can’t imagine a world in which Vivian and Huntley (whom she “loves”) are a good couple.The wicked stepmother was the only character in the story whom I liked. She had motivations, and a backstory to match. Her intentions were evil, but there were underlying themes to her character, perhaps the one thing in the book done right. Viv is so hypocritical concerning Regina, (they mooched the Once Upon a Time stepmother name!) going off and off about how she didn’t choose her curse, when Regina didn’t either. She grew up believing she was Snow White. Do you think she felt happy knowing that she’d been labeled evil? It was a self-fulfilling prophecy. She didn’t have the most pleasant life either. She gave into darkness to protect the part of her that hurt so badly when she heard of her husband cheating on her, or heard the mirror tell her that Vivian was prettier than she was.Okay, altogether, not my favorite novel. There were barely any merits that I can name. I was so bored! The pacing seemed slow. And there’s this beautiful, horrible, unique world, one that (had it been done better) I would have appreciated. It was like the Once Upon a Time world with more modern technology and multiple versions of the same characters. I wasn’t able to enjoy the world. Maybe the fact that I didn’t read Kill Me Softly before I read this changed my opinion, because I know many people loved that one. Oh, and this book almost became the only book that’s ever put me to sleep! Congratulations! I was reading Tear You Apart and then realized the book was slipping from my hands and my eyes were closing. I snapped out of it and turned off the Kindle to protect its battery life before giving into the snooze fest. I wouldn’t recommend this unless you liked Kill Me Softly. Perhaps you’ll like this one as well.Notable Scene:True love’s kiss was supposed to be natural between a cursed prince and princess. You were supposed to feel like you’d known each other a lifetime. But Viv knew what it felt like to know someone your whole life and to love him, and it didn’t feel like this.Fate and magic were supposed to bind them together, but she felt like her heart had been cut from her chest.FTC Advisory: EgmontUSA provided me with a copy of Tear You Apart.

R1D8ETQBGBP70J,"""She's Out Of My League"" is a good film - no doubt. The dialogue ruined it, though. If you like to hear the ""F- "" word every 2 minutes,  then is your kind of film! Another thing about this film, even though is a  Boy-meets-girl,  breaks-up- with -girl, and gets-girl-back type of film,  the good is it teaches young people to quit rating yourselfs as ""a ten"" or a ""five"".  I always have stressed that to younger folk (i'm 30).  Otherwise, personally, Hollywood is destroying the english-language with is profanity-laced films.  Message to Hollywood:  If you wonder why people are going less to the theaters,  watch your filthy lauguage and clean up your act. Hey, I'm a liberal male, and a socialist to boot - but by using the F word everytime you want to MAKE A POINT,  it not only shows how uneducated you are, but how shallow your vocabulary is.  Get educated! Read a dictionary for God's sake and maybe you actually can produce a film where you can teach younger folks that profanity is not always the answer. Daniel J. Tyer,  WJG",0,0

R1LNTVGFO9VMXI,"If you are following along with the NIV you will feel this production is accurate, BUT if you are following along with the King James, you may very well find some distortion from scripture in this film. Keep in mind that the actors are for the most part Hollywood liberals, and that the translation of the NIV was headed up by Dr. Marten Woudstra, a gay man who led the old testament translation and Dr. Virginia Mollenkott, an avowed lesbian, who led the new testament translation. You won't find the word ""sodomite"" anywhere in that BOOK and ""repentance"" has been left out of most scriptures. Homosexuality is not condemned in the NIV as a sin, except in cases of male prostitution or forced sex acts and ""repentance"" is treated as if non-necessary to a Christian life. There are many other things that are different as well from one version to the other. There is a HUGE difference between the King James and the NIV Versions of the Bible and thus I would suggest using extreme caution when viewing anything based on the NIV. If you read the new version I would urge you to research these two people and the origins of the NIV liberal translation of the word of God.If that doesn't bother you then you need not be concerned about it, but if you hold to the text of the King James Bible, it is imperative that you know this film is based on the NIV, NOT THE KING JAMES! The other reviews posted here do not reflect this information and I think it is important for those who adhere to the original meaning of the Bible that this film like many others are modern interpretations and should be viewed as such. I'm not telling you that you shouldn't watch this film. Use your own discretion. It is simply my intent to give a review based on the King James version as almost all the other reviews deal explicitly with the other interpretation. It's only fair that the other side is also shared for those to whom it applies.",0,0
R3DKGJBT3KD06,"I almost never write bad reviews, but these are the worst pants I have ever purchased. I read the full Q&A and multiple positive and negative reviews before purchasing these pants. Unfortunately, the negative reviews are on-point. Problem #1 was the fit and sizing. Erring on the side of caution knowing sizes often run small from sellers such as this, I took the advice of other customers and purchased 2 sizes up in order to have a loose, comfortable fit. This was not the case. The waistband is useless and too lengthy. It has no tension or strength, and droops after only a short time of wear. There is not enough actual pant at the waist. The length of the pant leg was actually great (I am 6’ tall), but the fit was tight in the hip area initially and quite loose everywhere else. (Very odd fit, and I likely would not have been able to wear them at all had I purchased a smaller size.) That leads to problem #2. The fabric was exceptionally weak around the crotch area. I wore the pants to work (office job, nothing strenuous) and after approximately 3.5 hours of wear, the fabric had ripped open in the crotch area and the fabric continued to rip further horizontally across the rear throughout the day, and not even on a seam! It was as if the fabric was practically disintegrating and shredding!

In my opinion it is way to early in her career to have a ""greatest hits album"". Yes, I know shes been around for a few years...longer than most people expected, but she only has four albums, two of which weren't very good...Britney is a classic case of star that doesn't care what they do to their career so she has to get a greatest hits album out now before things goo to bad and everyone forgets about the mommy to be that had a select few years in the spotlight.

R1XGCPWRKKBKKA,"I am not quite sure what is happening with this series. Up until now, it was mostly a fun cozy reader that involved cats that could speak, that would help solve murder mysteries in a small town on the coast of California. With the last few novels, the series has veered dangerously away from that at times by introducing the third speaking cat, and focusing more on the human interactions than on any kind of a mystery. This book continues that trend and takes it to the extrement where there is almost no mystery of any kind among the humans, but the population of cats who can speak explodes to a gang of almost 20!OK, Ok. Every novel has some element of unbelievable fantasy to it. But, enough already! We can suspend our disbelief for a bit and somehow conceive two cats who can speak and due to their catlike agility and size, they can get in to spots that no human can and investigate crimes with no interference, as well as find ways to become snitches for the police force with the police having no idea what's going on.But ... to add a third cat to the mix? Adding a 'clowder' of 14 more? Having three or four humans knowing about their special abilities? How about ten or twenty more humans? You see why I believe this is getting out of hand?Unfortunately, the other part was severly lacking in this volume. Where is the mystery? Almost from the first chapter onwards, we know exactly what is going on. The gang of jewel thieves and their accomplices and hangers-on are not hidden at all, nor are their activities beyond suspicion. We find out right away who the thieves are, what they have done and are planning on doing, and following their trail as they plan their nefarious deeds. In the last quarter of the book we find out about a vaguely mysterious happening in Los Angeles that affected one of the prime people involved, but this is such a side story and of so little importance, that it was obviously an afterthought.So, what is the vast majority of this book concerned with? The gang of cats that Kit used to run with, is back in the area and the gang of robbers somehow knows about their special abilities. In fact, they have trapped four of the cats from this clowder - including the leader who is later said to have warned everyone of the specific kind of trap that is being used! Huh? If he knew all about this special trap, how come he falls right into one? Also, if he is in the trap, how does he manage to kill one of the gang members? And why did the other three members of this clowder get caught in those same kind of trap? None of this makes sense.Of course the village cats find out about this and manage to figure out who is involved, and how to get them out - eventually. First, though, Joe Grey gets into a fight with one human, and while he manages to shred this man in satisfying fashion, another man comes in, plucks Joe off the first man, puts Joe in the cage, and manages to do all this while Dulcie is also involved. Needless to say, Joe and Dulcie are furious, but man number two is not harmed or injured in any way!!! Have you ever tried to fight with one cat, let alone two???There are many more such episodes all around this book. None of them make the least bit of sense. The only reason I did not give this book a single star is that I really like the premise and the previous volumes were very good so I am hoping this is a single aberration and that Murphy goes back to writing these as mysteries.Final word: On the cover we see the statement: ""Action-filled ... An intriguing whodunit."" Nope. No whodunit at all, and relatively little action. Yuk.",0,0
R16T10RKVLXCXH,"I enjoyed reading other works by Bill Bryson, and as someone who has had a chance to drive many parts of back-roads America on business, I had higher hopes for this book, and wanted to enjoy it.  But as noted by other reviewers, Bryson comes off in this work as a curmudgeon rather than a humorist.  His attitude comes off as that of a ""conservative's"" pejorative stereotypes of an elitist, stuck-up ""liberal"" far too good for the likes of Wal-Mart, Gatlinburg, tourist attractions, buses, motels, fast food, and the like.  What others may find rural wilderness, he calls ""bleak,"" ""depressing,"" and ""lonely.""  I have been to many of the locales Bryson visited, many at roughly the same time as his 1980s tour (Beaufort, Bloomsburg, Mackinaw City, etc.), and I came away with much different impressions of the same places he describes--most likely because I actually interacted with an area and its occupants as an equal, not passing through hastily as a ""foreigner"" even though I have a bit of an accent.  My cynical impression is that those who find Bryson's travelogue humorous to the point of laugh-out-loud share a similar disdain for ""flyover country"" and its occupants, whereas those who live, work with, and even enjoy ""America's heartland"" will find this book disconcerting or depressing at best and insulting or offensive at worst.  Worse, the feel of the book is that of someone setting off to tour the country just to write a book about it, not of someone taking a trip to see the country for its own sake.",0,0

RR8OMQE313N0P,"This book was written with some mastery of the English language, and I would have given the book a three star had it been original.  The plot was copied almost exactly from Star Wars.  Think about it for a second.  It starts with a Rebel convoy being destroyed by an Imperial interception, but the Princess ejects the item that the Imperial taskforce was seeking.  Now, if this wasn't in a review of a fantasy book, wouldn't this have sounded exactly like the beginning of Star Wars.  Then, a young boy from a farming town  finds the item in a field, and eventually his home is destroyed by Imperial forces, and his parents killed.  Again, exactly like Star Wars.  Then, a mysterious hermit agrees to teach him the ancient arts of a dead order of protectors.  Jedi, anybody?  Eventually, he dies in the process of saving the Princess.  Killed by Darth Vader, no doubt.  Then Luke, I mean Eragon, is joined by a Han Solo figure.  It just goes on like this for the entire book; a clear and obvious parody of Star Wars.  In the end, the evil mage is killed, and we recieve some insight into how he was once a good little boy, but possessed by evil spirits.  Exactly like Vader!  This is just stupid, and disgusting.  Even some of the names of places in this books are from Tolkien.  Eragon, sounds a lot like Aragorn, doesn't it? Then, the lake Isenstar.  IsenGARD becomes a lake after it's destroyed in Lord of the Rings.  Then, the super-orc things sent by the evil emporer sound a lot like the Uruk-hai from Tolkien.  Once again, practically copied from Tolkien.  And then, there is the corny humor and names, like ""Saphira"".  Ugggh.  I give it a 2 only because it's kind of impressive that a 17 year old published this long of a book, even if the entire thing is a blatant copy of prominent works in science-fiction and fantasy.

R1XSUNBHPX3RR1,"I can't believe I wasted my time watching another one of these ""epic style"" movies... after Troy I should have known they were milking it for all it was worth. Actually truth be told I'm a big fan of epic style movies, but unfortunately as of late they've been getting less and less creative and more and more boring. This movie was perhaps the worst epic-style movie I've seen in a long time.Beside from the acting performances being lower than 1 star (sorry Jake G, I love you and your sister but you were horrible in this movie), the special effects (what a movie like this should be mainly about) were terrible! I remember hearing people scream out in the movie, ""Oh those wolves look real!"" I almost died laughing... sure the scene stopped my heart for a second, but the special effects were REALLY bad... I found it suprising only because it was so sudden.Beside from the special effects the music and storyline were terrible (did this film have music? Actually I don't remember, I guess it was nothing too memorable). The storyline was awful beyond belief.Just an all around bad movie. No offense to those of you who did like it, but I've noticed it is a growing trend for non sci-fi fans to latch onto movies like this for cheap thrills. If this is the type of person you are and the type of films you like, perhaps you'd like to check this title out... it sure is action packed.

R3G01B0IX0SF7C,"Even the most ardent fan of Kevin Smith's films would have to be a little disappointed with his latest offering, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back. While tying up (and in) with a few loose ends from his previous films, Smith's latest seems to lack any other purpose. Granted, Jay and Silent Bob are probably the most base of all Smith's characters, and being that they were the stars of this film we should expect the film's humour to reflect that baseness. But the jokes lacked the humour and creativity we have previously seen spout from the mouths of Jay and Silent Bob. The script lacked the intelligence of Smith's other films, and combined with a multitude of laboured cameos, flat dialogue, wasted action sequences (even the most jaded Star Wars fan could have put Mark Hamil to better use) and repetitive camera stares, the audience was treated to two hours of blandness. Not at all what we have come to expect from Kevin Smith.One has to wonder how a film that involves the likes of Kevin Smith as writer, along with actors such as Ben Afflek, Matt Damon, Chris Rock, Jason Lee and so on, could be so undeniably average. Perhaps it was with the intent of trying to bring closure to his previous films that Smith lost sight of providing a new and individual film for his audience.The characters of Jay and Silent Bob deserved a far better swan song than what Smith has provided here. Perhaps the DVD will offer some insight into why the final cut of the film was so listless. But special features aside, this film does not seem worthy of sitting alongside your copies of Clerks, Mallrats, Chasing Amy and Dogma.",0,0

R3DZL05IA5XQFA,"Although my rating for this is 2 stars - one of my lowest ratings ever for a DVD - I'm going to be up front with you, be honest and say:  This movie MAY be right up your alley.  It really depends on how willing you are to overlook a story that could have been written by a high school prom committee that suddenly found themselves in possession of several cameras and 50 million dollars worth of special effects.You've HEARD (or read) the plot outline, right?  New Ice Age comes and covers most of the Northern Hemisphere and a handful of smart/brave Americans save..... well, they don't save all of the Northern Hemisphere, but they at least save themselves.Dennis Quaid is a good and reliable actor, and in some roles I can readily accept him.  As an almost-washed-up Texas High School Baseball coach I buy it.  As one of the ""Cutters"" in ""Breaking Away"", he was powerful and brooding.  In ""Day"" he plays basically the genius scientist who predicts disaster but those dummies in the government don't believe him.  Not only was it hard for me to believe him in this role - I kept telling myself that it is a pretty weak ""save the world"" movie that essentially uses a weatherman as it's hero.Ian Holm is absolutely fantastic and totally believable as an ally weatherman over in Britain, but Sir Ian's screen time is minimal and his character disappears before the 2nd act, never to be heard from again.The ""star"" of the movie, of course, are the special effects, and they LOOK good.  But while I'm watching a guilty-pleasure extended sequence where a whole herd of tornadoes waltz through Los Angeles I was thinking....""just HOW was it that global warming causing disturbances in the polar ice cap and North Atlantic caused tornadoes in Southern California?""I'd buy ""El Nino"" or the recent string of Hurricanes through Florida first.The ""fun"" parts of this movie could have been condensed into a 15 minute special effects extravaganza and left out the absolutely ludicrous and impossible stories about our heroes and their impossible survival through a cold front so cold that earlier in the movie 3 British Helicopters are frozen in mid-air and crash - just from the cold.  To emphasize how cold it is one of the crewmen starts clawing his way out of the downed chopper, before freezing solid beginning at the tip of his nose.Our little band of characters, the ones we KNOW are going to ""make it"" not only live through that wave of cold air - but there are scenes where we see them running ahead of the freeze.... in sort of the same way teenagers flee from Jason in the Friday 13th movies.So.... if you want to see a lot of North America wiped out by bad weather - you've come to the RIGHT movie.

I don't expect a lot of reality to historical romances, but seriously this one was more fantasy than 50 Shades of Grey!

Bad idea.Jay and Silent Bob were like the pickle with your pastrami sandwich.  It's a really enjoyable part of the meal.  But what happens when you make an entire meal out of nothing but pickles?  There, in a cellophane wrapper, is what you have with J&SBSB.  I laughed maybe three times during the entire movie, mostly at Will Ferrell (who plays a clueless Forest Service agent).  Jay and Silent Bob were absolutely unfunny.  The romantic line (Jay falling for a beautiful jewel thief) is utterly unbelievable, and the diaglogue completely unfunny.  I enjoy good cussing as much as the next guy, but you will enjoy this movie only if random cussing and guys telling people other guys are gay, by themselves, are riotously funny.

There are thousands!"".Without doubt the idea behind the Spin is novel, well designed and awe-inspiring. Umfortunately, the effort to embed this idea into human drama has failed spectacularly (at last for me), both because of the dismal storytelling as well as the clumsy handling of the personell.Instead of being filled with wonder (which the idea behind the Spin would allow), I had the impression that SPIN was written by a ten year old boy, who has a good overview of currently discussed science and technology but has no grasp on language, no idea of a narrative development and does not yet has had first hand experience on how the world actually works and adult people interact (in society, business and romance). Nevertheless, the boy sits down and writes a 450 page novel followed by another two.You can see my problem ? Experience has taught me that as soon as I find myself holding a minority opinion it is advisable to re-check my assumptions. So, most likely it is me who rides on the wrong side. Especially, since SPIN appears to have received a Hugo Award.Well, I have reread spin twice now, but whilst the Spin-aspects seem more and more impeccable, the parts related to human interaction, religion and governance to me are still inconsumable and appear ever more pointless. Could it be that a HUGO is based on the idea behind a story only and does not take into account any literary aspects ?Minor SPOILER:The view of the author on mankinds' ability to survive as a civilisation seems to be bleaker than the one from Iain M. Banks. The latter seems to think that without external interference the survival rate of civilisations is rather small, whilst Robert C. Wilson rates it simply at zero.

However it seem clear that with each Scarpetta novel, Patricia Cornwell gets more and more long-winded with all the associated information and forgets she is writing a mystery/thriller novel.  It's not just her fault - many authours so this with recurring characters.Having read all the Scarpetta novels, I took my time getting to this one.  My wife said it was not worth reading and I should have taken her word for that.  But I did delay.  I wish I had delayed longer.Not only is the ending the worst I've read in a very long time but things happen in the novel that just don't make sense:*Lucy murders Rocco.  That's justifiable since he's bad.  Nothing self defense about this.  Then afterward wonders if murdering him was right considering she did confirm the details that were in the one short letter she recieved - that might or might not have come from who she thought it was.  (Turns out it didn't come from him.)  And then, almost the first chance she has, she admits it to her lawyer.  ANd then minutes later to Kay.  Hello...  you murdered someone.  You don't go blabbing about it.*For better or for worse, Rocco is Marino's son.  You'd think that would count for at least some double checking.*Marino is going downhill fast.  I was hoping he'd double over with a heart attack as it appears he might be at one point.  In this novel he has no redeaming features nor any appreciable skills.  In fact I don't think he does anything useful in this novel.*Benton comes back.  Many reviews try to avoid saying this but he's back on page 50 so it's not a big secret.  He cold bloodly plans and murders three people.  To say nothing of the fact that he's set up his friends to also do illegal acts including murder.*The ending is just so bad.  We have pages of character development/discussion about Bev and Jay Talley but her death comes in a few paragraphs and we have nothing on his end but a one-sentence description.  There was more space given to describing Lucy's helicopter than to the logical endings in this book.  Hell we have 4-5 pages of Marion walking out on Trixie and 2-3 pages of Kay and Benton reunion.*The single worst point in the book is Chapter 46 when Lucy and Rudy are driving away from the murder and Lucy starts to ""deeply kisses his fingers, his knuckles, his palm...and slides the other inside her black linen blouse...""  I kept reading expecting to find out that we had dopplegangers or something.  But no...there's a passing reference to things you do as a release from such harrowing experiences but this example makes no sense.  It'd be like James Bond feeling up his male contact after his latest murder.  We all know Cornwell was married for 10 years prior to realizing she was Lesbian but we have no history of this with Lucy.  Lucy's been Lesbian since almost the first - this behaviour makes absolutely no sense.So this is the last Scarpetta novel I'll buy.  I might read the next one if I can get it from the library but it has to be much better for me to even finish it.Hopefully the next novel will wrap up any loose ends and the Scarpetta characters put to a rest.  Then maybe in 10 years Cornwell can come back fresh and with a novel to rival her first ones.",0,0
RLO25BIRSILQW,"I had read very good reviews about this book however it fell short of the brilliance i was expecting, both from a literary value and from a storyline point of view. We are presented with two University students who are more self-absorbed in their own politically and socially righteous beliefs that they forget to be human - which in turn leads to self harm due to the stubbornness of expressing feelings because it's a sign of weakness for one of them, and ruining relationships and other people's feelings for social self gratification for the other one. And then there is the married couple facing a plethora of issues and feeding off of the positive influence that these two students have on their own relationship, mental health and happiness, unwilling to face up to the shortcomings of their marriage and happily and selfishly enjoying a revival of their bond off the back of someone else's sacrifice and misery. I found that none of the characters are relatable or even likeable. Numerous aspects are difficult to accept as being realistic - i doubt there are many wives out there who would accept their husbands having an affair with a younger woman and then casually invite her to dinner. In short, this book somehow manages to make self harm, introversion to the point of social and emotional shut down, superficial relationships, multiple relationships at the same time and publicly known extra-marital affairs seem acceptable. I wholeheartedly disagree.",0,0

It seemed like there was quite a bit of air or empty space in both tubes. Which would explain why I went through the tubes so quickly. One tube didn't last a month and I was the only one using it and used a dime sized amount each time. Most toothpastes last a lot longer.

R3D1ZMHDNPIZM0,"Here's the problem with this item.  I purchased it based upon the stellar reviews (4.5 stars with 1968+ total reviews).  It turns out all those reviews are actually for the original book (and not for this graphic novel).  The two should not be listed with the same reviews.  This graphic novel is not that good.  It's written for teenagers and really doesn't fully grasp the theme of ""Duality"" that the book does.  The art is fine, but not very inspired.  The lettering looks like a Word document.  And ultimately the story is more talk than action anyways.  I wouldn't have bought it, if it had average reviews of 2 or 3 stars which it deserves.",0,0

I had a look at the other reviews this morning as I was finding the book a real struggle and wondered what others thought. Glad I did as I've now decided not to waste any more of my life reading this drivel as it evidently doesn't get any better!The prose is clunky, the characters contrived and unsympathetic and the whole plot seems overblown and melodramatic rather than chilling. I knew it was game over really when Ash ""gasped in apprehension"" at the sight of the castle. I mean seriously? When did you last gasp in an apprehensive manner?!

R3OCRU1VMRUJX8,"I've been reading James Patterson's books for years (I don't think I've missed one!) and we all know that a majority of his books these days are ghost-written by a co-author, meaning that the quality isn't often anywhere near as good as some of his earlier novels (such as the Alex Cross ones). Well Private is a prime example of this - sloppy writing with forced dialogue, predictable plot twists and celebrity name-drops and product placements litter nearly each one of the short chapters; bad two dimensional characters that are all horribly unlikable; and three unrelated ""mysteries"" that tie up a little too easily (and are then forgotten about - I mean, what was the point of the NFL storyline exactly?!) and have none of the usual twists and shocks that I'd expect from a thriller novel.I just wish Patterson would do himself a favour and stop putting his name on any book thrown at him as his reputation is going to be dragged through the mud even more with books like this one. This is the last time that I get excited about one of his novels and pre-order it so I get it on day of release and I'll read a few other customer reviews before purchasing in future as this was a real waste of time and money.",0,0
R3TNDTKHPJ9LX1,"When I saw that Tina was set to tour again, my hope was that there would be a new album of songs. My fear was that Capitol would do yet another greatest hits CD. That's what we got here. It's good for the 2 new songs, I'M READY , which rocks, and IT WOULD BE A CRIME, which is good too. As for the other added bonus type tracks not on any other Tina CD, there are 2 nicely rearranged live in concert versions from 1999 of LET'S STAY TOGETHER and I CAN'T STAND THE RAIN that are a pleasant surprise to hear this way. And lo and behold, they dug up a real rarity, the soundtrack version from the film "" TOMMY "" of Tina's version of THE ACID QUEEN, which is something new to have on a Tina hits CD [ and a different version than on her "" ACID QUEEN "" 1975 solo album ]. But overall, I wish that this was a RARITIES release. What's the point with dragging up the hits yet again? It was done just a couple years ago with the far superior ALL THE BEST, then the one disc ALL THE BEST-THE HITS. And don't forget her best-selling SIMPLY THE BEST from 1991, the McDonalds promotion CD , GREATEST HITS from 1994, and the box set SIXTIES TO NINETIES. Geez, the greatest hits have been done to death! And still ONE OF THE LIVING from "" MAD MAX BEYOND THUNDERDOME "" has not made any of these greatest hits CD's. It charted at #15, the video was shown all over the place, and yet it's only on the soundtrack CD, and the scarce promotional 1993 Tina hits compilation PLAY THIS IN STORE. Tina must really hate ONE OF THE LIVING as it has not been on any CD since it's original release. Too bad, as it's a great recording that won her a Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance, Female. I would have loved a RARITIES CD, and it would have collected the many non-LP tracks, B-sides, and soundtrack songs. Here's what I would have loved to have seen : THE GAME OF LOVE [ with Santana ], TAKE ME TO THE RIVER, HAVIN' A PARTY, STRONGER THAN THE WIND, BOLD AND RECKLESS, HE LIVES IN YOU, BABY I'M A STAR, LOVE IS A BEAUTIFUL THING, DO SOMETHING, SHAKE A TAIL FEATHER, TINA'S WISH, BREAK EVERY RULE [ Single Remix ], and AFTERGLOW [ Remix ]. Such a selection of songs would have been new to many people, and would have collected all of these odds and ends into a really nice collection. If we couldn't have had a whole new album of songs, that would have been the next best thing. Oh well, just my view that's it's the hits yet again, with 2 new songs, and a few rarities. This could have been a much better CD with more research and some ideas than recycling the hits again. I read that Tina's set list for the new tour basically follows the order of the tracks on this CD. So, it's like a "" souvenir "" of the concert.",0,0
R1BPK2119PY41H,"I shy away from Oprah picks and wish I had done so with this novel, the first by this novelist who doesn't come close to so many writers who also came from the Iowa Writers' Workshop. The language is stale and much of what is written about is trite, territory that has already been covered and more skillfully by other writers. Of course there had to be a homosexual black man, but a totally unrealistic one, one who also has a lot of sex with women. Yes, dealing with the issues of homosexual black men with their internalized homophobia is a topic deserving a place in literature, but this writer doesn't really know her subject matter. I am not black, but I am gay. And that character just doesn't ring true. Nor, for example, does his brother Six, the preacher kid.The novel--if it really could be called a novel since it is really a series of short piece of fiction about the same family--the same ""tribe""--is essentially plotless. That, of course, is not necessarily a reason to find it weak. But low-plot novels have to be compensated for with strong character development. And that isn't what you will get in this novel. These are actually more like short stories than chapters--something Elizabeth Strout did so well in her Pulitzer-winning ""Olive Kitteridge""--with the same cast of Hattie and her family but without any real sense of direction toward a whole.And then there are the many factual errors which I found annoying such as ""hooking a braided rug,"" suggesting that Mr. Mathis wrote this without doing the research a writer must do if the reader is to be captured by the novel's verisimilitude. Where was an editor in the process? one wonders.The opening story may be the best one although I really didn't believe it. In other words this writer doesn't seem to know her subject matter, has apparently studied Toni Morrison but never found her own voice.I should give it a one star, but I won't.",0,0

RHWO7FMOQP1ZN,"The first third of this book is so engaging and interesting that I was ready to recommend it enthusiastically.  Unfortunately, the plot just doesn't make any progress from there.  Even the lightest of airplane or beach reads has to deliver some payoff to the reader.  The last two-thirds of Six Years is not only not fun to read, but but it is just plain irritating.  Sure, you get some of the same witty banter and observations that make the Myron Bolitar series (of which I am a big fan) so popular.  The plot, however, is so full of holes that you wish the protagonist would just hurry up and get himself killed, as he appears to be dead set on doing.Jake, the hero of this book, is, to put it politely, a dimwit.  If you enjoy reading a ""mystery"" in which the stumbling protagonist is always five or six steps behind the reader, this book is for you.  It takes Jake the entire length of this book to gather information the basic outlines of which you, the intelligent reader, has figured out in the first third of the novel.  When he finally fills in the details, they don't add significantly to this basic outline.  Along the way, there are many preposterous twists and turn that just don't stand up to scrutiny.  Sometimes the bad guys are geniuses who turn up out of nowhere.  Sometimes they fail to look for Jake in the most obvious places, giving him time to investigate without any pressure.  In particular, the book's ending depends on a mysterious appearance that the author never even tries to explain.Basically, Jake keeps stumbling into the same boring kind of situation over and over, without ever putting two and two together.  Likewise, his constant rhapsodizing over his lost love is so sappy and repetitious that it makes you think that Coben was trying to write a Harlequin romance without any real clue about how to do so.Based on the number of five-star reviews, it is clear that many readers found this book thrilling and engrossing.  I can only conclude that these readers are either as slow-witted as Jake, or they have a great deal of patience for books in which nothing much happens, and that which does happen doesn't make much sense.",0,0

R1OCJC9GZJ548E,"**Updating my review after more months of use: This specific model is terrible. It's been a few months and each time I use it (maybe once a month) it makes my hair terribly brittle and breaks apart, something that at first use it didn't seem to do. It barely heats (still) and is overall a cheap piece of garbage. If you want a good quality hair result, this won't be the one for you. I took my review from three stars to one. It's that crappy.** This brand came highly recommended by my hairstylists over the years, so I went for it with the lower-cost model as a test drive of sorts. It gets the job done & one BIG PLUS is that my hair does not feel dry, brittle, & dead at the ends. I only use flat irons for beach wave style curls, so it does well enough in that regard, but it isn't perfect. Even at the highest heat setting it feels like it barely heats so the look I have gone for with this flat iron isn't achieved entirely, which is frustrating (hence the three stars). I've only had this for a month, so naturally I've got some time to play around with it and figure it out. It hasn't been a total waste of money, so we'll see how it goes.

R1K3DFOIBX2TRX,"Being a typical horse-loving 10 year old girl (way, way back in the day..), it almost goes without saying that of course I read Black Beauty by Anna Sewell. The story of the gentle black horse in Victorian England is simple and perfect. It's a true classic for kids, proven over several generations that have grown up reading it just as I did. With this in mind, I went looking to buy a copy at a bookstore yesterday as a birthday present for a 10 year old young lady.Now as far as I know, kids today are no less intelligent, and they do still teach them to read starting in Kindergarten. So imagine my horror at discovering that the attractively bound, hardback of Black Beauty that I picked up was, uh, *paraphrased*  (actually there are more accurate terms for it, but for the sake of the Amazon censors I'd better stick to the less graphic ones). Comparing selections of this version side by side with the original, the so-called ""Classic Starts"" Black Beauty plot is stripped down; worse, the lovely language of the original has been replaced with, ahem, simplified text and dialog that could have been written by the author of the Judy Moody books. This left little sense of the turn of the century England setting, and completely obliterated the spirit and style of Anna Sewell. Is this the publisher's idea of a quality introduction to children's lit?What I really want to know is, why change it at all?  As I said, kids today aren't less smart, they should be able to read the real Black Beauty well enough by the time they are in the 9-12 suggested age range. The reason it's a classic is because IT WORKED JUST AS IT WAS. Sorry, I had to put that in large type for the publishers, who evidently believe that the rest of the population matches their literary fluency.I hope other parents who are planning on purchasing this and other classics for their kids will catch the difference between the CS paraphrased/heavily edited/oh what the heck, dumbed down versions and the real books.  Apparently the School Library Journal agrees with me on this, if you care to read their review above the customer reviews on the product page.-Andrea, aka Merribelle",0,0
RYKJTHRJQN8O3,"Are you kidding me? This is a book of 252 pages of text. But it is actually an essay-length study. The publisher has used every possible means to make it book-length. There are a total of 39 photos and maps in the book. They are useful. But they each take up a numbered page, reducing the text to 213 pages. Each chapter has a title page, the back of which is blank. There are eight chapters and an introduction, so this uses up 18 more numbered pages, reducing the text to 195 pages. The first page of text for each chapter begins halfway down the page, reducing the number of pages to 191. The margins of each page of text are expanded on the left and right, and at the top and bottom. The space between each line is wider than the average book. This means that two pages of text in this book would fit on one page in a normal book. This reduces the book to about 86 pages.This might not be so bad if these 86 pages contained some meat, but they do not. They ARE well written. James McPherson is an excellent writer. This is one of his great strengths as a historian. But the book offers very little analysis, and McPherson refuses to compare Davis to Abraham Lincoln, his counterpart. It taught me absolutely nothing that I didn't already know. It is mostly just a narrative of some of the problems Davis faced as president of the Confederate States of America. The book is a blatant effort to cash in on McPherson's good reputation. The retail price of $32.95 for this book borders on the obscene.Check out my other reviews and you will see I am a very liberal reviewer. But this is ridiculous.",0,0
R13NAOBT94B0LZ,"I really wanted to like this game. Like many reviewers, I'm a Dark Souls fan eager for another fix. Unfortunately, this game isn't anywhere near Dark Souls in terms of quality. Dark Souls is meticulous in its design. Enemy encounters involve precision, care, quick thinking and composure. It rewards patience and perseverance. Everything in the world of Dark Souls, from the brilliant level design, to the lore and gameplay mechanics, is created with a guided and methodical intent. It's what makes Dark Souls so remarkable. The difficulty that gets so much attention is ancillary.That's what Lords of the Fallen and it's developers didn't understand. They created a game that emulates the difficulty of Dark Souls, to a degree, and the gameplay mechanics, but none of the meticulous design, thought and intent is present.The combat is clunky, unbalanced with an awful camera that frequently leaves you blind, especially during boss encounters (Worshipper I'm looking at you), the level design is bland and generic, and the world is lifeless.

RENYVXD76SHCA,"I absolutely loath and hate the fact that I must write this review of a James Herbert book and it's one that I never thought I would have to give.I have loved almost all of his books since he started publishing them. There have been a couple recently that one instantly read and threw away but never one so bad and dud as this.I often wonder if authors should keep resurrecting a character especially if they have been through as much as Ash has in two previous books. Maybe best to let them lie and get the reader wondering. This is definitely the case with this book.I initially got interested in the first few pages and then started to drift and then started to scan, something I have never done with  a Herbert novel before. I wonder if his proof reader did likewise as there are so many mistakes in it that belies the fact that this novel's publishing date kept being put back. Is Delphine a doctor or a psychologist or a psychiatrist? When does a revolver suddenly turn into an automatic? How could Gaddafi be there when the whole world saw him being slayed by his people?Aside from that why bring back rats? Cringingly why on earth does he bring his own  persona into the story with Ash saying 'I hate that bloke who wrote about rats'. At least when Clive Cussler writes himself into a story it is done with some panache and actually adds in some little way to the story. I just thought...oh God whatever next!I had waited and waited like so many other fans, for this book, looking forward to being able to sit down and enjoy a thoroughly tried and tested read. Oh how I was wrong.Sorry James but I feel cheated and sad and also sad for you. This is definitely not nor will ever be a piece of writing that you can be proud of or even want to add your name too. Shame on your publishers for not throwing it back and asking you to cut out at least 50% of it along with half the storyline, the politics, the medical goo that is often incorrect and misleading (as others have pointed out in these reviews ).What saddens me most is wondering if you do write another book, will I bother to read it?I hate to say it but is it time to hang up your pen or go sit somewhere quiet and re read The Fog or the Rats or Survivor or Others, and remember when you were great and actually wrote brilliant novels.",0,0

Of course, Maximus had to be the adult, white male, accepting of all other colors, creeds, and genders (and he loves those innocent little kids). Good stuff, for today to be sure, but that's what makes this movie fiction and not historical fiction. It's odd that this happy, feel good concept is juxtaposed to a dark, gloomy back drop and morose faces on characters. Scott was clearly trying really hard to say something, maybe even something important, which makes this bad movie all the more embarassing.",0,0
R31HVO1TEGVH26,"Though I am a prolific reader, I rarely take the time to write an online review. This book was so bad that I could not hold back.  The plotline was wholly unbelievable. The characters were left in nascent stages of development by the conclusion of this novel. A love story developed out of three instances of questionable contact.  The female lead was willing to make life-altering decisions on this minimal contact and without any obvious reason for trust.  In short, this story left me cold and incredulously shaking my head.",0,0

R3QP70JPVNM1WN,"Madeline Hunter can really write, but this book was one of her less enjoyable efforts.  I liked the fact that she tackled a war that is rarely mentioned in romance novels.  The history provided is accurate without overwhelming the story.  Those attributes made the story worth 2 stars to me.  The characters and the repetitive ideas concerning the romance between them were disappointing.The main couple consists of an English Lord and the daughter of a former Welsh leader.  Marcus is in the service of King Edward, holding lands in the conquered territory of Wales. Nesta is a Welsh loyalist. The story takes place during one of the Welsh rebellions against England.  This could have been a great tale.  Unfortunately I couldn't really love either character.  Marcus was weak and gullible, constantly risking being destroyed by Edward just to keep Nesta with him.  This would have been romantic if Nesta had been worth the risk.  Nothing about her was likable.  She ruthlessly risked her own neck and Marcus's by committing numerous acts of treason to help the Welsh rebellion.  He ran in circles trying to keep her from getting herself hung, meanwhile losing the respect of his peers and chancing forfeiture of his family's home, land, and status.  When he would open his heart to her, she would lose her temper and tell him there was no love between them.  The only time Marcus and Nesta were not fighting was when they were ""making love"".  (But don't dare call it ""love"" when speaking to Nesta...  she insists it is only ""lust"".)  The whole book repeated these themes over and over.  I could not see why Marcus would think she was worth the gamble, which made me see him as a total sap.Irritating characters , repetition, and no true romance... not a great combo.  Hunter's use of realistic events made it worth finishing the book, although many pages were skimmed through.",0,0
R22QCUPTVX9ZUK,"I guess this is what passes for academic history these days, where people are mere pawns of inexorable social phenomena. But what's most interesting about any history are the human dramas. South African history is littered with fascinating personalities and dramatic events. Van Riebeeck, Chaka, Dingane, Smith, Mlanjeni, Retief, Maritz, Jameson, Rhodes, Botha, the list of interesting personalities is endless. But they and the events they caused or experienced are but a vague background in this wordy tome. The people who drove events are ghosts rating a word or a paragraph, with no personality at all. The climactic battle of Blood River merits less than a paragraph (it's not even listed in the index). The author mentions a few people (Cecil Rhodes arrives in Africa and in a paragraph he's suddenly Prime Minister) and an event or two, then launches into yet another lengthy discussion of racial and class divisions.  The fraught racial and social context are by no means a mystery to anyone even remotely familiar with South Africa, but they are endlessly elaborated and repeated here, consuming at least a third of the text. After the the 5th repetition, let alone the 23rd, I got the point. Those issues are critical to understanding South Africa, but jeez, gimme a break, will ya? In the end, the author makes the fascinating, convoluted history of a storied nation simply . . . boring. I was sorely disappointed. Now searching for something better.",0,0

R2BUP0CUO8026I,"This review contains spoilers... However, if they prevent you from watching the film, consider that a good thing. You'd be better off if I just told you how it ended and saved you two hours of your life.A horrible sense of disillusion dawned on me as I watched this third installment in the oversized Matrix trilogy. Suddenly I realized how trite and unoriginal the pseudo-philosophical concepts that guided the story were. These are the same concepts that the first two movies in the series followed, but this time it's much more obvious than ever before. The first film in the series, while not as original in conception as it seemed to me back then, had sparks of uniqueness and originality like few other movies - perhaps not in its concept but certainly in its writing, styling, and cinematography. The second one, while it didn't have that same spark, still managed to be satisfactory by incorporating several action scenes of immense originality and uniqueness in their styling and visualization. This third film doesn't even have that. I won't go against sequels and trilogies in general, because classics like Star Wars and The Godfather, not to mention more modern examples like Lord of the Rings and Kill Bill, could have never reached their full depth in only one film, but a filmmaker shouldn't have to do three films when he said all he had to say in the first one.First, we have an impressive but rather pointless fight sequence in the Merovingian's bar. It might have been fitting for an opener if the rest of the film was more impressive. The mythological and theological hints in that scene are so obvious and overwhelming (the club is hell, the Merovingian is Hades, the Trainman is the Ferryman), yet they lead nowhere. Much more coherent were the creepy sadism-masochism not-so-subtle hints; but whether that was meant to have some meaning, or just to satisfy Larry Wachowski's odd passions, I don't know. The character of Seraph - `The Wingless Angel' - seems to be building towards something, but reaches no conclusion. This is one of many openings the trilogy leaves that make me fear a spin-off, an animated series or perhaps awful second-rate books written by fanboys like the ones Star Trek got. The scene in the train station is probably the best part of the movie, and I liked the low-key, minimal production feel of it. It got dwarfed, however, next to the laughs I got from the scene in which Trinity and Morpheus meet the Oracle - Mary Alice. The Wachowskis were at a loss as to how deal with the death of actress Gloria Foster, and did less than well in the ridiculous solution they came up with. I think I would have liked it better if the Oracle became a thin, young, blonde woman; that would at least show some guts.The battle for Zion was of course impressive, but to me it seemed like little more than a big screen computer game. The whole thing was badly unconvincing, especially those MACH style Starship Troopers rip-off robots the rebels use. And since the directors created in me absolutely zero emotional connection to either Zion or any of the people in it (were we supposed to become emotionally attached to Zion after that horrible orgy/rave scene in the second movie? If so, badly done) I simply didn't care about the outcome. An important part of good sci-fi writing is, since the viewer obviously has no empathy for the characters or places beforehand, to make him care about them. Matrix Revolutions didn't do that. Zee, Link, Lock and all of these half-baked characters introduced to us in the second film are uninteresting and unimportant. That entire battle was too long and very dull.As for the other big showdown - the battle between Neo and Smith... Neo already battled with Smith in the first and second movie, and both of these scenes were original and impressive. The duel in the first movie was wonderfully directed and choreographed, while the battle between Neo and the multiple Smiths in The Matrix Reloaded was original and exciting. This final battle is none of the above; it's dull, predictable and unimpressive, using every cliché imaginable. It consists mainly of Smith knocking Neo down and Neo getting up again, over and over. And let's not even discuss Trinity's horrible, oversized, melodramatic and pathetic death scene which would have made Wagner blush.Another thing I realized watching this movie is that the only character in the entire trilogy that I really cared for, that really had a personality and characterization, was Agent Smith. Hugo Weaving is, I now realize, a fantastic actor, and he created a truly timeless and unique character. I also loved his real-world incarnation as Bane; I could see it was Smith long before he gave himself away with that `Mr. Anderson' remark. Could you possibly have recognized Neo or Trinity had they stumbled into another body? Smith is the only major creation which made the expansion of the series somewhat worthwhile. Morpheus was an interesting character in the first movie, but I could never forgive him after that horrible, hilarious speech he gave in Zion in the beginning of part 2. As for Neo, he was never very interesting since he became the One - I liked him better when he was a confused, clueless hacker. Despite any enjoyment I got from the second movie, the series would probably have been better off ending there.",0,0

R3NPFK9NVU0QCO,"I love this genre of writing. Compared to other books in this genre, this one in particular goes way out in left field of realism. Realism to me is a key factor. If you do not care about how realistic characters reactions or outcomes in combat scenarios are, then you will like it. The story line is good, but what the main character does and is able to survive is just plain rediculous. A former military guy, not SF by any means as stated in the book, becomes a security contractor. Okay, believable. The same man going to civilian training classes and now being able to operate at an SF level? NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. Having broken ribs that never heal fully then getting shot, bleeding put to the point of dying and miraculously recovering fully w/ no problem? Rediculous. Engaging in combat multiple times against highly trained enemy combatants while being extremely outnumbered and ALWAYS coming out on top? REDICULOUS. Always hitting his targets in the heat of battle?? REDICULOUS. I gave the book 2 stars because the story line is okay, but the realism is just does not exist at all.

R5V6KWX53RDDK,"Yea, I know I'm not part of the intended audience for this book; for some curious reason they don't make books for men on this topic... Anyway, I can't give high marks to any book about men and marriage which doesn't start with the very fundamental fact that marriage confers no rights on men, only obligations.  What this implies is that a woman looking for a husband is basically looking for a chump.  Curiously, Molloy is close to discovering this crucial bit of information: he relates an anecdote about a woman who call a man an idiot (really) the first time they meet, and of course they then proceed in a short while on to happily-ever-after status.  To paraphrase Groucho Marx, I wouldn't want to have anything to do with any woman who would want me to be her husband.Alone that was enough to drop the book down to 2-3 star level, but the real clincher was the episode of domestic violence (pgs 127-8) related in another anecdote which Molloy describes as ""hysterical"", as in ""outrageously funny"".  I cannot sanction such glib treatment of such a serious topic and therefore recommend people who think similarly shun this book entirely.  This episode occurs in a context where a woman is pressuring a man into marriage, and if you loosely equate such emotional pressure used against a man with the physical pressure a man might use against a woman to get sex, well you get the picture.Besides those two fatal flaws, Molloy is pulling the ... that by interviewing people coming out of marriage license application bureaus that he is somehow able to elucidate their (especially the woman's) ""Secrets"".  But this is an illusion: since 85-90% of the population marries at some point you might as well do a general survey, with all the attendant problems with self-reporting and self-deception that anthropologists and sociologists are well aware of (and are ignored here).  The women with fresh marriage licenses have just gotten lucky, i.e., their turn has come up and it's not like they necessarily know anything other single women don't.  (In other words, part of the marketing for this book is based on women's jealousy; perhaps this is why there's a picture of a diamond ring on the cover rather that some generic hubby...)  What it boils down to is that a lot of what Molloy comes up with, and announces as if he's just come down from the mountain with The Truth, is largely spurious.  The book is entirely self-referential: he doesn't compare or contrast his ""findings"" with the work of others, as if he were the first to look into this topic.  Right.  This causes him to get several things exactly backward, such are the ""discovery"" that men want to marry up, which is actually a result of female strategies and ""selection effects"".What's not spurious is generally rather obvious, or just plain wrong IMO.  Like other books in this extensive genre, the whole thing is a mix of truth, half-truth, and the downright ridiculous (like going around with a book on your head and rolled up washclothes on each shoulder - to improve your posture.)  Molloy does come across as being something really old-fashioned out of the 1950's -- he's always women's champion.  Only a very traditional (and fairly naive) woman *might* find something useful here, though how one would separate the valuable material from the [not valuble] I don't know.  Due to space limitations I've only touched on a few of the many things wrong w/this book - my critique could easily be several times longer.",0,0

R14GPRYYO8FO1R,"There is something very important the reader must know about Ilium before embarking on its journey: the book is not a stand alone book.  Rather, it's one story split into two books: Ilium and Olympos, and Ilium ends on a dramatic cliffhanger that resolves nothing. Why you should care about this is because the sequel, Olympos, is an awful book.  As in it's really, really bad - badly written, unlikable characters, whole chapters about nothing, and manages to be both boring and confusing at the same time. I honestly think the Olympos was ghost written by someone else paid to do the job, because the change in style when one reads straight though from Ilium into Olympos is extremely jarring. It doesn't seem like the same author.All of this is quite a shame because Ilium was a book I couldn't put down. It had brilliant ideas, was mostly well written, had interesting characters, plenty of mystery, and was basically the opposite of what Olympos ended up as. But since the story is effectively one story, and neither book stands on it's own, I feel the whole thing is tainted and I cannot recommend Ilium to others.I'm sure not many people will notice this little review, but it's the review I wish I saw before purchasing the book.",0,0
R13HDJNU2K3RYO,"Not Sure... I received this as a gift, which I asked for due to the good reviews.I just starting making sourdough a few months ago, have a starter in my fridge- which I made from a dehydrated starter and now maintain.  I have not made a recipe from the book yet because I am hugely intimated after just leafing through the recipes.  I cooked and baked all of my life (40+years) have a scale and can measure in grams, etc.  So I'm not a novice.And I've made other sourdough recipes using my starter and they've turned out great.I guess I should have used the feature to look through the book ahead of time instead of just going by reviews.I really don't understand her concept of so many grams of 100% hydration starter, etc... I printed off various recipes from multiple sources that use basic sourdough starter, not this percent hydration starter deal.This book seems too overcomplicated in even just the basic bread recipes and to just overcomplicate everything else as well.  Its baking. I want to bake something great and eat it. I don't want to have to spend so much time and effort with a method or ingredient.  Life is too short and there are many other recipes and books out there!  There are desserts and such that don't even seem to be of a sourdough variety so I'm not sure why they are in there.All in all, I wish I would have made a different selection in books, and hope then I can find a way to use this one (using the starter I already have) otherwise its going to go the way of the resale. Unfortunately.Its a visually appealing book I will give it that.  That bumps it up a star. Otherwise it would have give it one right now as the recipes are useless to me until I actually sit down and try to figure out how I can convert my starter to use.  :((((",0,0

Some of the actions the main character takes don't really seem like they would be in character for a true prepper, but I guess that could be debatable. The other characters in this book are a bit of a joke. You have the token giants that are strong of body but slow of mind, the beautiful woman that are somehow taken with these simple,  slow witted but stronger than a bull men, and  the token weak child that the main character takes in to protect. Oh and don't forget the various male characters doing things that are physically impossible, like one arming a person into the air by his throat, which, if even possible would probably require extensive strong man training and biceps as big around as my waist. Then there was Abigail.

R1BH5J85GVQN3D,"I am only a hundred or so pages into this wretched book, and I really don't know if I have the heart to go on...if I do, then I'll write a part 2 to this review. If I can be bothered.I bought this book thinking that it would be a wonderful, serious, well-written historical novel. Ha! Boy, was I suckered! This isn't a serious book - it's a romance novel, of the Harlequin/Mills and Boon variety (though not even a very good one), trying to masquerade as real literature. But at least romance books usually have the decency to stop at a few hundred pages long, whereas this book goes on for almost seven hundred LENGTHY pages. Ugh! I don't know why the author made it so long-winded. She really shouldn't have. It's painfully full of filler and unnecessary stuff. I myself can sum up the first hundred pages a lot more briefly and effectively:Evil wanton mother: ""Daughter, I am cruel like a stereotypical Disney cartoon villainess, and I say, you must marry Roger.""Spineless, insipidly dull but virtuous daughter: ""Oh goody! I love Roger! I can't wait.""They go to London. Although witless daughter knows that her family have fallen on hard times, she is surprised to find she is forced to live in the kind of dingy little abode you live in when you've fallen on hard times. Still, she doesn't complain, because she's a doormat who never says anything, except about how much she loves Roger, of course. Repeatedly.Handsome and impossibly perfect hero, Roger, enters. He says ""I'll marry her because she looks just like her grandfather.""Silly heroine swoons.Relatives complain about the dowry.And that's pretty much it.I wasn't kidding about the grandpa thing. The hero actually says to the heroine,""God save me, Barbara, but you are the very image of your grandfather!"" And the heroine takes it as the NICEST compliment she's ever received, and proof that Roger is a kind man who likes her. Argh! If some guy told me I looked like my grandpa, I DEFINITELY wouldn't take it as a compliment - I'd assume he was insulting me by telling me I looked like an elderly MAN! That, or I'd worry that he fancied my grandpa.The dialogue in this book is inane. But at least its gaffs are mildly amusing at times, albeit unintentionally. Not so the shallowness, and sometimes extreme nastiness, of the writer in the way she describes her characters. In true romance book style, EVERY character's physical appearance is described in great detail, and their looks assessed and rated, as if how physically beautiful they are - or aren't - is a guide to their worthiness as a person. The hero is of course impossibly good looking, not to mention rich and fashionable and beloved by ALL, and his good looks are mentioned CONSTANTLY, over and over and over again, page after page. It's like being hit with a beautiful sledgehammer. I wanted to yell at the author, ""Okay, I get it, he's handsome, there's no need to keep going on about it. Can you not find something else to say about him? Something INTERESTING perhaps? Some character trait other than just him looking good?"" The hero was so perfect, so utterly flawless in his physical appearance, that I just couldn't believe he was a real human being, so the story around him seemed unrealistic too. The heroine, also, was naturally a physically attractive character (grandpa comments aside), though thankfully her looks were rarely mentioned, unlike the hero's. But apart from those two, the only other attractive character is the mother, and only because it was necessary for her to be, since she was cast in the stereotypical part of the wanton villainess who enjoys seducing men. (Why is it that in so many of these clicheed stories, the heroine is virtuous and good, but the villainess is the kind of woman who'll sleep with a number of men - what a cliche, as if women who sleep around are always bad! So old fashioned!)The pious, virtuous grandmother of the heroine is not mentioned as pretty, but at least she's not much maligned. The author is reasonably kind, for once, but again falls into the trap of seeming to imply that a woman must be virtuous (not to mention God-fearing) to be a good person.The other characters in this book, outside of the four I just mentioned, are described as fat, or old, or ugly, or a combination of the three, and the author absolutely RIDICULES them for their physical imperfections, going on and on and on about it. And naturally, these not-so-pretty characters are always stupid and mean and greedy, because we all know that if you're not beautiful on the outside, you're not beautiful on the inside, right? The overweight maid Clemmie, especially, is ridiculed at every opportunity, her weight constantly made fun of, her looks derided, and the author has written her as a stupid, clumsy character, one that the prettier characters laugh at (seemingly with the author's approval). Many, many parts of the book also deride the elderly characters, talking about their wrinkles, and how silly the characters look and behave and think, and how they shouldn't be dressing in 'younger fashions', and how much fatter and uglier they've become with age.Argh! I was repulsed! It was so mean and shallow and beauty-obsessed, as if only pretty people are worth something.The only halfway interesting minor character was a gay man who's a friend of Roger's. But even he seems like a charicature, a stereotype, flamboyant and gossipy and b*tchy and openly promiscuous, with no real depth or substance or life outside of his role in the hero's life. I thought he seemed more like what people in the eighties who didn't actually know any gay people might think a gay man from San Francisco would be like, based on what they'd seen on tv comedy skits, rather than what a gay man a few centuries ago would actually have been like. I am almost tempted to keep reading the book to see if his character is going to be further developed. But I sense that things aren't going to improve for this character, and may just get worse. He's probably only there to spread some gossip or something.But anyway, back onto the subject of shallowness, I got sick of reading every character's appearance being picked apart, like a corpse by a vulture. It was like reading one of those cruel celebrity gossip magazines that are full of articles about which star has put on, or lost, a few pounds, and in which all the celebrities are constantly scrutinised for every little flaw in their appearances. If you like those kinds of magazines, or if you're the type of person who likes to criticise the way that people around you look (presumably because you look so perfect yourself) then you'll probably like this book. It'll probably help if you're also the kind of person who loves romance books and those really trashy, barely-believeable soap operas that are screened during the day on tv. However, if you're a lover of intelligent, witty, well-written or truly entertaining literature, and if you're not totally hung up on personal appearances, and bad cliches make you cringe, perhaps you might do better to bypass this book and look for a better one. Also, I don't think guys are going to like this book. But hey, I may be wrong. Guys can be really unpredictable. And that's the way I like them. I like that guys are interesting and mysterious and individual, with more to them than just IMPOSSIBLY PERFECT LOOKS!",0,0

R1H6XHXVS803WR,"I first read this book after a bunch of hype in Middle school and rather liked it. The thing that bothered me about this book was that is was a bit ""over-seasoned,"" and it seemed like Paolini was full of himself. Anybody who gives this book such high shining praise needs to take a second look. I do take note that a lot of reviewers who gave this book five stars have read many other fantasy  books, and if they enjoyed it, its fine...But for thoughs who have NOT read a large collection of fantasy series need to set this series down and leave it alone to expand their horizons. This series (which are now four books in total) is a pure rip-off. Its your typical sugar-sweet package of ""good-against-evil,"" with Star Wars, Dragonriders of Pern and the Lord of the Rings mixed in, along with Paolini's own little twist. It makes me a bit angry that he so boldly took these elements and tried to create a masterpiece, which was a good effort, but not a winner in my opinion.Paolini has a lot of imagination and I praise him for that. But the way how he goes into detail, his choice of grammar and his little ""language,"" going on just doesn't cut-it. Its quite obvious at first read that this was written by a teenager, and not an adult with a bunch of experience backing him/her up. Whoever praises Eragon as the greatest fantasy author on the face of the planet is naive, and apparently hadn't read other great works of fantasy and or green to the genre.There are so many other books out there that are greater than Eragon, (such as my personal favorite The Symphony of Ages by Elizabeth Haydon) so if you are looking for another good series to read and take my advice, try something like The Lost Journals of Ven Polypheme, or at least some Dragonlance. For thoughs of you over the age of 13, try reading the SOA series or even some McCaffrey. Don't just stick with Paolini.",0,0
RMIYUG305XQXK,"I bought these for my Samsung galaxy j3 emerge. The charger cord the phone came with was fraying and the inside wires were visible. Only after 6mos. I was thrilled to find these as they seemed solid, had good reviews and to get 4 cords, (2-6ft and 2-3 ft) was a killer deal for my needs. They arrived quickly as usual and they truly are solid. The cord is such a tight/durable braid. I've never seen a cord like this. I can't possibly see how they could ever break, fray, strip etc. They all fit my phone perfectly with a tight hold. They pretty much had a nice snap in the sound and feel to them when plugging into the phone. The charge is alot faster than my old cord also. Honestly, they are so much better than the original one that came with the phone. I highly recommend these cords.Update: My previous review was given too soon. Less than a month from receiving these cords the first 6ft cable became too loose. The cable will not flex/bend enough therefore the cable port has moved around in the female port of my phone too much. I was hoping it was just that cord. The next 6ft cord is doing the same thing as I type. At first they seem durable and able to withstand any kind of movement..That is the problem. They're TOO durable. They don't bend at all therefore the connection to the usb port on your phone will no longer have the ability to take any charger for the cable cord's inability to flex at all pulls at the connection. Dont buy these cable cords. They will destroy and strip the female port of your phone. I'm sure this company will not replace your phone and no cable cords will work after the damage is done. The stiffer the cable cord is not a good thing. In the future I'll stick to good old fashioned cords that are way more flexible.",0,0
R3D00HRPOMGZO4,"I hate writing negative reviews on Amazon.  I especially hate writing a negative review about a product that I know somebody put a lot of time and energy into (plus I know how hard writing something interesting can be).  Adding to my frustration here is the fact I like Mick Foley the entertainer - he is a wrestler who has given me countless great memories in the ring and he truly seems like a nice guy who is devoted to his family.  That being said, this book fails to recapture the magic his first two autobiographies had and, even worse, was torture to finish.The basic premise of The Hardcore Diaries is a good one.  Mick Foley came up with a wrestling angle (storyline) and this book was to be written in diary fashion documenting Mick's thoughts as the angle played out in the WWE.  I believe this could make for an exceptionally compelling read for wrestling and non-wrestling fans a like, if done right.  Especially when being written by a brilliant man who is a very gifted writer.  There is a major problem right away though - the storyline only takes about 6 weeks from start to finish.  Even with production meetings before each show, there is only so much Foley can write about.  Compounding the issue, Foley wasn't traveling day-to-day with the WWE at this point so his ""backstage"" stories are going to be limited.  To fill 300 pages or so, filler is going to be needed (in this case, lots and lots and lots and lots of filler).So we get pages upon pages dedicated to Mick's family, meeting Katie Couric, rubber chicken dinners, visiting sick children and veterans, softball and little league games, church, etc...  Making matters even worse is the fact that it's not even in diary fashion - we start jumping years at a time.  By about the midway point I couldn't even remember the stupid angle this book was supposed to be about in the first place.  By the end, I was seriously telling myself that the book is going in the ""later"" pile if he tells one more story about visiting a veteran's hospital.  It's really hard to completely blame Mick here though - there is just not enough meat on the bone with this one wrestling storyline to fill-up an entire book and we already have two other books on Foley, so his fresh stories are going to be very limited.That's not to say this book doesn't have its pluses.  When he does concentrate on the ""here-and-now"" entries it is a very good read.  His proposed wrestling storyline gets changed so much by the WWE, and to read about his frustrations to this is interesting and really adds a human element to him.  Even when he is talking about the family in these parts things don't seem so contrived since the events are happening in ""real time"" so to speak.Overall, this book is only a must buy for die-hard Foley fans who want to know everything about him.  Causal fans of the guy or non-wrestling fans should pick-up his first two autobiographies - those are great reads.",0,0

Although the film boasts a strong cast of likable stars, their performances aren't enough to overcome its uneven pacing, corniness, uninteresting subplots (like the babysitter one), lulls in inspired humor, and forced plot twists.

R2BA5Q5IEXE864,"I did not finish this book. I got annoyed and disappointed of it in several ways and decided not to waste any more time on it. In fact it kept me away from reading for a few days, as I was just so reluctant to look further into it.It starts out in an interesting way, also the main character of the first part is an interesting person who helps to move the story forward.But then comes part two and again, as in e.g. The Songs of Distant Earth (here even more than there), Clarke completely loses the epic tale to boring, pedantic and completely distracting descriptions of soap-like characters and their interactions. I had to put away the book several times, as I could not read on.From the perspective of a reader in 2018, this part (written in 1953) seems like a sciFi comedy, written in the 50s. But it is obvious, that it is not meant as a comedy. Clarke describes a (then) futuristic cocktail party. He follows a couple around the house they are invited to and describes his vision of the future by describing what they see and talk.  He got mostly everything wrong - none of his visions became true. But that is ok, it's sort of sweet to see how imagination got partially overtaken by human achievements.Where he is correct is the invention of the pill and DNA-tests - which in his mind would completely change and free society. This is just one of the examples where Clarke's visions show his blind believe in technology, that every new development would make humankind better. His unreflected predictions are shockingly naive. He does not at all tell us that new developments in society usually come with new challenges and problems.But then he starts going into spiritual issues, a seance takes place and obviously something important happens. That's (for any given time) just plain ridiculous. But still ok, in his foreword Clarke apologizes for his believes in spiritual mambo jumbo in the 50s.He also tries in a kind of helpless way to let at least one woman play a more important role in the book, maybe that was something outstanding in the 50's, but I don't really think so. Others have described strong female characters before, just look at the women in Raymond Chandlers books. Clarke's female character stays plain, boring and is, besides that, constantly criticized by her male friend/husband, who seems completely stuck in the post-WW-II age. I mean: Clarke was not able to assume that even male characters would change to the better.In a similar helpless way he tries to say ""all men and women are equal, regardless of their race"" and fails also here. He tries to emphasize equality by over-stressing the racial differences which were overcome. And therefore this nothing more than a horrible account of the prejudices of that age.It was not possible for me to go on reading this book. I cannot understand, how this book could get such a high rating.",0,0
R228HIDHKB05YP,"It's so difficult to review this novel, given that I believe in the author and her intentions, however if *this* is George Sand, I'd rather slit my wrists than read her books; Venal, selfish, petty...  this is what comes of too much research, letters and journals and not enough reading.

R22K32L4KFF9YB,"Enjoyed Normal People the novel, and really enjoyed the 12 part TV adaption. It left me wondering what other books would benefit from a 12 part adaption rather than a straight to movie effort. Anyway after recently reading that the actress who is playing Melissa in the TV adaption of Conversations WF was less than complimentary about the source material I thought she was being mean and kind of rude. So I read it - and my god what over hyped nonsense this book is. I will forgive because its a debut novel, but Im amazed about the hype this book generated. The prose is odd, naval gazing and full of over egged poetic analogy where anything the protagonist does is akin to something else. ALL THE TIME. ‘I peeled my wet clothes off like skin from a wound’ - everything she says is like something else. She is supposed to be a poet but all I was getting from this supposed writer was Rik the Peoples Poet from the Young Ones. And as other low star reviewers have said, all the main characters are flat and boring. I didn’t care about ANY of them. Who wants to read about a bunch of people who have their own heads so severely up their own arses? There is no wit, no pathos, just bland anaemic narcissism of all involved and a weird acute fixation on wealth and the middle class. I rarely write reviews but honestly, this one was so confusing in the face of the hype its gratifying to find Im not alone in wondering how the hell this is now going to be a tv series.",0,0

RQVKOA5N6X1B9,"NOTE: I did not finish Fury of Fire. I reached page 207, out of 412, before I called it quits. My review reflects on what I read and no more, which is more than enough to be indicative to how the author creates her book.During the course of reading, everyone comes across a book that just doesn't connect with them. That doesn't mean the book is bad or that others shouldn't read it, it just means the it isn't a good fit that particular person. This is that book for me. I had a very difficult time getting through what I read, mostly due to a bunch of little things that stood out and were what I consider oddities, especially in context to situations in the book. If I had to describe this book in one word, it'd be abrasive. The characters, the dialogue, and most importantly, the writing felt like rubbing sandpaper over a wound. Over and over again.THE BADThe constant bombardment of internalizing that both Myst and Bastian provide in this book was like a splinter under my fingernail. The more I dug, the more painful it became, and I started to dislike the book and main characters more and more as I read on. Admittedly, it was pretty easy to loathe Bastian and Myst when it became apparent that they are both boring and stupid, and I didn't find Bastian all that likeable in the first place. Call me crazy, but I just feel uneasy when a character wants to immediately jump the bones of a person he just met in horrific situation while she is frightened beyond belief. But apparently that's okay because he acknowledges his creepiness in a fit of mental self-flagellation. Sorry, but that doesn't fly with me. Maybe if that had been mentioned only once, I would have let it slide, but it keeps on like that for way too long. Apparently he's all alpha on the outside and emo on the inside. What a winning combination! Not. Myst herself starts off, uh, decent enough but then quickly becomes the nitwit I was hoping to avoid. She gets the fastest case of Stockholm Syndrome I've ever come across. For all intents and purposes, Bastian kidnapped her. Sure, we the readers know it's for Myst and the baby's safety from the evil Razorbacks, but she certainly doesn't know that, therefore I found her reactions extremely unrealistic and bizarre to the situations she was in. One minute she's fighting, and by fighting I mean being stubbornly spunky, or somewhat thinking of escape, the next she's imagining wild, hot monkey sex with Bastian. I'm sorry but if some big, six-foot-six (apparently every male is 6'6 in this book, even the human cop. Obviously, if a guy is under that height, he's not really a man.), scary dude who can turn into a dragon kidnaps me, I am so not going to be thinking about how hot they are or what they're like in the sack. Yeah, uh-huh, that makes perfect sense. Oy! Anyway, they end up making out that night due to Bastian's alpha going crazy and some supernatural roofie that dragons put out to females. God, this is not romantic at all. And it's only been a few hours since they ""met""! The morning after Myst is kidnapped, she wakes up naked and finds out Bastian bathed her, can you say mondo creepy? So after she dresses, she goes meandering through the Nightfury's lair, admiring his artwork and crap, then ends up in the kitchen with the rest of the freaky-tall Nightfuries. I'd be high-tailing it out of there, in fact, I would have been plotting escape long before this point. It appears she only thinks of escape once a day. While she's in the kitchen, Bastian has her sit at the table so she can eat her breakfast. He sets down a plate in front of her and as she goes to have a bite, she notices he cut her waffles into little, perfect, bite-size pieces and she's apparently overcome by this act. Can you say weird? All feminist angles aside, who cuts up someone else's food unless: A, it's for a small child, two, their arms and hands are broken, or D, they're handicapped in some way that prevents them from feeding themselves? W.T.F.? Frankly, I think it's just odd. And then she gets misty-eyed (Myst is all misty, how cute. *gag*) when he asks her to help name the baby he kidnapped. I've already doubted her sanity before but now it's gone to even more ridiculous heights by this point.The magical Rohypnol I mentioned before creeped me the heck out. So when a dragon guy needs his energy fix, he picks out a woman, roofies her, feeds off her energy, sleeps with her, and then wipes her memory! Say what? That's too close to rape for my liking. This wasn't just the bad guys doing this, but the next book's ""hero"" did that to a woman in a hospital (note: she wasn't a patient, I think she was a researcher or something, I don't remember). How sweet.The excessive swearing needed edited down. Normally I don't mind a little cursing here and there, but so much of it didn't need to be added to the dialogue or characters and showed a lack of creativity.The ""dragons"" are really shape-shifting vampires. They have to feed off women, only it's energy instead of blood, they can't be out in the sun, they heal quickly, live a long time, are super-strong, amongst other attributes. If you're going to have shape-shifting dragons, don't make them so similar to other paranormal species. Differentiate them so they're unique, not a near-clone.I didn't like the whole reading of minds thing. If it was something that happened when mated, fine, but I don't like the thought of someone just arbitrarily getting into someones else's brain whenever they want. It's a violation. Bastian did this to Myst way too often.The characters sound a lot like each other. They don't all have individual voices so there isn't much beyond a name separating one from the other.THE GOODThe first fight scene was actually quite well-done, although it was very early on in the book so it might not hold up on a second reading. The next fight scene wasn't too bad, maybe a little confusing at times.The other characters in the Dragonfury series have the potential to be more interesting if they can be given some individuality, but since I didn't connect with the author's writing style and don't like most of the ideas, I won't be looking for any sequels to this oh-so-romantic series. I wouldn't recommend this book, but hey, if it sounds right up your alley, by all means try it out for yourself.As a final note, I just wanted to thank Buzz McCallister for his mad counting/alphabetizing skillz in writing this review. I couldn't have done it without you.",0,0

R1WXH3GPO25WUD,"This book was one of those that really forces you to go back and change the star ratings of other bad books you’ve read. I’ve never been a fan of James Patterson’s puffed up novellas written for the half drunk, but man, at least those earlier novels made an attempt at some type of authenticity. Private doesn’t even attempt to be worth my time. If the first page had read: Chapter 1: You’ve been scammed sucker, I’d at least be forced to say, “touché, Private, you won that round.” Honestly, I’ve read more interesting cereal boxes. Hell, back in the day, sitting in near dark with milk droplets clinging to my lips, trying to navigate Toucan Sam through a maze to the fruit loop bowl – without a pencil – now that was drama! Twists, turns, even the occasionally path not taken. I wish I was kidding folks. You’re better off in the cereal aisle at Kroger than you are with this dreck in your hand.To play devil’s advocate with myself for a second, I understand that a quick simple read has a place in the world. I’m honestly a closet advocate of the quick simple read. I cranked through hundreds of Gold Eagle novels when I was in my tweens, and even read a handful of Harlequin romances to see what the fuss was about. These got the job done. They advertised themselves as bottom of the barrel entertainment, consumers looking for that purchased them, read them, were satisfied, and continued as needed. But let me tell you two big differences between those dime store novels for hire as compared to this James Patterson branded novel for hire by Maxine Paetro.  Private would have you believe it’s a real book. It isn’t. It’s a middle of the pack or worse novel for hire that was probably cranked out in a week or so. Don’t charge full hard cover price for this kind of stuff. It’s theft. Second: don’t insult my intelligence. Do some research. If you are going to toss reality completely out the window and sweep science and thinking under the rug, make some effort to hide the sleight of hand.Can I digress for a few moments here? This seems like a good place to talk about Amazon reviews. On one hand, I guess I have to allow that people have different opinions and may experience something totally differently from another person, fine, but even allowing for that, the number of five star reviews this book has is troubling. I’m not going to speculate as to the agenda, if any, of these readers, but I will say that the review system in place here has become so inundated with these promotors as to make it no longer a useful tool to readers like myself. Long gone are the days where one could reasonably assume that a book with a 4+ star average (!) rating wouldn’t at minimum make you feel you’d wasted your time and money. I’d like to modestly propose that Amazon give customers the ability to remove reviewers completely from their Amazon experience. Some might abuse this and just remove everyone and end up in a landscape of information identical to the current political climate, but they aren’t voting for a president, just the next book to read, so who cares. For me, all these folks that give every single book or movie 5 stars and throw in a review like ‘I liked it’ are immediate removals. They are masking what my experience might actually be. Same thing for people that love James Patterson and Dan Brown and think Tolstoy was a mindless hack. CUT. There’s nothing wrong with those people, I just don’t want to hear their opinions anymore. Maybe, after a year or two of removing people that either aren’t taking the review system seriously, or just simply have such radically different tastes from myself as to be completely alien, I can see an average score of 3 and make a reasonable assumption that at minimum I won’t find the title offensively bad and completely unprofessional. I know this won’t be the last terrible book I read, but please, give me the tools to reduce the quantity.",0,0

R3FVSE6DJ3BFBI,"I saw this movie first on the big screen I was pretty keen, soI guess I had very high expectations, Imagine how disappointed I wasto discover that this film was far from being the great movie I had desperately hoped it would be, the only other films to get my hopes so disappointingly high was BLAIR WITCH and ABSOLUTE BEGINNERS, although the Matrix is nowhere near as bad/rotten/stupid/or as pathetic as those movies are, (theyre in a class of their own).Their were a few good points that drew me to the movie, like the Special FX and the action scenes, the opening with Carrie Anne Moss and Hugo Weaving was simply brilliant, even though it looked very similar to certain scenes in BLADE actually quite alot of the action scenes seemed to be inspired by BLADE and THE CROW (I wonder why that is? If youve seen BLADE then you will know what I mean! ) Laurence Fishburne is always watchable though his scifi choices havent always been good, do you remember EVENT HORIZON?  I think his talent was wasted or perhaps he could have had a better co-star, not Keanu!Anyway because I liked some of it I decided to give the Matrix another chance, I got it out again on DVD, which is chock full of Extras that are pretty cool, I watched how the actors prepared for their more grueling scenes and began to appreciate the movie on a different level, getting more insight into how hard everyone worked to get this movie up on the big screen I guess it made me more sympathetic, even though I still cringe at Keanus performance, and roll my eyes at some corny scenes with Carrie saying lovey dovey words of encouragement to Neo, I have to say I disliked it less than when I watched it the first time, which is something I guess.I wont discourage anyone from watching it, go see it and find out for yourself make up your own mind, as for me Id rather buy BLADE much more entertaining. By the way did you know that the DVD version has some hidden extras (or 'Easter Eggs as theyre more commonly known, although technically this isnt a real 'Easter Egg') theyre not obviously advertised on the package see if you can find them!",0,0
R32ZRHZ3NUP4YB,"It really should have tipped me off when all the four and five star reviews rave about how much they love Kelly Ripa, but neglect to address the actual book.I cannot consider this a novel. It's a ""cozy"" mystery. I will try the next one, praying Kate White takes reader comments into consideration.I'm not summarizing the book, because if you want a summary, read the one Amazon provides.This book could be hard to stomach at many times, as it is really obvious that White has written Bailey to be a younger, cuter, sexier, and cooler version of herself (based on Bailey's physical description--check out a picture of White--not so hot, but very similar to Bailey) and based on White's idealized general lifestyle (high profile friends, glamorous events, and please tell me what freelancer writing one article a month has NO budget concerns?) Yet, Bailey doesn't come across as young, cute, cool, or sexy. We are simply told that she's ""so hip"" and attractive; none of Bailey's speech or actions reflect it. I was just waiting for Bailey to complain about her arthritis or osteoporosis. No 33 year old acts like Bailey! (And why is every cozy mystery heroine 33, anyway?) She seems frumpy and ugly and totally stupid when it comes to men. However, Bailey naturally attracts every man she meets, fending them off with her ""wit"" and disdain. Come on.Also, why does every cozy mystery heroine have insomnia? God, if I wanted to read, ""At 1:00 the sleeplessness took over, and I finally fell into a light sleep until 5am, only to wake again at 6:30..."" It's already unpleasant enough to not be able to sleep, so why does anyone want to read about it in great detail EVERY night Bailey goes to bed?The other characters were very hard to keep straight (or care about), as none were fleshed out beyond what they wore. Oh, but if a character is mean, rude, or unhelpful, that character is inevitably ugly. But good looking people are ALL cool and nice in the real world, right? (No.)ENDLESSLY describing transportation! This might substitute for the lack of description of Bailey's surroundings if one lives in or is intimately familiar with NYC, but I can't keep reading ""...I walked two blocks to the Lex at 86th...""; ""I realized that the bus would be fastest, and ran to the corner of 5th and Park as the #12 pulled up""; ""it took me 15 minutes to hail a cab going the wrong way""... Too much.And this brings me to the worst part of the book: White feels we need to know EVERY SINGLE LITTLE THING Bailey does. Readers will not think our books are missing chapters if we don't know what Bailey did from noon to 1:30. And everything she wears. Every time she showers or bathes, as well as the water pressure and what soaps Bailey used. Loooong passages in which nothing happens: daily minutia including absolutely nothing and no activity that figure in to the book later, yet we still must read that: ""I put on a navy cardigan [yes, 33 years old and a cardigan is her go-to look], Brown capri pants, and my jeanS jacket [you write a magazine! People call it a ""jean jacket""!] and took the elevator downstairs, where I said hello to Bob, the doorman on duty, and collected my mail. I put my mail in my purse and walked east on Broom where I caught the L line to the Gloss offices. I dropped my piece off in my boss's inbox, looked at the stylists' mannequin wearing a red plaid cape and nothing else, and spent 10 minutes looking at my emails as I charged my phone. I walked out past the coffee station. It had started to rain, so I hailed a cab on 1st, ignoring the family of five who seemed in desperate need of a ride. I returned to my apartment and checked my messages: one call from a telemarketer, two college friends in town who wanted to go out for drinks and Landon wondering if I wanted dinner at his place...""...Oops, almost forgot the food descriptions. Kill me. These aren't delicious descriptions that result in the urge to make decadent, buttery 5 course meals. Instead, they literally include Bailey telling us how she cut the mold off cheddar cheese... then made an omelette! Riveting! And then: what she and every other person orders at cafes, restaurants, or pubs, right down to their (inconsequential) beverage choices; what she scavengers from her one-night-stand's fridge; the butter lettuce in her fridge (then ""I washed my fork and bowl and put the lettuce back in my fridge...""). And I don't care that her fridge is in a constant state of emptiness. I just want to scream, ""Go to the damn store!!! Go buy something to eat if this is always an (again, inconsequential) detail. We get it, Bailey and her non-existent budget always eats out because everyone knows all freelance writers can do that. We get it. It's NYC.As a matter of fact, this book feels like Kate White is living vicariously through Bailey--cooler name, cooler clothes, cooler face, cooler experiences.

The sticks that come with the net aren't plastic as I have read in other reviews, they are metal.  This does not make them any easier to use or any more effective.  They need to be planted at least 12 inches into the ground reducing the actual length.  They are also completely unstable and the joke of a ""tether"" string they send is absolutely no help in stabilizing the posts.

R2C9Y54L9XWTS1,"I've read quite a few books on comic history - and I've yet to not finish one.  I only made it half-way through the unabridged Audible audiobook of this title before I returned it.  I'm not sure how it's reviewed so well, because I agree with the reviews on so many other books in the same genre, but this one was just awful.The narrator has a beautiful voice (think Sean Connery with an American accent) but in this case it didn't help as the material is so boring and repetitive it made it almost impossible to even pay attention to.  The book is so scattered and full of useless information I was often forgetting it was even about comic books.  If you want to hear about what kind of television or sound system William Gaines owned, and the details of how it worked - just maybe, this book is for you.It's repetitive story after repetitive story of some local municipality blaming a comic for bad (or criminal) behavior of some kid.  Since each story is essentially the same, and no new info is gleaned from repeating yet another instance of comics being used as a scapegoat, it seems just repetitive for the sake of padding out the book.  I picked up this up hoping to hear more about the Seduction of the Innocent scandal in the 50's, but I couldn't make it more than half-way through the book and found I didn't particularly care what the author would have to say about it, anyway.When comics themselves are actually mentioned, it's briefly - and often not even specifically.  Almost exclusively it's about exploitation/crime comics, very few mentions of more popular books folks may have actually heard of or made any impact - and when he does throw the occasional bone to one, it's often misinformed (the brief bit about the creator of Wonder Woman was not only pithy and dismissive, it drew a knee-jerk conclusion that flies in the face of the facts which even novice comic scholars would know).To top it all off, the text uses terribly racist terms in abundance.  It's one thing when giving a direct historical quote to use the word ""negro"", but the author uses it so freely in his own words that I was stunned.  I had to check the copyright date to see if this actually was a book written last century.  There was one point in chapter five where it was used literally ten times in about two minutes.  These were not quotes, but the authors own words - just because you are writing about a time period when the word was acceptable, that does not mean it's acceptable to use the words to describe it unless, again, they all come from direct quotes to support the text.As I said, I have read quite a few historical books about comics, many longer (and better) than this mess, so it wasn't beyond my capability to understand - I simply didn't care about endless details about William Gaines or painstakingly talking about every single instance in American history where someone blamed a comic book for some kid misbehaving.  Instead of trying to make a book with a broader appeal, the author seems like he would have been better served by cutting the text in half and just presenting a biography of William Gaines.",0,0

R3NXJXJA8T51FM,"The Chairman's Rating: 2/10This movie is Sanctimonious Tripe!Just when you hoped that Matrix: Reloaded was a fluke, you find out that it wasn't.  It was the original Matrix that was the fluke.This movie is the poster child for the 'WCS' award (Would'a, Could'a, Should'a).  No, correct that.  This one earns a special WCS Lifetime Achievement Award.Everything that made 'The Matrix' the phenomenon it was (such that I use the reference Pre-Matrix and Post-Matrix when describing special effects or sci-fi thereafter) was missing from this movie.  Everything important, everything meaningful to the true Matrix storyline was either glossed over or run together in horribly placed soliloquies, as if to say, 'Get the storyline over with so we can get back to spending all of our $ on the special effects, Maaaan' (spoken with 70's hippie drawl)  To me, using special effects in film is akin to matching perfect wine (special effects) with the right food (storyline) .  The food (storyline) must come first and is the most important.  If the wine (special effects) is overbearing,  the entire experience falls flat.  The Wachowski brothers had two paths to go down after The Matrix: 1) true sci-fi storyline and a mind expanding plot, spiced with special effects; or 2) special effects to impress the 13 year-old kids to buy lots of stuff.  The chose the latter, and the viewers have suffered the consequences.The few pieces of good storyline were totally overshadowed.  However, kudos to an admirable job by Mary Alice as the Oracle.  With the loss of Gloria Foster, Ms. Alice was given a tough role and given no script with which to work, she managed to pull it off.With the exception of Neo, anyone really doing anything was non-white, female or both.  The true beauty/genius of The Matrix was that you never noticed race or gender.  The characters were written so well and performed so brilliantly by the cast that it made no difference at all.  I loved it and was hoping for lots more of the same in future releases, in essence eliminating stereotypes.  In Revolutions, the politically-correct stereotypes were jammed in the viewers faces constantly.There were more cliches in this movie than sentinels. In the 'finest' Independence Day tradition: Tough, old grizzledMarine yelling at the 16-year old kid, the 'Give 'em hell' speech, the kid 'saves the day', 2 chicks dishin' (rockets, thatis), Jada Pinkett ScreenKiller calling everything 'Baby'.  Jogging instead of running, while trying to escape pursuers?  C'mon, fake the running, at least, but jogging with flattened hands doesn't make anyone appear to be running faster.And after seeing the inhabitants of Zion, all I did was arm-chair General and root for the machines.  I think the sentinels should have been outfitted with white gloves at the end of their tentacles, just so they could 'dope-slap' everyone in Zion.With the choir music and doe-eyes at the mention of the name 'Neo', you can tell that they were hoping to start a belief system akin to the Jedi Knights of Star Wars, thereby propagating the series into lot$ of $ale$.To top it all off, the 'Features' in the 2-CD set:Links to Web sites (to $ell $tuff)Matrix Comics (to $ell $tuff)Matrix Tunnel Game (to $ell $tuff)(BTW, the Matrix: Reloaded PC Game was rated by many as one of the worst games released in 2003.)For an example of the reverse, take Tomb Raider.  Tomb Raider was a popular video game long before the movies came out.  So when the movies arrived, everyone knew to pretty much check your brain at the door, sit back and be entertained.  Both movies succeeded and were hits because we knew roughly what to expect.  Not so with The Matrix.  It was PRECISELY the LBI (Left the Brains In) Factor that so intrigued everyone in the first place.  To remove that intellectual aspect entirely was a total shock and much more of a letdown than if it were mindless to begin withThere is SO much wrong with this film that almost every scene deserves its own paragraph explaining the absurdity of ever putting it to film.The horrid music pretending to be awe-inspiringCastrated MorpheusJada Pinket ScreenKillerZion Council of Sanctimonious Do-NothingsOne line sums it up.  Agent Smith, after taking over the matrix and turning it dark, green and rainy, and turning all the people into replicas of himself, asks Neo: `So, how do you like what I've done with the place?'  Frankly, I loved it!Just like Independence Day, this movie was Chinese food for the eyes, i.e. five minutes after watching it, you're hungry.  In fact, minutes after watching it, I was so ticked off that I immediately watched the first 35 minutes of 'Saving Private Ryan'.  I had to flush this Matrix: REVULSIONS out of my mind and to do it I chose to watch people REALLY fighting, for the RIGHT reasons, for people WORTH saving.Let's face it, Cypher was right all along. 'Why, oh why, didn't I take the BLUE pill?'  After the first Matrix, I ask myself (and the Wachowski brothers) the same thing.",0,0
R347246JIJ7DDE,"One should be sceptical of any book that requires a title and two sub-titles. Whether or not one is a member of the church founded by Joseph Smith, he is a singular and important person in the development of America and its organic life today. A book of apologetic encouragement to accept Joseph Smith's account of his life and experiences would be of little or no use to someone evaluating his assertions and the legitimacy of the impact of this extra-ordinary man. Equally unhelpful is a book, such as the amazingly perenial psycho-biography by Faun Browdy--whose deficiencies as a biographer were laid bare in her attempt on the life of Thomas Jefferson, about whom enough was generally known to enable an easy condemnation of it. A proper biography requires that an author take his or her subject seriously, and as the subject presents himself or herself to the world. Joseph Smith, unique among the founders of a religion in 19th Century America, presented himself as a prophet of God. He made clear and unqualified statements that he had, on more than one occasion, seen and conversed with Jesus Christ and an impressive list of angelic messengers; and who received revelations, now published, from them. He also produced a book (The Book of Mormon, best reviewed in Tyrrel Givens' ""By The Hand of Mormon"", Oxford Press) which he did not claim to have written either by himself or under inspiration. Instead, he asserted without qualification that the book was written by ancient prophets about real people, doing real things, at real places, in a distantly ancient world; and that his only contribution was to translate it by God-given instruments. Joseph Smith's presentation of himself is thus either that of a fraud, a prophet, or a pious or delusional fraud. Bushman's book errs in not discharging the fundamental obligation of a biographer to present his subject's importance based upon the subject's life work; adding historical and other contextual information to render the life in three dimensions. Bushman asserts apparently that he is a follower of, and believer in, Joseph Smith's declarations, suggesting an apologetic proselyting tool. The book is anything but that. Instead, Bushman compromises Joseph Smith as he compromises himself: a man who propounds what on the face of it may be implausable; but palatable enough to not be dismissed out of hand as a crook or a crank.This accounts for Bushman's need for two subtitles. The actual title, Joseph Smith, is of course what one would expect of a biography, although it is sparse. The first subtitle is not necessarily enlightening: ""Rough Stone Rolling"". That subtitle is either incomprehensible or misleading to potential readers of the book who do not know what it really means. Although not presented as a quotation, it actually is a phrase lifted from a longer statement attributed to Joseph Smith, which, if I have not got it exactly right, is along the lines of: ""I was a rough stone rolling, until the Lord took me in hand"".The full sense of the statement, and many others made by Joseph Smith, was the improbability of his assertion that he was a prophet of God, and a frank admission of his insight into his own foibles. The uninitiated will thus not easily understand that the title and first emendation mean: Joseph Smith, who although asserting he was a prophet, was insightful and candid in stating that the assertion was improbable in general, and as applied to him in particular. So far, one is only at the cover, and is at best unelightened and a worst confused about the pivitol issue in any written life of Joseph Smith.The larger problem with the book, and the clearest indication of its failure as a biography, is the second subtitle: ""A cultural biography of Mormonism's founder."" If that is what the book is, then it as irrelevant as ""A culural biography of Albert Einstein"", or ""A cultural biography of Beethoven"". The centrality of each of those lives, scientific genius, and compositional genius, would be displaced by an attempt to explain the work of either of them in cultural terms. Of course it is interesting to know that Einstein was Jewish, that he once worked in a patent office, and that he left Europe as a result of Nazi anti-semitism, but none of that contributes in any way to an exploration of the sources, genius, and impact of Einstein's work. One does not evaluate the brilliance of either of his theories of relativity by knowing of his ethnic background, that he was a victim of persecution, or his love life; because they do nothing at all to explain it and by trying to make them do so, his contribution to the world is trivialized. Those are the settings for the diamond; they do not assist us as we marvel at the brilliance to the stone that came from the mind of this mild and unassuming man. The culture in which Beethoven lived does through light on why he composed ""classical"" music (a tautology if ever there were one) instead of acid rock, or rap; but it does not help us grasp how this musical genious was able to produce works that will doubtless live and be loved forever. If someone's life is worth a biography, it should help us know what he or she did with his or her life that makes it important for us to know about it; the setting is the backdrop, not the explanation. There is an unbridgable gap between ""A Biography Of A Prophet"" and a ""Cultural Biography Of A Religion's Founder"". One need not like Beethoven's music to write a decent biography of him; nor accept that Joseph Smith was a prophet to write one of him. But one would accept that Beethoven claimed to compose music, and that it isn't explained by his culture; and one should accept that Joseph Smith said he was a prophet, and his culture did not drive him to it.And so to the point: Bushman tries to take a man who makes an assertion that he saw and conversed with Jesus Christ, and received revelation and authority from him, and explain how and why he did that in cultural terms. A proper title for Bushman's unfortunate book would be: ""Joseph Smith--If You Cut Him Some Slack, He's Not Such A Nut As You Might Think.""Bushman, in a remarkable display of self-revelation, wrote ""On The Road With Joseph Smith""; a sort of diary of his experiences in selling his book. That the little book should have been published at all reveals a great deal about Bushman's focus--Bushman--; but is also a promotional piece in which he hints that his book has been praised by high authorities in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. It is unvarnished name dropping; and appears among tales of Bushman's weekly checking on the number of copies of Rough Stone sold. The relevance of this to the book under review is obvious: the book is not about Joseph Smith (were it, the LDS book buying public would not need enticements); it is about ""the cultural Joseph Smith""; and there are no ""cultural prophets who actually converse with Jesus Christ"". That claim stands outside of culture; and transcends time and place. Bushman's book is mired in his own cultural miasma: an effor to accomodate the supernatural with the common place.",0,0

Years went by, and like a pebble in my shoe, every time I found myself in a bookstore, I looked for it but I could never seem to recall the title or the author.

Finally, curiosity got the best of me and I did a Google search, “Chef-Castle-Mystery” and viola, hello Elle Newmark, hello Amazon!Sadly, I am less than a quarter way in and I find the author to be overly romantic and fairly unrealistic as to the way that an adolescent boy would think.  “She laughed, and her laughter made me think of a field of wildflowers…” or, “She waved goodbye and her fingers moved like butterflies.”  Sorry, but your slip is showing dear.  There’s also been a couple of confusing time sequences such as Luciano’s last dinner at his benefactor’s home, the curious “murder” and the “onion” lesson all seemed to happen on the same day yet the author did not close these loops correctly and I find that bothersome.  I don’t mind occasional “poetic license” but coupled with the rest of the things that don’t quite line up, such as when the chef instructs Lucianio about how an onion “caramelizes” in the pan.  Pretty certain that word wasn’t in the lexicon back then, nor would an adolescent, street urchin use words like. “Palate” or muse about “motives” for a murder….Maybe I’m just “that guy”I guess, but things like that bother me, especially when they start to add up.  I went online at this time to see if other people had like minded opinions.  I found so far that most of the people who are complimentary, are women.  Without trying to sound too much like a MCP, I say this only because of my insight, as a male tells me that this is work, so far, is that of a romantic.  (Certainly I don’t pretend to speak for all males, but most males, especially adolescents, would no be letting their minds wander to “fields of wildflowers” when they  see their first crush!)  I would think that you would want to make your story appeal to a wider audience.  I will continue the read, as I’ve read several reviews that say the second half of the book is much better.  We’ll see…",0,0
R3PZW969WAZR1R,"This was a big misstep on Amy's part. I get it, she wants to show her fans the real her, and if that works out maybe she'll have the longevity that she frets about probably not having in the book. It tries to be touching and deep and talk about REAL topics like consent, body image, self worth, but I don't think many people are buying it with the expectation of it being a soap box for social justice.This book is a huge departure from Amy's usual schtick and it ends up being excruciating, slow, long, and awkward awkward as opposed to her usual funny awkward. The jokes fall flat (even in the audio book where she, herself, reads it).I don't even think amusing could sum up this book, after 4 chapters in I wanted my money back. I am amazed the average of the reviews was so high, because I totally didn't think this mediocre outing warranted anything more than 2 stars.",0,0

RP4HDVK9ZZZ0M,"I bought a copy from another site, and deemed it defective and returned it. After seeing multiple reviews here saying the sound was ""superb"" ""excellent"" ""great"" etc I figured the disc I received must have been defective. That, and I've been to over a thousand live concerts, and own hundreds of live concert DVDs and Blu Rays, and have never come across one with a soundtrack like this thing. First I played it with the sound coming through the speakers on my TV, which normally sound great. I watched the last of another concert DVD before inserting this, and the other one sounded fabulous. When I immediately noticed this disc had subpar, horrible sound I also tried it through playing it through my 7.1 receiver, and Bose surround sound speakers which sound fantastic playing every other CD, DVD, and Blu Ray I own. And  I own a lot. As in way more than 1,000. I tried it first on 5.1, tried it on 7.1, and tried stereo. Doesn't matter the configuration it sounds horrendous, and is not something I can listen to. I've never heard anything like it, and it's mind boggling to me that people view it as acceptable, let alone good or anything better than that. I'll take it with me next time I go skeet shooting and holler ""pull!"" before I destroy it. Should you buy it? Not my call. All I can say is knowing what I know now if it were selling for fifty cents or even a quarter I wouldn't. If it's not free it's not worth the money in my opinion.",0,0
R355Y3QGCW2VYY,"This work actually makes little or no sense unless you know the codes and the metaphors - and anyone who does isn't admitting it, not that I know of. Do you?The Emerald Tablets and the Hermetica are entirely written in coded metaphors. For instance, God is the thesis or the creator, Kosmos the antithesis or the destroyer, and Space the synthesis between the first two or the preserver. They are a kind of metaphysical and dialectic version of topological triangulation. This is paralleled in the doctrine of the Trinity. Each vertex may also be described geometrically as a set of functions or their opposites. The Hermetica is really coded physics - and not the physics conventionally taught in our schools and universities but rather a hidden physics.I myself have not learned much more than this very basic and simplistic code for a small part of the Hermetica. I also know there are at least 3 levels: the topological metaphor of the physical (deepest), the physics metaphor of the emergence of creation (less deep) and another physics metaphor of the astronomical machine of precession (least deep).If anyone reading this knows more, or can direct us as to where to find more decoding, please add a comment to this review (there's a bit in Farrell's book ""The Grid of the Gods"").Farrell's ""Cosmic War"" traces a cluster of names from ancient Mesopotamia and Egypt that are the same entity as (or very closely related to) Hermes-Thoth including: (An)Zu, Ninurta/Nimrod/Ninus/Enmer/Emerkar, Marduk/Merodach, Nergal, Baal/Osiris/Tammuz/Adonis/Dionysus/Bacchus, Enki/Ea/Eyah/Yahweh/Lucifer/Ra/Sungod/Lightbearer and even the Mason's Hiram Abiff. [Later note: Farrell's ""Thrice Great Hermetica"" provides even more insight into Hermetica.]I would like to suggest, instead of Hermes, two of the greatest hermetic teachers in history: Thomas H Burgoyne's ""The Light of Egypt: v. 1: The Science of the Soul and the Stars"" - a great classic work of mystical enlightenment and Russell Walter's ""A New Concept of the Universe"". For those interested in truths, I also suggest Tsarion, a deep thinker of our time about ancient secrets, who shows (for example)how the Emerald Tablets actually refer to the tarot. Not in the variations the tarot is known of today, but its original form, involving a mixture of kabala, tarot, numerology and astrology, which he explains are sister disciplines. You can learn more about this (free) from Tsarion himself - there are hours and hours of Tsarion on youtube, mostly fascinating.For much much more on the secrets of ""pre""history than 99.99 per cent of us can possibly glean from this book, see Lana Cantrell's ""Greatest Story Never Told"" which is available free on the internet - verbose but amazing in parts. Also see Shannon Dorey's 3 books on the Nummo.As for Jordan Maxwell's ""The Brotherhood of the Illes"" - another blow-your-mind book available free on the internet... and Santos Bonacci (starting with As Above so Below' (especially part 2) and with 'Sovereignty-Roman Law'... well you need to experience them for yourself. You may also benefit from Frank O'Collins' monumental body of work, available free from the Ucadia websites, the result of 26 years of work.",0,0
R283JNQAWBF30N,"I am a glutton for punishment. I bought this book despite having read both the previous Theodore Boone stories.Those, I notice, who defend these awful books do so on the grounds that they are books for children and therefore cannot be expected to be well written. Maybe, I thought, it is an American thing. Maybe American children can't read well written books, can only manage ""the cat sat on the mat"" type of literature. But that is obviously wrong. After all, it was America which gave us Mark Twain.No, as I have mentioned before, the explanation is almost certainly that Mr Grisham's publishers (like a few of the adult reviewers here) have convinced themselves that the modern American child is terribly dim compared with his ancestors. He won't read a book, they think, unless the prose is horribly wooden and nothing complicated or difficult is to be found in it.And the main character becomes more and more unattractive with each book. I really can't believe that America is full of young teenage boys who long to be goody-goody bores, endlessly pontificating to their peers on the wonders of the American justice system and never doing anything naughty at all.Theo, I am sorry to report to you, is no Tom Sawyer. All red-blooded boys (and probably girls as well) will yearn to give him a good kicking. But Mr Grisham's publishers (I can't believe he is stupid enough to think as they do) are sure that a modern child hero must be a prim, goody-goody who would faint at the suggestion he should ever step out of line.Please, Mr Grisham, get back to writing the novels you are so good at. Alternatively, explain to your publishers that children are not nearly so stupid as they (your publishers) think they are.Charles",0,0

R1OWYOHQF76H6T,"Poor Harry. In earlier books he was loaded with flaws but remained a likable character despite them. He had character. This book differs markedly from the earlier works. Harry's flaws become so pronounced that he ceases to be someone you like despite them. And the overall theme of the book is depressing, and boringly so. Page after page is devoted to rampant drug traffic and horrifically lost people of all ages. Harry's relationship with Rakel and Oleg becomes so fraught with introspection and analysis that I nearly put the book down.The redeeming quality of the book is its backdrop for the book that follows, POLICE, which is a very good mystery full of surprises and suspense. Harry is more believable here and the relationships less suffocating. That, however, is for some other review.",0,0

My routine for the Tarte Maracuja oil is that I apply it every night prior to bed. I normally wake with baby-soft, supple, and smooth skin. After beginning use of the product from amazon my skin texture become drastically uneven and I have had a stye on one of my eyes after every night of use. I quit using the product two nights ago and picked up a new bottle from sephora and my skin is back to baby soft and my eyes are stye free.

R2EPQAOEVMVXI,"Ok so, I don't want to go into a big ""blah blah"" statement here. I'll try to keep this short.In the first movie Neo is determined to free all humans from their enslavement by machines.In the end he makes a deal with the source to save Zion after it's pretty much destroyed. His deal is to let the machines continue to use humans as an energy source as long as they leave Zion alone.In the first Matrix Neo is ""the one"", then in the second he isn't the ""one"", but one of many. Despite this he manages to transgress part of his humanity and actually has the ability to affect the machines in the physical world. In the third he can destroy the machines, and yet when confronted with the source does nothing. He strikes a deal.In the first Matrix, Trinity is knowledgeble, powerful, a leader if only by example. In the second she's still tough, but nearly gets killed. Neo saves her from her untimely death; a death that would have made sense in the second movie. Trinity would have died for a reason, her personal ""greater good"". In the third movie she dies, because she dies. Her big kiss off is supposed to be alright because she found Neo. whatever.Mr. Smith is a funny albeit normal agent in the first Matrix. In the second he is freed from the enslavement of the Matrix. That part is still kind of a , ""huh?"" to me, but it's okay because I love his character. In the third movie ,when it looks as though he could wipe out the Matrix, Neo stops him. Why? Losing all humankind is still better than submission to a force that could destroy you at any given time if you ask me. Besides you'd still have Zion, depending on whether or not they did what I'm about to mention.Zion in the first Matrix is the last bastion of humans that the machines can't get to. In the second we see it, and it's a well gaurded city. We then discover they are drilling down. After the machines breach Zion and start swarming in; the human faction engages in closed combat with them. At a certain point in the third movie they use EMP bombs and it decimates a whole room full of squidies (machines). Why not place loads of these bombs while you have time in the second movie, ahead of where they are drilling, and have your forces fall back. It would have been a lot more economical than wasting complex machinery and human lives on an obviously ridiculous battle.In going to a movie I'm asking to be whisked away for my $9. I don't go to a movie, let alone a sci-fi movie to be let down by a character I've invested time, money and aspirations in. I beleived Neo in the first movie when he says, ""I'm going to show these people what you don't want them to see"". When he agrees to let people stay batteries so that a single half destroyed city can stay intact, I'm heartbroken. I feel sold out. It's the equivalent of Luke Skywalker turning to the dark side and killing all his friends at the end of Star Wars, or Sauron getting the ring of power in the end of Lord of the Rings. Here's a little secret 'tween us; what made Lord of the Rings successful besides it's huge preexistant fan base, was that there was lots of hardship and struggle, just like the Matrix, but in the end even if by happenstance and luck the destruction of the ring took place. We got our money's worth, and our dedication and time spent payed off. I would have loved to see a good third Matrix, but alas I was deeply disappointed. My only regret is that I couldn't give this movie zero stars.",0,0

R1985A15FJE71X,"I think reviewing this novel would be more difficult than reading it was, so I'm not going to bother.  Here's my bottom line opinion: It is evident from the novel that Pynchon is unquestionably a smart man and more knowledgable about most things than I could ever hope to be, but Gravity's Rainbow is on the whole pretty bad.If extracted, the mediocre main plot would occupy all of perhaps 200 pages.  It might have been somewhat interesting standing on its own.  But the other 650+ (!!!) pages of non value adding digression utterly ruins this novel.  Occasionally humorous but mostly a tiresome chore to get through.  I'm not even sure how I did it.  I read it during lunch hour perhaps twice a week, over a period of maybe five or six months.  Never got engrossed and only enjoyed what I was reading maybe 5%-10% of the time.  But I persevered for two reasons:1. I'd heard it was the most difficult fiction novel ever and challenging to finish.  I wanted to see if I could do it.2. I'd hoped the plot would improve further in as Slothrop neared his goal.Ok, so I finished it but was the time spent worth it?  Absolutely not, without question.

It sounds silly and unrealistic but she writes these books in a way that you really get the feeling that these things could happen, you get inspired to reach out and take advantage of whatever opportunity chance sends your way. I have read many of her books, but my particular favorites were  Tara Road  and  Nights of Rain and Stars . Unfortunately A Week in Winter seems unfinished. Each character's story is resolved in a heavy handed way, like she had written the outline of how she wanted each situation resolved but never got to work her magic on them.

After seeing the movie I caught a glimpse of what Woody Allen's personality is really like. His character, Alvy Singer is expressed as an OCD freak, on top of that he's extremely creepy. Diane Keaton won an undeserved oscar for this role. Why? I dont know. It isn't that great, I have seen mostly postitive reviews, however there has got to be someone who agrees with me. It isn't that good, and it isn't worth watching. IT is absolutely boring, and on top of that it has no sense to it. Basically the movie is about a self-concious man named Alvy, he falls for a woman who is just like him, and the movie just focuses on their on/off romance. It is indeed very bizarre. By the end of the film, I was relieved because it was finally over. There was no humor, and whatever humor there was, it was mostly dry. So please if you are looking for a romantic comedy, try ""Sleepless In Seattle"" or ""Hitch"", this isn't worth watching.",0,0

R1VVRSVWAUXEKH,"Before I dive into this review, let me just say that I really enjoyed the movie and the story in an overall manner. Most of us know the story of ‘Carrie’, poor girl bullied by her classmates for most of her life, showering them with hell when she is pushed too far, awaking her telekinetic powers to full storm.So why did I give two stars you ask? Stephen King is a very wordy guy. A big thing I hate when I’m reading something is a book that has no chapters. When it comes to ‘Carrie’, for those of you who haven’t read it, There is a mixture of Carrie’s PoV to her principal, her teachers, Sue Snell, her biggest bully (Chris), and so on. There are also newspaper clippings and sections from books about telekinetic powers. To me, the whole thing felt like a jumbled mess. Like he didn’t get the chance to line things up in an organized manner before the publishers had it printed off. Or maybe they were so amazed by the story itself, they didn’t think anything of it. I know he is a big time author, I generally do like his books, I just had to keep pushing myself to read this one.I started this book October 1st. This was supposed to be my big Halloween Read along with ‘Coraline’. I finished it last night, November 5th. Books don’t take me this long to read. I just couldn’t get through it the way I wanted to but I pushed myself and finished it. I think the book would have been more of an impact if it had chapters and at the beginning of each, it featured a newspaper clipping or an interview with the police like it does throughout. Those were really awesome to read. Reading about the people who lived and their experience of what impacted their life in such a tragic way.Now that I have gone through and given an overall feel of why I didn’t like it, I would like to say SPOILER for those of you who haven’t read it or seen the movie and want to. They aren’t HUGE spoilers but I did make a couple notes while reading the book that I’d like to bring attention to.1. It makes me sick how the kids at her school treated Carrie. The girl gets her first period without knowing what it is and panics. Instead of helping her, they beam her with tampons and pads. That honestly broke my heart. I have been bullied in my life before but no where near this. I just wanted to jump into the book and help the girl. Miss Desjardin helped a bit and I respect her for that. Taking a peak into her mind though, she didn’t want to. She thought of Carrie the same way everyone else did. A freak. Carrie had no real friends. She didn’t even have acquaintances. The only question I had here was- Did she know that she had the power of telekinesis? that she could move things with her mind and cause the lights around her to explode when she was faced with stress? In the movie, she studied about it.2. We take a dive into Carrie’s demented dream about Jesus chasing her with nails trying to pin her on the cross with him. Um.. okay. First off, CREEPY AF!!!!! I could never imagine a sinister Christ or him begging for anyone to join him the way he died. It just shows us how much her mother got into her head with the “we’re all sinners”. She throws her in the closet to make her repent for things like getting her period or showering in gym class, assuming that she was having lustful thoughts or becoming a woman when “good girls” don’t do that.3. Its sad seeing how her mother takes the fact that she got her period. She kicks her, locking her in the closet for hours at a time. Not even letting her out to use the bathroom. Making her lay in her own waste.4. I have a huge problem with Christina. If she doesn’t believe in God or hell, why does it matter if someone else says that you’re going to hell? God has the final judgement anyway so just ignore the comments. I feel like she is just a bitch because she can be.5. How does the principal, Sue Snell, and the Vice Principal ALL assume SOMETHING will go down at the prom yet no one investigates or checks it out for sure? All of these people deserve to live with the guilt of what they did to Carrie. They all had a chance to stop whatever was going to happen. Even had a chance to stop what was going on within the school but they turned a blind eye. I get Sue sent her boyfriend to the prom with Carrie but that isn’t a big sorry. Or really one at all.6. The big scene has arrived and yet, I am struggling to get through it. Why? Because Stephen King is dragging this out. He is throwing in all of the interviews of what happened. Skipping ahead in the story then jumping back. He tells about how Bill set everything up, AFTER she already had the blood poured all over her. King focuses so much on the scenery, that I found myself skimming through it.Final Thoughts: Its so hard knowing everything Carrie went through began with her mother. “I came to kill you, Momma”. Such an impact… I feel sorry for Carrie. I wish I could be there for her. Be the friend she needed. This book really did drag on for what felt like forever. 305 pages shouldn’t have taken 36 days to complete. Even with my two jobs.Do I recommend the book? Sure, if you’d like to see how the story of Carrie started. The movie follows the book surprisingly closely. Just beware of the dragging feeling. You can make it. I promise!",0,0

RLM4EY71EOUDP,"Diana Krall does not have a naturally great singing voice.... but I own nearly all of Diana Kralls jazz CDs and have considered myself a fan of this bright talent for several significant reasons.1. Her vocal PHRASING has been incredible.  Jazz is a difficult genre to sing because the phrasing and the emotion a singer places on certain words or phrases in a song become paramount. Sarah Vaughn, Anita O'Day, Carmen McRae, Billie Holiday and Ella Fitzgerald all had superb phrasing and expressed great emotion in their singing, and Diana became heir to this style and yet had a magical and unique phrasing all her own. It made her a bright young star in the world of jazz.2. Diana has consistantly taken the high road in the QUALITY of the songs she has selected with her producers. The songs she has performed are genuinely classic, timeless and difficult to sing. Diana met the challenge and not only performed them without ""vocal gymnastics"" but respected these songs in the way Frank Sinatra did.... allowing the song to be heard as written by the composer. Lyric and melody intact, yet charming us with a style and musicianship clearly her own.3. Diana's arrangements were thought out, subtile, expressive and appropriate for the song. Superb full-scale arrangements by Claus Ogerman, or simple combos with Diana's signature piano style that carressed the song melody so perfectly.""The Girl in the Other Room"" has NONE of the above. The original songs on the album are not sophisticated nor particularly interesting enough to need great emotion, and they don't get much of it here....  and the lyrics and tone of these tunes seem to be self-absorbed and, funny enough, depressing. The remainder of the songs, though better constructed, do not suit Diana's voice or style, though she has given it her best but she is on very foreign turf here. There are plenty of singers who do this very genre much more justice... Norah Jones, Mary Chapin Carpenter, Sarah Mclachlan, Tierney Sutton, Bonnie Raitt and Rickie Lee Jones to name a few.For ""demanding"" jazz fans who crave those rare albums of sophistication, romance, passion and musicianship in lyric and melody that (Diana has given us in abundance in the past) will find this album a huge disappointment both musically and emotionally. Those who enjoy a simpler style of pop won't mind this album, but would be better served by those mentioned above who perform it so very well. If Diana is indeed experimenting with new styles of singing, perhaps a country, blues or hip-hop album is next? She would perform those just as well... but what for?",0,0

R117SBMU46RAJ4,"Bad directing, bad acting, bad cut and paste of different scenes, bad scripts, ...Most of the actors and actresses have only one or two facial expressions. The bad guys are like crazy maniacs, not like devils. There is a difference between maniacs and devils. The internal voices of all the good guys are like murmuring. There is no passion or change in tone regardless of the situation or content of the internal voices. The pace of this movie is not slow, but when the good guys talk, they always talk as if they have taken some sedative drugs. So, people talk like sloths in the future? The special effects of this movie is extremely poor and is no where close of Star Wars. The so-called worm is unbelievably fake. Some screen shots are very beautiful, like people standing in the desert, but do not add much value to the content of the movie. After watching this movie for an hour, I have no clue what the main theme of this movie is. Is it about the unification of the universe and getting rid of the bad guys? I simply don't see the urgency.A good sci fi movie is about some mysteries and the final unraveling of the mysteries. The mysteries are not clearly stated in this movie. After 1 hour watching this movie, there is still no clue of what mysteries are to be solved. It is like you need to ask a question first, then someone will give an answer.  The audience anticipate an answer. It is this anticipation that makes a good sci fi movie good.Someone suggested that you need to watch this movie three times to appreciate it. Maybe it is because the mysteries will be ""announced"" towards the very end of this movie which is followed immediately by the unraveling of the mysteries. LOL Perhaps this is why you need to watch this movie many times. A good movie is a good movie when you first watch it. You don't need to watch it 3 times in order to appreciate it.",0,0

R2JPOR5HTE7PVA,"The ""survivalist"" character is dumb.  He prefers a pistol to a M4 rifle.  He walks right up to the bad guy, draws his pistol and points it at his face, then laughs and holsters it, telling him to get out by high noon.  It's great that he's good with his pistol, but that's totally unrealistic considering the advantages of an semi-auto long rifle over a pistol.The President's daughter, who is supposed to be 9-10yrs old, has the wit and humor of a 15-18yr old.  I have a few kids and it's clear that the author does not.If you want to read a modern western novel, this is it.  If you're looking for a realistic survival book, look elsewhere.  The editing was good and I only found one error, which was nice for a change in this genre.  I rarely leave 2 stars, much less comment; but I was disappointed in this book- especially with all the 5 star reviews.It would be better if the author researched prepping more and had a character with some flaws (besides loving his pistol so much).",0,0

RE0PE9FDSMFIZ,"BLOW FLYA really awful bookWe got this book on tape on sale at Sam's Club to keep us awake on a 14 hour drive.  To see what the book was about, we read the first page of a paper copy. It sounded a lot like the TV program CSI. This is an alert that book is not like CSI and deserves an R rating for language, violence, and sexual content.My main problem with the book is that it is too gross, wordy, and slow-moving. There are too many banal similes and too much boring detail. There is also too much extended, graphic descriptions of sex and violence. After six hours of it I was attempting to fast forward through the second digression into the thoughts of one of the psychopathic killers. The first time we were dragged through what he intended to do to his next victim. That was more than enough to convince me that he was crazy and awful. I didn't need the later diversion into his memories of victims past and what he did to them.I wanted to like the main character, but she did not appear often and was rather pitiful due to losing her job as the result of making a bad mistake at the end of the previous book. I wanted to like at least two other characters, but they turned out to be people who often behaved in ways that were not to like.We finally gave up on the book. Since the author had by then set up two characters with plans that were converging to impact the main character, I wondered how the story ended. Surely it had to end badly for many of the characters, since they were mostly behaving badly. I thought I could find out how the plot worked out by looking in a printed copy in a book store. However, what would normally be a rather large display of the book was sold out. I could not understand how such an awful book could be selling so well, so I read the reviews on Amazon. I found that many fans of the author's previous books in the series bought the book but hated it. Most telling was that they also hated the ending. One reviewer described throwing the book across the room out of disgust with the ending. At that point I did not care about the ending any more.",0,0
R1CQMDQ660SKLZ,I've never given one of his books 1 star before.  But I really don't consider this one of his books. First of all Harry is a man of few words.  The dialogue with him and everyone else is contrived.  And Mickey Haller?  This was NOT Mickey Haller.  He  never had such a foul mouth and he would NEVER use the word 'brohiem.'  And Harry would have smacked him if he called him that!  All dialogue must have been written by those who he acknowledged at the end of the book.  No this was not written by Connelly.  The plot had such potential.  There were glimpses of the old Harry- just not enough of them.  My major complaint is with Haller's dialogue. He acted like an ass.  I was groaning at their last scene together and wanting the book to be over. I've NEVER felt that with a Harry Bosch book before.  It was inexcusable.,0,0

RL9F61R2JSCIN,"American and Hollywood themes heavily injected, spoiling  the authenticity of the real story. Themes Such as: Hatred of Russia, display of excessive, confrontational and arrogant personality, and romanticizing Jews.I've read the Book [a serious scholarly work] “Defiance” by Prof Nechama Teck upon which the film is supposedly made, The film and the book do not correspond, many scenes in the film are hugely Hollywood invented, as well as including  American Hollywood themes such as:Hatred or negativity towards Russia: The Russian partisans depicted in the film are generally portrayed as bad, antisemitic characters. In reality  the picture was much more complex. The extensive  interactions of the Bielskis with other Soviet partisans in the area was very complex, involving  negative and positive sides as well. Danger from them as well as comradeship and assistance. It is a typical Hollywood lie that Russian partisan commander refused to inform the Bielskies of the “big hunt”, in reality they were very well informed.  One particularly disturbing  scene is where Tuvia sneaks into a ghetto and having an audience with ghetto inmates and its elders, trying to convince them to run away with him into the forest, Tuvia reassures them with: “We have made an alliance with the Russian partisans”. The leader of the ghetto dismissively responds with “They are as bad as the Germans, you are too young to know the pogroms!”. Nothing like that comes in the book by Teck [the real story], there was no such an exchange. I cant believe that any Jew in German occupied eastern Europe would have said something like that. If the Jews at that time had any hope on someone to come and save them, that one could only be the Soviets/Russia which indeed came in the end and saved whatether left, as well as probably saving much of the entire Slavic race from extermination in German hands. The western allies had no interest in stopping the Holocaust and they betrayed Poland and Czechoslovakia. The death camps were liberated by the Red Army who put a stop to the Holocaust. [By the way, I'm not a communist, but you cant deny history, it is a high time that both Jews and Poles come to acknowledge that the Soviets saved them from extinction]Display of excessive, confrontational and arrogant personality: In the film, a rivalry is depicted between the two brothers, Zus and Tuvia , that even comes to fists and blows. Zus is shown as an  American Macho-man openly defying Tuvia with Arguments and “his” way. Again, in the book, nothing like that appears, no problem between the brothers. There were other serious internal problems in the Otriad, they were usually solved in military fashion, orders and court-marshals, even two executions.Romanticizing of Jews: In the film, a central character is shown beside the 3 brothers, his name is Shimon. One is assumed that he is a Rabbi or other Jewish spiritual teacher, an orthodox Jew. No such a  figure is shown in the book, no such a Jewish spiritual central figure was there.one scene shows a traditional Jewish wedding, the Rabbi officiating is the above Shimon. The wedding is even  complete with Klezmer music, a very nice and romantic scene. but again, in reality there were no such weddings there in the forests. Infact [according to the book by Teck], liberal and casual sex were the common practice there.The only reason I give the film two stars is the positive side of the film- the excellent acting by Daniel Craig who gives some of the idea and flavour of the magnitude of the personality of Tuvia [who is the central focus of the book by Teck].",0,0
R2E58ON5FW6F8B,"Though I gave it 3 stars, 2006's Cars is widely regarded as Pixar's least impressive film, especially when considering the fact that every other entry in the animation studio's canon has earned 5 stars from me. What, then, prompted this sequel, when there would appear to be so many other worthy entries to expand into franchises? Some argue that it was a money grab, seeing as how Cars merchandise has been disgustingly popular with the kiddies. Others argue that... Well, okay, I haven't heard much in the way of a counterargument, considering Cars 2 went on to become the first 1 star movie for Pixar. This time around, Lightning McQueen and his buddy Mater do a bit of globetrotting for a World Grand Prix, during which Mater becomes unwittingly involved in an international espionage operation. Despite the film's fantastic visual flourishes, Cars 2 lacks compelling storytelling, making it possibly the first Pixar film not to appeal successfully to adults as much as children. The cast, which includes Michael Caine, Emily Mortimer, John Turturro, and more, is great, though, and kids will undoubtedly love it, so there you go.",0,0
R1GXB3PE989IAO,"I had high expectations for this book but was sadly disappointed. The author makes numerous statements along the lines of, ""Lincoln tried repeatedly to do such and such,"" but provides no documentation to substantiate those assertions. There are very few in-line blocks of quoted text, and what footnotes exist, and the text as well, point mostly to others' work. There's simply an amazing lack of citations like ""on this specific date Lincoln said the following in a speech before whomever"", it's almost exclusively a list of unproved assertions.I'll include a specific cite, though. At location 457 (on a Kindle), the author states ""Right-wing economist Thomas Sowell ... believes the ancient habits and folkways of the South are still so influential that they control the behavior of entire regions of the north today. (Conservatives like Sowell used to champion individual responsibility and excoriate ""liberals"" who searched for ""root causes"" of deviant behavior. No longer, at least in Sowell's case.)""Anyone who draws that baffling conclusion from Dr Sowell's writing on race and economics is so obtuse and demonstrably in error that anything that follows is simply irrelevant.I want my money back.To top it off, the Kindle conversion is less than stellar: there are what appears originally to have been pull quotes that on the Kindle appear in the middle of existing text (between paragraphs), and there are typos.

R22SIBCO38JROA,"I'll start off by saying I am (or was) a big fan of Garth Nix. It's a simple fact that he's a great storyteller. He's creative, inventive, and does a phenomenal job at developing not only his characters, but the worlds they traverse. I'm saying this, only having read Shade's Children and the Keys to the Kingdom series. I loved the Keys to the Kingdom. It really doesn't get much better than that.I picked up this book after reading the Keys to the Kingdom, hoping that Nix was a good a writer before he wrote Keys to the Kingdom as he is now. I was presently surprised. A brilliant story greeted me with fascinating characters, and a wonderfully twisted plot. His writing was great, and I immediately loved the style and the mood. Dark, broody, mysterious.This book had huge potential, and I knew that if Garth Nix kept going like he was, this book would be at the top favorite list. But then he ruined it with something that is the least necessary for a book meant for ages twelve and up.Halfway through Nix suddenly started throwing strong sexual themes into it. More than just themes... and in a book meant for kids twelve and up.This sent the book to the bottom of my do not read list.

R660CDHH8JCHD,"Actual Rating = 2.5I read this for the first time when I was in my early teens, so about 15-ish years ago now. I enjoyed it more then, which is interesting because this is NOT a YA novel.This story focuses on Tirzah, a slave who is also an Elemental - someone who can talk to glass. She and her father are purchased and taken to the building site of Threshold, a glass-heavy pyramid being constructed by the math-obsessed Magi. She ends up in a complicated relationship with Boaz, a Magi and nephew of the king (not his title in the book but using it here for clarity).This tale is super imaginative and I love the setting. Anything inspired by ancient Egypt has my attention, at a minimum. That said, when re-reading this as an adult I found the characters to be way more unrelatable than I'd found them as a kid. Maybe my relatively low rating is because I was disappointed upon a re-read....what do y'all think?",0,0

R3MIJR3YJ5RACO,"This fascinating book is about the Chabad-Lubavitch movement and its late Rebbe, Menachem Mendel Schneerson (1902-94).This work is a well written account containing much interesting information.  The writer has clearly put a lot of work into this book and traveled widely to visit the various Chabad houses dotted all over the USA.I must admit, however, that I did find it a bit overburdened at times with narrative causing each chapter to be unnecessarily lengthy - but this may be just a male response!  The disturbing thing about the book is that the writer was clearly overawed by the Rebbe's shlichim [emissaries] - and one can even see why.  But this has resulted in an insufficiently critical perspective.  For example, shlichim are very persuasive in their assurances that they are not out to hijack Judaism, yet a Google search for Orthodox synagogues brings up, among other things, the Chabad-Lubavitch website which siphons people off to various Chabad houses and does not give an overall listing of Orthodox synagogues.Furthermore, the book barely touches on the theological aberrations of this movement (e.g.: God-in-everything [which is a distortion of the authentic Biblical teaching that God is everywhere or `omnipresent'] and reincarnation).  Of course, it can be argued that such an analysis was not the author's intention.  Nevertheless, as this is a book for lay-people, this would have been helpful.There is somewhat more emphasis on the bizarre practices involved in trying to keep in touch with the Rebbe after his death.  The question of whether some of this constitutes praying to the Rebbe is raised [pp.228, 277-278, 284], although the writer shies away from discussing any possibility that spiritism is involved in contacting spirits of departed people (contra Deuteronomy 18:9-14, for example).  However, an entire chapter is at least devoted to the key controversy in Jewish circles: namely the Rebbe's alleged Messiahship.From an interfaith perspective, I found two especially interesting issues.  The first is that the movement comes across as a kind of counterfeit of the New Covenant Faith as introduced by Jesus of Nazareth, who is arguably, and despite detractors, the best Jew who ever walked on this Earth.The second is the messianic element in this movement.  The chief opponent of this in Orthodox circles is Rabbi David Berger of the Rabbinical Council of America, who has attempted to persuade the Orthodox community that it must act vigorously to delegitimate what he has described as ""the false messianism and avodah zarah prevalent in the Lubavitch movement."" [The Rabbinical Council of America]Rabbi Berger has expressed his grief over this trend in these words: ""Despite a 1996 RCA resolution that was a source of deep gratification, these efforts have not met with much success, so that I live with the unspeakably distressing consciousness that after devoting much of my career to the study of the Jewish-Christian debate, I have seen the Orthodox rabbinate of my generation destroy defining elements of the religion they are charged to protect and obliterate the fundamental theological distinctions between Judaism and Christianity that our ancestors gave their lives to preserve."" [Ibid.]  But this merely raises the question as to whether the boundaries of Judaism are really as tight as Rabbi Berger would like.Clearly Lubavitcher messianism undermines a major plank in Rabbi Berger's thinking and raises the question of whether post-Yavneh rabbis have been on the wrong tack in rejecting Jesus of Nazareth as the true Messiah.  It is interesting to compare Rabbi Berger's remark with a comment by the late Gershom Scholem in the introduction to his book on Sabbatai Zevi (1626-76), an earlier false Messiah who converted to Islam under threat.  With characteristic perceptivity, Scholem wrote:There is no way of telling a priori what beliefs are possible or impossible within the framework of Judaism. ... .  The ""Jewishness"" in the religiosity of any particular period is not measured by dogmatic criteria that are unrelated to historical circumstances, but solely by what sincere Jews do, in fact, believe, or at least consider, to be legitimate possibilities. [Sabbatai Sevi: The mystical Messiah (1975), p.xi]So, then, rejection of Jesus' Messiahship is in the end not an issue of truth, but rather of current Jewish consensus.  Leading Orthodox Rabbi Dr Norman Lamm, quoted by Fishkoff, evidently finds this aspect of the Chabad-Lubavitch worrying as it undermines the currently-accepted paradigm:""If they believe the Rebbe could have been Moshiach, fine, I agree.  Many people could have been the Moshiach, and he had a far better chance than most.  But to say he's the Moshiach after he died?  The whole polemic we've had with Christianity for two thousand years is that we say a Moshiach who did not accomplish world peace, who did not accomplish the redemption of Israel and the world, is not Moshiach.  And here we're told that [the Rebbe] can be.  If that's the case, why were we so reluctant to accept Jesus?"" [p.268].Indeed, why?  How could we have missed him when the Scriptures are so plain?  This is probably the greatest tragedy in the history of mankind and explains so much of what is going in the world today.  Think how different the course of human history would have been if Jesus of Nazareth had been universally embraced from the start as Word of God, Messiah, and King of Creation.Rating this book is something of a dilemma.  For style and reportage, I would rate it highly.  But, because of important omissions and inasmuch as this book could be used to provide propaganda for the Chabad-Lubavitch movement, I have to set my rating low.",0,0

R19BMNVCSFMHAP,"Cat Jones, editor-in-chief of the Cosmo-esque Gloss magazine, goes to confront her nanny early one Sunday morning, and when she doesn't  get a response to the live in apartment, who does she call?  No, not the police, or her husband.  Cat calls Bailey Weggins, friend and freelance crime journalist at Gloss magazine.When Bailey enters the nanny's apartment, she finds the 22-year old nanny dead.  And Cat, always the editor-in-chief, assigns Baily to mirror the police investigation and determine what is going on.When I read the pre-releases for IF LOOKS COULD KILL (""Bridget Jones Meets Nancy Drew"") I thought it sounded like a fun book.  I've enjoyed good mysteries (such as THE ALPHABET MYSTERY SERIES by Sue Grafton) and I liked THE NANNY DIARIES, so I thought a marriage between the two would be fun.Unfortunately, we get a fairly standard mystery, and somewhat pedestrian plotting.Bailey Weggins is supposed to be observant, beseeched by her friend Cat to involve herself in this mystery because of her unique way of looking at things.  Mostly, Bailey looks at clothes.  Every character is first described by what they're wearing.Bailey is also into good food.  Each chapter has her hankering after a good penne putenesca or a fine rissoto.  I almost expect for the recipes and restaurant reviews to be included as an appendix.Also, the motivations of the main characters here are somewhat forced.  Why does Cat choose Bailey, of all people, to help her out with this?  When Bailey senses herself in danger, why doesn't she just beg off somehow?All in all, this was a disappointing entry into what will probably turn out to be a fairly average mystery series.  If you like mysteries in general, or if you are really in to behind the scenes glimpses of glamour magazines, then this book is for you.Otherwise, take a look at some of the other beach reading out there.Kilroy's Rating System:5 stars - Loved it, and kept it on my bookshelf.4 stars - Liked it, and gave it to a friend.3 stars - OK, finished it and gave it to the library.2 stars - Not good, finished it, but felt guilty and/or cheated by it.1 star - I want my hour back!

R2IP0NMLCFB57,"I had high expectations for this movie, but it ended up being a major failure. It was also boring. Seeing boring and Steve Carell in the same sentence is not something you see everyday. He has a proven track record of enjoyable movies such as The 40 Year Old Virgin, Over The Hedge, Little Miss Sunshine, Dan In Real Life, Get Smart, Evan Almighty, Horton Hears A Who!, Despicable Me, and Dinner For Schmucks. I was expecting this movie to be on that same level. But it failed to accomplish that. The speech during the graduation by Cal (Carell) seemed forced and awkward. Other than that, Carell's performance wasn't bad. But his best dramedy character is Dan Burns in the movie Dan In Real Life. Julianne Moore's character is easily forgettable. For a memorable Julianne Moore character, check out Freedomland. Emma Stone is also a forgettable character here. Ryan Goseling is the latest one to strike while the iron is hot, being in 3 awful or easy to forget movies that came out in 2011. Those movies being this, Drive, and The Ides Of March. Goseling gets somewhat of a pass because he's in Remember The Titans and I like that movie. I love Marissa Tomei and I was disappointed that her role was a bit part. She's clearly the stand out character of this movie. Kevin Bacon as the romantic antagonist David Lindhagen, is rather light weight. He's not sinister enough in his role. The whole boy and baby sitter subplot was really awkward and creepy. His public displays of love were way over the top, the babysitter's crush on Cal is creepy, the pics the babysitter sends Cal are creepy, and the boy's speech is very unrealistic. And to ask the same question another reviewer asked: why does a 13 year old need a baby sitter? I could see him needing a baby sitter if he were 10. But not at 13. Nothing but a stupid incoherent plot point. The title of this movie is only 1/3 accurate, with that 1/3 being STUPID!",0,0

R21YZ160D8ZZVW,"Nonsense and hoi-polloi.  Atrocious stupidity, and a waste of time to boot.  Here's a tip, sort the ratings by most helpful, and see what you find.  This album is a joke, and a few jerks are trying to raise its ratings artificially so that more people get taken in.  It's mean, and it's a lousy thing to do to someone else.  All of the good reviews admit that it's arrhythmic, atonal, raspy, gritty, bad musicianship, with bass that sounds like someone falling downstairs, etc.  Think to yourself: how could this be simultaneously so unpleasant to listen to, but also worthy of 5 stars?  Of course, it can't be.  It's a stupid prank, and so are the 5 star reviews.  Half the time they insult your intelligence, and the other half of the time, they try to make you insecure.  Trust me, you'll be a lot better off without a nonsensical headache like this in your collection.-Paul-",1,1
R2C1H65C514P16,"I loved The Warded Man, and thought the followup, The Desert Spear, filled in some interesting back story while still advancing the plot. The latest volume The Daylight War spends a large chunk of time giving us Inevera's back story, which is significantly less interesting than Jardirs, while doing almost nothing to advance the plot of the series. Hundreds of pages float idly by where nothing much of interest happens, interspersed with battles completely devoid of tension that devolve into Arlen or Jardir, depending on the locale, using their newly discovered super duper powers to save the day. Of course, when the book is about to make progress towards something interesting it ends. A very disappointing addition to a formerly well regarded series.

R2MG0PNC6JUHSE,"How the heck did Diana Krall ever have a singing career let alone be the top-selling jazz vocalist in recent years?  She's awful!  She comes in with these low, soft vocals like she's in a cigar store, but the truth is she sings flat off key; she's weak, lacks body, and can't even find her own pitch.  And, it's great that there's such an excellent production on this CD, ""The Girl in the Other Room,"" but the voice of Mickey Mouse would've been more interesting.  She can't hit a note to save her life.  Why can't she take some singing lessons?  The small but excellent band along with the CD's excellent recording brings out every lacking thing about Ms. Diana Krall.  Maybe she's good for people who have no ear for tone and don't know what a well-trained voice will sound like.  Her success is good for the money, and so she gets produced.  She lacks even the natural ability some of today's pop singers seem to possess without much formal training.  Krall seems to have no interest in voice education; her wimpy voice agitates like the grinding of metal.Also, who is she to sing jazz?  Who's her audience?  Maybe she gets marketed well.  I just don't get her success from what she does as ""stylish.""  Popularity doesn't mean critically good.  While some singers may not have all the training one would hope, she's just awful.  Why is a white Canadian blonde singing an American art like this in the first place?  How do her consumers justify her (other than general insanity, I mean)?  Does she come from an economically-impoverished background?  Does she have some connection to the civil rights movement?  What does she know about the blues?  Apparently she just likes Edward G. Robinson on a bridge on a foggy night--film noir.  So what of it?  Krall is a joke.  She hasn't a fiber of anything even resembling Julie London.  Whenever I listen to her, I find myself getting angry and saying, ""Why doesn't she cut out the cinematics and just sing the song?""  I don't think that's possible.  She also makes frequent mistakes playing the piano as well.  She should take some college courses in Communications.  Musicians other than Diana Krall of this disc: Five-Star Rating.

R1LH5KQY8K4SC8,"I was given this book as a gift from my pastor.  And, on my second attempt I managed to read it (all in one sitting, during a flight across the Atlantic from the States to Ireland).Although I appreciate the spirit in which Erik Raymond wrote his review, I find the Calvin presented in this particular book to be a polished-up version of what most of today's pastors are (or aspire to be): a better-than-average rhetorician who crafts his ""sermon"" from 1 oz. Gospel, 1/2 cup Law, 1 pound personal opinion and just a dash of theology and/or original language.  The result may be a religiously inspiring talk, but it isn't what ministers of the Word are called to do.From what I know of Jean Cauvin, I don't get the impression that he was about the business of producing an expositional sermon.  Rather, I think his focus was on placarding Christ before Christ's Church so that it could and would intelligently worship the Triune God through the Son and His finished substitutionary work on their behalf.  This Calvin did by carefully and methodically examining the Scriptures in front of his congregation(s).Maybe I missed the author's point.  Maybe this book does see a 1:1 correlation between one's theology and one's preaching. Did I miss it?  If so, the problem is mine and my agenda.Or perhaps, any time we attempt to dissect a frog into its parts and then put all the similar parts together, we run the risk of producing a dead monster rather than understanding the living animal.  If my analogy holds, then maybe the author's intent was to perform an autopsy.  If so, then I should apologize.The real Calvin, from what I have read of his work, was thorough, typically clear-sighted, aware of his detractors, loved his congregation(s) and was (first and foremost) committed to loving God in gratitude for the saving work of Christ on his behalf.  And, because he correctly understood the relationship between the Law and the Gospel, he was also aware that he was a wretched sinner (not just theoretically, but in reality) who was saved by Grace alone both in his justification and in his sanctification.All that being said, if you truly desire to be a ""great"" preacher, don't expect that reading this book will permanently change your life and ministry.  Instead do what Calvin did: dive into a good systematic theology (e.g. Berkhoff), outline the books of the Bible as you read them, memorize lengthy passages of Scripture so that you can meditate on them while you cut the lawn ... and by all means, buy and study a good introduction to logic.Allow me to repeat what you already know - there is no other way to become a ""valuable"" preacher than to devote a few decades to learning Scripture and learning how to think clearly. Don't read about how others excelled at baseball - get out there and get down on your hands and knees so you can taste the clay.",0,0
RP6D0HSREVI4N,"After reading through volumes 1-4 and enjoying them immensely I was looking forward to volume 5. I'll begin with the good and go from there. The arts great. Its a wonderful blend of the moody, atmospheric art seen in previous volumes with distinctive enough edge so that the reader can easily tell whats going on without ruining the flow of the story (Something some of the previous issues had problems with).The story is its biggest flaw by far. A better writer could have condensed this story down to a single action packed issue and tacked it on to volume 4. It's not that the story's bad. It's that its stuck on the fence. I hate to compare different mediums but this feels like Moon Knights 'Spider-man 3'. Its crammed with characters that have zero development. It should have been made long enough to allow the characters to grow or even interact (specifically: Punisher and Toltec) or cut down enough to be used as a prologue in volume 4. As it is, volume 5 is in a no-mans land. It's just long enough to introduce or include a bevy of pointless characters to the plot but not long enough to develop them or even explain their motives. They're just 'there'.Worse than that though is that although some of the Moon Knight boxes have been ticked (Khonshu's admittedly fun and twisted cameos, Marc/Jake's self loathing/boozing) it's just not really Moon Knight. The writer just doesn't seem to get Moon Knight. It's like spiderman trying to be noir or wolverine having a good day. It just doesn't work.2 Stars solely for the Art.",0,0

R1W42JYFWU0JNC,"As a father of three daughters, I want my girls to grow up with a strong sense of self-image, and thus, I’ve become interested in YA fiction that tackles this theme. Since I also enjoy contemporary fantasy, I’m intrigued when the genre is used in a creative way to illustrate the theme. That’s what drew me to this book. Just consider this cool premise:Main character Lola has some body image issues. She feels she’s freakishly tall, awkward, fat, and generally unattractive. She’s teased at her summer camp job and bullied at school. Then without warning, she turns temporarily invisible. Now she can evade the bullies or even enact some revenge upon them, all while learning to love herself.Going in, I was expecting that Lola would experience significant personal growth by the end of the story. It wouldn’t be right for a book about self-esteem to not have that. Without considering that a spoiler by any means, I was pleased that Lola is definitely in a better place at the end of the book. However, I was disappointed by many other aspects—including plot and character elements, as well as overall execution—of the story.For a book with such a strong premise—a character who can turn invisible as a metaphor for not being seen for who she truly is—there was a significant lack of invisibility in the story. She spends very little time in her invisible state, and when she did, wasn’t merely invisible, but also intangible. In many other instances of invisibility of fiction, the character can be heard and felt. Not so here, but I’m not bothered by that because that works in the plot. With her friend Charlie’s help, Lola attempts to learn control over her new power, but very little of this was shown.Also, Lola would learn something new about her power and then tell Charlie or Jon—the boy she crushes over and eventually ends up in instalove with—about it in detail. This caused certain passages and descriptions to be repeated and told rather than shown. The reader learns (is told) that Lola isn’t the only character to have had this power, but its origin is never satisfyingly explained. I’m okay with suspending my disbelief that a character can become invisible, even if by magical reasons, but without an explanation, it reads solely as a plot device.But my biggest issue is with Lola as a narrator. For someone who is teased and bullied, she’s awfully judgmental. Throughout the book, we learn her negative opinions about the appearances and attitudes of her family members, and though her relationship with them is strengthened (abruptly) by the end, her initial feelings toward them make her not as likeable as she could be. At the start of the story, Jon hangs with the kids who bully Lola, and she forgives him far too quickly, which undermines her personal growth and doesn’t set a good example for teen girls.I was hoping for a creative and intriguing take on issues of self-esteem, but unfortunately, most of what I expected wasn’t visible in this book. The premise is clever, but I never felt the stakes tangibly built to a satisfying climax and resolution. Along with too much telling instead of showing, Invisible can only see TWO STARS.",0,0

RV082D1XID6LE,"Don’t get me wrong. I love an alpha hero. but everyone with any power is a man : all the cops, mayors, leaders, bosses (crime and otherwise). It’s tedious. I even checked to see if this had been written in the 90s, it seemed so old fashioned. If not for the presence of the internet and cell phones I would have said it was written in the 80s.Although the Others have powerful females, there are none in leadership positions. The world building is comprehensive but still seems simplistic and has so many holes. Sometimes the Others’ animal natures allow them to figure things out and sometimes they’re clueless - or completely ignore their instincts. For example by  allowing an obviously duplicitous criminal access to their world and beloved heroine - for the sake of plot building. I don’t understand how this writer has been compared to Briggs and Ilona Andrews. There is no comparison. This feels YA in terms of its lack of sophistication and yet, I hate to think of young girls reading these books and seeing no female  leaders and not one single powerful savvy smart human woman. All the ‘good, innocent minded’ girls are being kept as slaves and sexually abused. So gross. Also - on a less intense note: there is a lot of dopey re-naming in this alternate world that is a carbon copy of ours. Weekday names: moonsday and thaisdsy? so creative...Countries: Affrika. Really?

R1M0937EF0AMX8,"I'm a big Lennon fan including his work with The Beatles (of course) and solo work such as ""Plastic Ono Band,"" ""Imagine,"" and ""Double Fantasy"".  Those are, of course, the bookends to his solo career coming in 1970-71 and 1980 and are also the more critically acclaimed Lennon solo albums, but I wanted to dig deeper into the middle period of his solo career, so began looking to this release, ""Mind Games"" and ""Sometime in New York City"".  Of those mid-70's releases from Lennon, the best reviews from critics and fans alike seem to be for this album, ""Walls and Bridges"", though all in all, many critics panned it.  And I hate to say it, but... those critics may have been right.I tend to judge an album I purchase from many years ago on two things:  first, how many well-known songs that I already know and like does it have?  If an album has 3-4 songs I've already heard and know I like, chances are pretty good I will enjoy that album.  And second, how good are the rest of the songs that I've not yet heard?  As for the known songs, there is of course the hit ""Whatever Gets You Through The Night,"" which is Lennon's first #1 solo single, but far from his best in my opinion.  Not a bad song, but one Lennon himself describes as a bit of silly fun and nothing more, and I tend to agree.  Not that there's anything wrong with a bit of fun, but that's generally not what I turn to Lennon for, so that song is just not much of an anchor for a great album to me.Then there is ""#9 Dream"" which also seems to be a fan favorite, but not so much for me.  Again, not a bad song, but on the list of Lennon's greatest solo achievements, this one is well down there for me because the sound of it is very echoey and over-produced, with Lennon's voice buried in the production.  I had hoped that was just a feature of this particular song, where the subject matter (a dream Lennon had) might at least half-way justify the rather blurry and unclear mix of sound (was Lennon trying to project the haziness of the dream he was writing about, perhaps?).  Sadly though, the bulk of the rest of the album is bogged down by the same production techniques and misplaced horns that only serve to bury the song Lennon has written.  Maybe this is a result of Lennon being less confident with the material and/or his singing at this ""lost weekend"" point of his career, but it just doesn't help the songs.  In the liner notes, this album is described as John's ""starkest"" work after only ""Plastic Ono Band"", and lyrically, that may be true as he was clearly adrift, but the lyrics are unfortunately lost in the production of this album which is anything BUT ""stark"".As for the songs themselves, the one I was most looking forward to was ""Nobody Loves You When You're Down and Out"" because I had heard the `demo' version of this song from the ""Wonsaponatime"" cd (which is a sampler of the Lennon Anthology box set) and absolutely loved it.  It would fit right on ""Plastic Ono Band"" or ""Imagine"" which are generally considered to be Lennon's 2 best solo releases, so I fully expected the finished version here to  be an instant favorite of mine, but... not so.  Instead the song is buried in the same production as much of the rest of the album with a horn section and echoey vocals literally ruining this great song.  Hearing how great this song sounds on ""Wonsaponatime"" compared to the dismal finished product here makes me wish I'd saved my money and bought the ""Anthology"" box set instead.""What You Got"" is a decent piece of Lennon getting a little funky with a syncopated rhythm accented by horns, but despite a very powerful and impassioned delivery, I find the lyrics a bit trite and simplistic for someone of Lennon's stature (""You don't know what ya got, until you lose it"".  Really? Is this already-known universal truth worth making into a song?).""Steel and Glass"" has already been mentioned in many reviews as a highlight.  Lennon himself has called it ""son of ""How Do You Sleep?"""", and therein lies the problem:  it's a virtual knockoff and I dare say if another artist had done ""Steel and Glass,"" Lennon would have a case for plagiarism.  As it stands, this passes as a highlight on ""Walls and Bridges"", but I can't listen to it without hearing the superior ""How Do You Sleep?"", so... this just doesn't do it for me either.But, it's not all bad news:  semi-bright spots include ""Going Down On Love"" and the bluesy ""Old Dirt Road""; ""Bless You"" and ""Scared"" are two of the better songs as well, but even those don't quite call out for an immediate repeat listen the way well over half the cuts did on ""Plastic Ono Band"" and ""Imagine"".In summary, much as I love John Lennon, I would give this album a very tepid 2.5 stars which I'm rounding down to 2 stars to offset some of the other reviews here that I think are just too generous.If you're after Lennon's ""hits"" from this album, I would recommend the ""Legend"" compilation first because it contains both ""Whatever Gets You Through The Night"" and ""#9 Dream"" plus non-album singles like ""Instant Karma!"", ""Cold Turkey,"" ""Give Peace A Chance"" and the Christmas favorite ""Happy XMAS (War Is Over)"" plus other outstanding cuts from Lennon's solo years that make that CD a much better listen than ""Walls and Bridges"".  If you have the Lennon ""hits"" but want more, be sure you have ""Plastic Ono Band,"" ""Imagine"" and ""Double Fantasy"" before this one as those are all superior albums compared to this one.  This album isn't horrible, but it's darn close to being designated ""For completists only"".",0,0

I promised to myself, since I was a kid at the time (still am), that I would read his adult novels when I grew up someday. A few years later, the first Theodore Boone novel came out, and I, as a kid, was instantly drawn to it. I thought, perhaps I wouldn't have to wait that long to read a Grisham novel! And then I read it, and it ended on a cliffhanger, so of course I wanted the second one. When the second one came out, I raced to the library. I read it. And I was so, so, disappointed.Now, I do not claim to know John Grisham's works very well, since, as I stated before, I am a teenager. However, I do know enough that John Grisham is apparently the master of the legal thriller. After reading these three novels in the Theodore Boone series, I have trouble believing that.Why? Well, the first one was fine. It was short and kind of incomplete, but it had some nice Law-and-Order style drama. Why was I disappointed by the second one? Because it had nothing to do with the first one. This third book in the series faces the same problem.The second one focused on a kidnapping. This one focuses on a robbery. But that isn't the reason why I'm so annoyed. The reason is, HE IS NOT FOCUSING ON THE PETE DUFFY MURDER TRIAL. Sure, in the beginning of the book, there's a bit of tension with him. But that's it. Like in The Abduction, Duffy is pushed off to the side and completely forgotten about.Mr. Grisham has to realize that what draws people to his books are the courtroom aspect of it. Perhaps he thinks that with young children, who are the people this book is marketed to, he can get away with delaying it, putting it off; perhaps he even thinks this ramps up the suspense. But it's not working. Just think of it this way: if you heard about Theodore Boone: Kid Lawyer and knew you would have to wait two, possibly three more years for the conclusion to it, would you want to read it? If you knew, the author was going to write filler novel after filler novel in the series, not advancing the plot he started in the first book, would you want to read it?I'll be counting how many books it takes for Mr. Grisham to return to what I started reading Theodore Boone for. I'll be counting how many books it takes for him to realize that changing the subject pointlessly in this series is not what we want. I'll be counting how many books it takes for him to write about the darned Pete Duffy murder trial again. I'll be counting.-reviewed by a teenager.

R3DSJ3LQEQ9GQS,"This was probably my least favorite Nora Roberts standalone in YEARS. I was a little worried after the oddness that was YEAR ONE, but this actually turned out even worse than I expected. It took literally TWO HUNDRED PAGES before the romance in this romance novel started. Literally 200 pages before the two main characters met more than for a moment where they both saw each other in the aftermath of the initial starting tragedy. I wish I was exaggerating, but I doublechecked the page count when I got ready to post this review.The other issue was that there was no surprise or mystery really AT ALL. We knew the identity (and had a ton of time in their POV) almost from the start, and said baddie was not remotely relatable, and the more we spent time in their POV, the more I wanted to just toss the book away.Once the romance finally got going, it was a little easier to read, and as always I did love the way Nora wrote the family relationships and CeCe was a delight.

I was really looking forward to reading it, but as another reviewer commented, there is so much filler, that the substance is lost.Especially the chapter about mediums, there are pages and pages of wadding (written) about a bit of wadding (muslin)!The space would've been better used discussing other mediums. Britain boasts several. It is an American book, but since a fair bit of research was done in the UK, Roach could've mentioned the 2 Dorises (Stokes, Collins).There are omissions - why mention John Edward so briefly? Those of us outside the U.S especially, don't know as much about him as U.S. residents might. And if he's so famous, why not interview him?And why nothing about spirit-, or automatic-writing?What information was there was buried in amusing but overlong and over-frequent character/physical descriptions of those around the author.There was far too much history - I'd rather have read about what's going on the modern day re. spiritualism and the paranormal.Basically, it seems like after the success of ""Stiff"" Roach was commissioned to write a similar book with a quirky one-word title about a freaky subject (which, as she admits somewhere in the acknowledgements, she knew nothing about!).I wonder whether she actually had any interest in it to begin with...",0,0

R1KANLLN0BZ17J,"One of the earlier reviewers pointed this out, but I want to amplify the comment.  One of the reasons we buy expensive vinyl is for the form factor itself - we want the excellence of a physical record.  This album from the Czech Republic is mastered at the wrong speed.  When played at 33rpm it slow-w-w-w-s the music down and drags the pitch down with it.  It sounds better for pitch when played at 45 rpm, but I don't trust that the pitch is true to life and, if you understand the physics of a needle tracking in a groove, the faster the platter spins, the worse it is for accuracy of reproduction.

If he would have spent a little time researching the history of Islam, the political system of the Ottoman Empire, the complicated history of western and eastern empire building, invasion and broken promises going back to the Crusades it could have been a 5 star book. The author decided to portray the Barbary coast in an over-simplistic way  in order to paint them as cartoonish ""bad guys"". Nothing in history is black and white and putting in a little time  into exploring the other sides point-of-view would have added to the authors credibility.

R1ZRSATRUV73Q5,"George Sand was a precocious French writer during the 19th century. However Sand was another person entirely. Born as Amantine Lucille Aurore Dupin to a French courtesan and Maurice Dupin, though she was raised by her grandmother on her estate of Nohant in the province of Berry. Married at eighteen to Casimir Dudevant she gave birth to two children, the second possibly not his, before she left for Paris to pursue her dreams, before legally separating from her husband four years later. There she became an accomplished writer, though she was forced to publish under the pseudonym she came to use in her daily life. She was equally well known for her ostentatious behavior which included dressing like a man, smoking cigars, several prominent affairs, one of which was rumored to be with a woman.That description there was about as interesting as anything I read in the book. It was a slow, dull recitation of Sand's life, mostly focused on her love affairs, though without any emotional impact. Sand is a fascinating subject, with a wealth of material to draw upon. I cannot fathom how was possible to make this story so boring. My only guess is that the author was attempting to pace the book to match the era. Regardless of the reason, this book was a complete failure, which I found incredibly difficult to finish.I have read other books by this author, books that I enjoyed greatly. I commend her effort to write this book as Sand is a fascinating person who lived an interesting life, but it is my suggestion that Berg stick to contemporary novels and leave the historical fiction to others. This book had little to offer in way of enjoyment, and I cannot say I recommend it at all.***I received a galley of this novel in exchange for an honest review.***",0,0

RWETQD0G6V373,"Revolutions disappoints me the most of the three movies.  I am writing this for fellow sci-fi fans, and for myself, to briefly analyze the question - why the formula in the sequels do not work as well as the original Matrix.  So I'm mainly reviewing the movie in the 3-part series, not the DVD.All three main characters - Neo, Trinity and Morpheus - in Reloaded and Revolutions, are just too lifeless, aside from the obvious, that there is a departure from the story for the sake of big budget effects (Hey, I love well-made fx, don't get me wrong!)  Or is it just bad acting?  (I know, I know. They were supposed to be computerized.)  I'll tell you what I think is the culprit - those darn sunglasses.  Acting is in the eyes, and if you can't see the eyes, out goes the expression.  Why do they have to wear the sunglasses underground, also?  Fashion?  Who cares about looking cool when the whole world is coming to an end!  For argument sake, look back at the original Matrix.  Neo and Trinity were newbies and fresh, trying to solve the puzzle - how to save humanity.  There was more self-discovery in the ""real"" world, on board the Neberknezzer (mispelled, huh).  Neo, Trinity and Morpheus were not so busy trying to look cool as in the sequels.  Believe or not, my favorite character is the Oracle.  Even though she has a small part, she is the only one I care about the most.  She possesses a lot of spunk for a matrix concontion.  Too bad, the original actress, is not in Revolutions, because of her unfortunate, untimely death in real life.  (Did you catch the irony of what she eats in Reloaded?)  Revolutions take place 100% underground or in a very cloudy world, so you vampires will feel at home.  The Sentinals vs. the human machines is worth a look-see, but the Super Burly Brawl is not as fun to watch as before because the bad weather makes it hard to see.  I just wish Mr. Smith and Neo had chosen to slap-each-other-silly on a day that wasn't raining.  As a grand finale, the ending is convoluted, leaving more questions than answers.  It leaves an unsatisfactory feeling in my stomach, kind of like amusement park food.  As tragic as the story is going, The Wachowski Brothers sell out by slapping on a hollywood-like ending.  Sunny skies and all.If you don't care about the story that much, but want amazing visuals, I would recommend Reloaded over Revolutions.  The martial arts choreography, with weapons, this time, is amazing.  And the highway scene is unsurpassable.  However, if you can only afford one DVD in this series, and you want the best, get the first Matrix.  (Now, I have to figure out why George Lucas messed up the prequels.  Jar Jar...

R3SUE1LRRA6QB1,"As a decent Panic fan, I was hoping to enjoy this album. I knew it wouldn't be modern like their 2016 release, Death of a Bachelor, but I was hoping it would be good. I expected something a little more punk-y and emo-rock esque, like early Fall out Boy. (Both bands went in similar directions while becoming more mainstream.) What I got was... actually really immature. This music is kind of like Fall out Boy, except with more of a Las Vegas theme, but if you want an album that has a much better Las Vegas theme, get Too Weird to Live, too Rare to Die! A lot of the songs on this album have no purpose to have been recorded than to just exist. And if that's not bad enough, there are stupid references to other, better songs, like that Sound of Music reference in the closing track. I'm just glad these guys have matured since this release. But it does have its moments, and is not terrible overall. It's just the weakest Panic album so far.I'm going to do a track-by-track review so I can explain every aspect of the album in good detail. Also, no one ever does these kinds of reviews anymore.1. Introduction (0:37): I can't really review this, because it's not really much of a song. There's just some rustling in the background, and an instrumental that leads into the first song. (5/10)And speaking of the next song...2. The Only Difference Between Martyrdom and Suicide Is Press Coverage (2:54): Okay, right away, you'll notice that most of the tracks on this album have ridiculously long titles that have nothing to do with the actual lyrics. This is one of those. At TEN freakin' words, that's at least a little unnecessary. But this one is actually pretty good. It's a little moving, and the lyrics are okay. The guitar work is also pretty good. (8/10)3. London Beckoned Songs About Money Written By Machines (3:23): Of all the tracks on this album, this is probably the most Fall out Boy-esque. It's really rockin' and fun. The only thing is that the lyrics are immature, but these guys just got out of high school, so that's justifiable. (8/10)4. Nails For Breakfast, Tacks For Snacks (3:23): This is one of the weakest tracks on the album. The lyrics aren't very good, the tune is really forgettable, and it also has a stupid title! (3/10)5. Camisado (3:11): Meh. It sounds like they're trying to be quotable with this one, but it just wasn't that great. Also, I have no idea what that title means. At least it's only one word. (5/10)6. Time To Dance (3:22): Actually, no, it's not time to dance. The tune is really generic and forgettable, and the lyrics are stupid. Only Panic would say ""I say shotgun, you say wedding"" in the chorus. The only real plus is that the guitar work is really good! (5/10)7. Lying Is The Most Fun A Girl Can Have Without Taking Her Clothes Off (3:20): Boring, but passable. And 14 words! At least it's much more mature than the other tracks. This kind of reminds me of TWTLTRTD. (6/10)8. Intermission (2:35): It's all right. I can see this being a good intermission song, if not for the ending. It's a bit more techo-y than the other tracks. (6/10)9. But It's Better If You Do (3:25): Boring... bland... immature... I've already said everything there is to say about this while describing every other song. The singing is good, at least. (7/10)10. I Write Sins Not Tragedies (3:06): This is another one of those ones that I actually liked. It's really satisfying after you hear the whole thing, especially if you're a bit grumpy. Even the lyrics aren't that bad. They show signs of immaturity, sure, but they're okay. The only problem is that they had a swear word in the chorus. That always annoys me, because if you're going to swear in a song, do you have to do it after every verse? Otherwise a good track. (9/10)11. I Constantly Thank God For Esteban (3:30): I can't review this song, because I forgot about it. It's very forgettable. Also, another long title. (4/10)12. There's A Good Reason These Tables Are Numbered Honey, You Just Haven't Thought Of It Yet (3:16): Whoa! I know I was complaining about these songs having long titles, but at 16 honking words, this one has got to be the longest of them all! But as far as the actual song goes... it's okay. It has more of a big band feel to it, which fits the theme of the album well. (7/10)13. Build God, Then We'll Talk (3:40): This is probably the best track on the album. There are a bunch of different tempos that it changes over in the span of 3.5 minutes. The guitar work, and cello work, are really good. And unlike a lot of the other tracks on this album, it's actually really catchy. My only real complaints are the lyrics. The title makes you think that it's about building god, but it's actually about... having a bad experience at a hotel, I think? And like I said at the beginning, there's an unnecessary Sound of Music reference. But overall, it's actually really good. (9/10)And there you have it, Panic's first album... and it's not that great. If you want a better emo-punk album, get an early Fall out Boy album. And if you want a better Panic album, get Pretty. Odd, Vices & Virtues (I don't have these yet, but they sound good), TWTLTRTD, Death of a Bachelor, or any other album.

R3DLZQ87IOMWMP,"Most negative reviewers of this album appear to be people who have no inclination to like it anyway, regardless of its actual content: heavy metal fans, people who have no taste for light rock, and scorned Radiohead fanboys. So, seeing that my rating for this album is as low as it is, you'd expect me to belong to one of the above camps; quite to the contrary, however, I long held ""A Rush of Blood to the Head"" to be one of the best albums I had ever heard, and eagerly anticipated this follow-up. All of the former being said, however, I found ""X&Y"" to be quite possibly the most disappointing artistic accomplishment that I've ever experienced.It's almost impossible to talk about the majority of the tracks on an individual basis, as they so closely resemble one another in their dull, vague lyrics and monotonous, repetitive melodies. More than once, I would often check my CD player to see if I had accidentally hit ""repeat"" and was listening to a previous track. While I will refrain from an exhaustive comparison of the two albums, and thereby expose a bias that I do not have towards wishing this album to sound like the band's former work, ""X&Y"" seems to be attempting to achieve a similar status as ""A Rush"", an album that was melancholy and remorseful while simultaneously being pleasantly retrospective and uplifting. The main difference between the two is that ""X&Y"" is much more depressing and quiet in tone. I would be open to this stylistic feel if it was executed in such a way that was moving and, most importantly, interesting. Instead, the band takes the idea of ""less is more"" to such an extreme that they delude any substance or message that exists in the music. Lyrically, the album is a just a collection of pre-suicidal, clinically depressed anecdotes and generic philosophical ponderings that mirror the emptiness of the narrative. Musically, the music follows suit, coming across as quite bland for all of the band's obvious ambition. Bluntly, the music and the lyrics just...are. Period. Nothing more, nothing less.Of course, that's not to say that every single track on the album follows suit with the aforementioned pattern: there are the stand-out songs that up my overall rating a star. While it does tend to get old, partially due to its being overplayed on the radio and the video subsequently being shown constantly on television, ""Speed of Sound"" is nevertheless a very well-crafted, melodically and lyrically inspiring song in the style of ""Clocks."" Like the band's previous single, its meaning is ambiguous, yet it still manages to soar musically. More impressive is ""Fix You"", the underrated and underplayed second single off of the album. A truly moving tale of the narrator's attempts to console a loved one, the song builds from delicate piano and sincerely soft vocals to a multiple harmony finale featuring the voices of the entire band, complete with a great and memorable guitar riff that perfectly compliments the song's gentle tone. It's certainly not an accident that the sole two good songs from the album became its first two promotional singles; it almost appears as if the record company knew that the other tracks would never sell the album if mainstream audiences heard them on the radio. Of course, then again, they did release the tepid ""Talk"" as the album's third single, the epitome of the nothingness of ""X&Y"", so I could be wrong.Plain and simple, this album is disappointing on an epic level and not worth buying or downloading, even for free. I would recommend getting ""Speed of Sound"" and ""Fix You"" separately and skipping all of the other hollow attempts at songwriting on this bomb.",0,0

R28CKV3CH4H4G5,"I agree with most of the other reviewers who have given this book a poor rating.  Yes, it is impressive that the author wrote the book at such an early age.  As it stands, though, the book is little more than a (very) rough draft.  It is also very derivative and unintentionally humorous, as other reviewers have noted.  The narrative structure is generally poor, as are also some of the author's techniques: frequently spelling out the protagonist's thoughts, providing history lessons via a storyteller without song, or assigning names to places from some fictitious language without actually developing that language (better to assign descriptive or evocative names in English, then).  If I had read this book when I was a kid, I might have overlooked some of these problems and enjoyed it nonetheless.  Probably, many kids are doing that now.  However, the book will definitely have very limited appeal for adults who have a taste for well-crafted, original fantasy.",0,0

R243E800SLTBD6,"This book have a good ending (2-3 chapters) and i think there is 2 maybe 3 chapters that grasps your interesest but its really bad.People like me listen and read Syfi to dream away in other galaxies and stars with the dream of new technology, new races and exploration. We all are dreamers looking for the future, but this book is beyond repair. They talk just about human politics. Not any politics, but in a imaginary world with imaginary people in space. Real life politics are difficult and boring in it self, pleas dear writer. I wasted maybe 7 of 8 hours listening to this book. Dull space politics - its amazing how non interesting this book was. crazy bad from editor letting this book go without demanding more dept and juice from the writer. Editors with no spine that is probably a big fan of the writer. Pleas help this bad book become great. With small tweaks of cool technology and mystery this book/seriers could be great. Put in touch of alien twist in the beginning or a ship/planet that found a alien artifact that makes people want to fight for it. ANYTHING more than human politics in space. More about faster than light tec. ANYTHING.The point of this revue is to tell the writer and editor to wake up.Book deserves 1 star.",0,0
R3GZ30CZVD94CK,"I had to read this book for a college, Chinese History class. I still remember how 'ethnocentric' it is. He bragged about how he could beat these poor, backward, malnourished Chinese people in a foot race. I guess he didn't forsee that the Chinese would sweep the Beijing Olympics with an astonishing amount of medals. He also talked about 'Chinese propaganda signs' as if his culture didn't have anti-smoking commercials and other various forms of 'propaganda'. Really, this book was written by an angry 20 some thing year old who cared more about puffing up his own ego than any kind of deep understanding  of a foreign culture.  It's just a shame that this guy had a successful  career as a journalist. The fact that this book was so popular shows the tribe state of journalism and intellectuallism in the usa.

It seemed every couple of minutes there was something about how this guy wants to have sex with this other guy but doesn't want to admit it.

In fact people in the foreground are so dark that this product is useless.  This DoorPeepwhole Video camera has a very nice looking box and image of  a sales person knocking on the door, but that is BIG MISREPRESENTATION on Brinno's side.  Reality is very different.

On regular camera's this feature is called ""exposure compensation""And secondly invest little extra and make video higher quality.  Than this product will sell.",0,0

Horrible smell4. minor test improvementI'm in my late 30s and have experience taking an expensive mailorder brand that cost twice as much in the past.  That brand absolutely worked so I know I what it feels like when a test supplement is working. I wanted to try something else because I was spending $100s on this other brand and wanted to see if cheaper stuff would work.I experienced massive headaches and was unable to sleep with these.. Sometimes trouble falling asleep sometimes waking up in the middle of the night with a migraine and completely dehydrated. I really wanted to see if it would go away so I completed the whole bottle sometimes only taking 3 pills. During the month some nights the headaches would come and go.The smell of the pills are disgusting. One reviewer said they smell like Chinese food and I thought he was being dramatic. They actually do, but worse. Like sweet funky stale Chinese food. You would not want to kiss anyone after taking these, just opening the bottle made my bathroom stink for hours (not kidding) and you can smell it in your breath the next day. I don't know why they don't put these in Gelcaps like other companies.As for results, I would say I felt maybe %15 more test in my system so I guess they do something but nothing compared to the other brand I used in the past.  When I'm not on test I have almost no labido, energy , don't want to work out.  For me when a Test supplement is working my libido shoots up like I'm a teen, no ED issues, and I want to just start doing push ups all the time,  So I can say that taking natural supplements do work, however, I would not recommend these at all. I gave 2 stars because I did feel a slight improvement but not worth it with the side effects. If it was not for the side effects and stink I would say paying half as much for half the results make sense and maybe I would continue using them.",0,0
R1YSECH4MR33ET,"I too have to join the host of 1-star reviews, pains me as it does, due the previous brilliant James Herbert titles, I am a huge fan. But this book (did it really take years to write?) fell well short of the mark.Maybe my initial expectations were off point, but seeing as this book saw the return of the much loved character David Ash, and the book was self titled ""Ash"", I'm sure my expectations were correct, and it was just a bad book. My expectations being that this would really explore the charater of David more. I have to say the book started promisingly, it spoke of his alcoholism, and bad previous experiences (in ""Haunted"" and ""Ghosts of Sleath""), but did the book help him, develop him? No, it took him nowhere; he still drinks, takes medication now, oh but this time his girlfriend survived.Maybe if this book was half the size, the lack of content wouldnt seem so bad. But the first 40% (yes i'm on kindle), Ash accepted the job, had a plane journey, and a car journey...that's it! 300approx. pages before he's even reached the estate. The reader is then suddenly faced with a whole host of weird characters (serial killer, incestuous siblings, secret lesbian lovers), all of which you hardly see again, or take the story anywhere; all irrelevant to any hauntings, which is the reason we all read JH.Overall the book just felt so padded out.

R2AC3GXJUTRMTO,"When I was at school, we were made to read a book called ""The Dark is Rising"". I thought that was the worst book I'd ever read, and it held it's title for a long time (I'm 27 now) - but compared to the Tao of Pooh it shines like a glimmering beacon of success in the puss filled mire of Hoff's seemingly limitless inadequacy as a writer.Unfortunately, Amazon.com won't allow me to put less than one star, but given the choice I'd rate this book in minus figures.What I'm going to suggest though, is that if you are an intelligent person, please do read this book so that you may contribute along with me in diminishing the completely unjustified acclaim it holds.At the end of this book, I understand very little about Taoism, as I would hope that it is vastly more interesting and holds less prejudice and small-mindedness as Hoff suggests. If anything, the book is far more representational of facist and racist views. To suggest that knowledgeable people, or people who strive to gain knowledge are stupid in their quest, is quite frankly ludicrous.The book is basically saying, if you're thick and stupid and have limited room for thought, if you only look for simple things because you're too incompetent to strive to achieve, then you'll be happy.

RT4CFIS8IAD4X,"I have mixed feelings about this book. I started eating clean about 3 months ago and have dropped 24 lbs doing it my way (eating when I'm hungry, stopping when I'm satisfied, exercising regularly), and decided to give this interesting concept of ""restarting"" my metabolism a shot. The food and principles themselves are not the issue. The amount of food she requires you to eat is what bothers me. That isn't natural, and if you do it her way, it isn't what your body is telling you to do. Shoveling down several cups of spinach as well as 8 ounces of protein in one setting (however delicious they may be) stretches your stomach, which sets you up for overeating at your next meal, and whether or not the food is clean or ""dirty"", overeating is NEVER the answer to losing weight or resetting anything in your body.I like her recipes and I like how she incorporates grains and fruits, but overall, the promise of making you skinny by ""DOING EXACTLY THIS"" isn't going to work for everyone.

Why this music is popular is beyond me.  She cannot sing (if she could, there would be no need for the way-over-the-top studio production).  Also, there would be no need to resort to the ""bad girl"" image that she so desperately (and pathetically) holds onto these days.  Who loves her?  Teeny-bopper girls who wish they could be her, and pre- (and current) pubescent boys who wish they could get to ""know"" her.Britney does not have an ounce of originality.  Everything she has done, has already been done before.  Madonna was the first with the sexy bad girl/tramp image--although Cher was (and still is) the only original, pure DIVA who led the way for everyone (Madonna included) for her continuous re-invention.All I can say to Britney is, cash it in NOW as best as you can, while you have your hot looks--which is obviously what you are doing.  Because I seriously, seriously doubt that your ""staying power"" is going to go much past 2005.  With American pop music lovers being as fickle as they are, count yourself lucky to have had a career as long as you have.  Trust me, artists with the longevity of Cher are truly one of a kind.

R16ISBOEKJT2ZN,"""Trickster's Queen"" continues the story of Alianne, daughter of Alanna and George Cooper, as she struggles to put a raka queen on the throne of the Copper Isles.Although I enjoyed ""Trickster's Choice"" very much, this book did not live up to the promise of the first volume.  The deterioration of Sarai's character into a mindless idiot was very disappointing, as was the convenient way in which Ms. Pierce disposed of the other children.  Far too much of the book was spent on the mechanics of spying, which, though interesting, did not serve to drive either plot or character development in any significant way.  I also prefer my evil characters to have  bit more nuance.  One of her most awful villains (in Cold Fire) is the more awful for the small amount of empathy he evokes.Aly, also, did not seem to suffer from any sort of moving transformation - her conflicts were just not that believable, especially compared to Alanna's struggles over her relationship with Jonathan, or Keladry's grief and anger in ""Lady Knight.""

I like the concept and because of this book I have decided to cut out soda and as much processed food as is practical, and cut back on desserts and such. So yes, it has helped me out. Also, I would have to say that I have gleaned some very useful information from this book, and that some of her statements have prompted me to do more research on my own into the dangerous world of eating too much sugar, particularly fructose. HOWEVER, I am sad to say that I found some of what she said conflicting (i.e., it almost sounded like she didn't want you to touch sugar during week 3-8, but then almost all of her recipes are sweetened and at times throughout the book it almost sounds like she is okay with things that I would have thought would be forbidden during the detox period.) This book has just confused me and I don't feel as though it is clear and logical, making it hard to follow.In summary: Yes, the reading of this book has prompted me to make my own discoveries about sugar and educate myself more thoroughly on the subject of what I put in my body, which is a very good thing. However, I had trouble following Sarah Wilson's intent throughout the book and so ended up creating my own guidelines and choosing recipes from Sally Fallon's Nourishing Traditions (a book that I wholeheartedly recommend to anyone who is serious about their health!) Also, the recipes in ""I Quit Sugar"" are, for the most part, unappetizing to me. I realize that all tastes differ, so take that as you will.

R13UKHKMPVZEK3,"The problem with this prequel, or almost ANY prequel for that matter, is that, while working to fill in backstory for the fans, the fans already have an idea of how things will turn out in order to lead up to the  original series, thereby giving no real payoff within the prequel itself -  the story, therefore, is very paint-by-numbers.In order to attact the  attention of new readers, however, another disservice is done: ""House  Attreides"" is written in a simplistic fashion to provide new readers  with essential info, and this insults the intelligence of those who have  followed the original series.After reading this story, I shudder to  think that someone may mistakenly begin reading the Dune series with  ""House Attreides"" instead of ""Dune"".  I would never  recommend this book to a newcomer OR a long-time Frank Herbert fan.  It is  too simplistically written, and I agree with a prior reviewer who stated  that it was written on the same level as Kevin Anderson's ""Young  Jedi"" series.  This book is not mature nor challenging; it doesn't  have near the heart or ambition of the original series.The most  irritating point of the book for me is how it is peppered with the  characters wondering about the secret of the spice.  Well, any fan of  ""Dune"" knows the answer, and while this is designed to give a  sense of plot development to new readers, this technique is pretty cheesy  and falls flat on its face for fans.On one hand, I can't believe that  the story of Dune would be polluted with this mess.

He doesn't want to be judged but makes fun of others and judges everyone else; but still within 2 days bimbo falls in love with misunderstood and sees the goodness there?! The situation that brings these two together starts off interestingly enough but then spirals into ridiculous and unbelievable actions from several characters in the book. Seems more like a lovesick 14 year old wrote this book rather than an adult woman, however, this may be kind of harsh toward the 14 year old! If you are paying any kind of attention you will know who the real villain by no more than a third of the way into the book, at most. Once you know this it is easy to know what is going to happen and twists are taken away. A completely mindless read.I just realized that I meant to write this review for a different Sandra Brown book, ""Sting"", however, doesn't really matter, the basic plot is almost exactly the same and this review also pertains to this book as well!A much better Sandra Brown book that does not follow the same old plot line is Envy.  Wish she'd write more of these.",0,0

RLBDZS1VKMSX5,"This is the absolute worst book I've read in my entire life! And I've read some pretty awful books. My main squabbles with this book:1) as everybody has mentioned, the story-line has been totally copied off of waaayyy better books.2) as everyone else has mentioned, the names are totally copied of off waaayyy better books.3) the descriptions were of absolutley everything but Eragon. And the descriptions were a total waste of time. He wasted a whole 2 pages describing to the finest detail a map of Middle Earth--oops, Alagaesia that the readers could have seen by flipping back a few pages (most of which were filled with unnecessary descriptions).4)as another reviewer has mentioned, Eragon looks a bit like Paolini. Arya, Eragon's love interest, looks a lot like Liv Tyler. Coincidence? I think NOT!!5) the ""ancient language"" was horriffic. there were too many consanants jumbled together. Example: brsingr. I did NOT make that word up! Some words from the Urgal language was taken straight out of Tolkien's Orkish dialect.6) The Urgals are no more than stupid cavemen with horns and we are constantly being TOLD how evil they are, yet we never SEE how evil they are. Quite unlike Tolkiens perfectly sinister orcs.7) Because of the way Brom talks about Eragon's mother, it makes it seem as though Brom is Eragon's father. But it would be hilarious if Galbatorix/Darth Vader/Evil Emperor/Sauron was his father. Example: ""'No, Eragon!' stated Galbatorix misteriously. 'I am your father!' 'NOOO!' wailed Eragon piteously.""8) Paolini's fear of the word said. I can't recall ever reading the word said in the entire book! Plus, he'll use an adverb describing exactly how Eragon asked. For example: ""How?"" inquired Eragon, curiously. Quite unnecessary. I nearly threw the book across the room when I read ""Sorry,"" apologized Brom.9) did it ever occur to Paolini that not every single sword has a name? And it would be impossible for a guy to be able to hold a one-handed 5 foot sword. The sword was described as being ""rather heavy."" Real swords were not really heavy, nor were they five foot long. Even the great Claymores were no more than four feet long, and weighed little more than four pounds.10) his knowlegde of battle tatics seemed to be learned solely from watching the LOTR movies. But the fight scene isn't half that good. It is all told from Eragon's point of view. And he seems to be able to have time, in the mist of fighting horribly dnagerous Urgals, to look around and watch what all the named characters in the book are doing, before turning around and fighting an unsuspecting orc--I'm sorry, Urgal.Another thing is the way people give him slack for being so young. PLEASE! It only got published for two reasons:1) his parent's were publishers and thought that there son was a genius. They would of published any thing he wrote.2) he met the Random House editor on a book tour and became friends. She promised to get his book published if he wanted.I could go on, but I won't.

R1IDO9UYHVGVVX,"Dan Simmons needs an editor.  There is no reason this book should be pushing 600 pages.  Rambling, unfocused, and way too much bathroom humor for my tastes.  The book would make a great Hollywood movie, since Simmons seems unable to take on subject matter more complex than the standard disenfranchised sexually-fixated everyman facing massive physical and emotional exertion with typical sentimental overtones.  The quality metaphors that might make us care more about Ilium's plot and characters are lacking.  Padding its shortcomings with derivative material is another offensive element.  However, my only saving graces for having taken two weeks of free time to read Ilium is that I enjoyed the recitations of Shakespeare and Proust, and the Homer refresher was appreciated, but even that ultimately feels as empty as the banal film Troy, recently in theaters.

R19ZVXQ3E0LNWU,"1.5/10 starsTen years ago, who would've guessed that emo would usurp punk as the genre du jour for angst-ridden teens. By the late 1990s, most fans of the genre's second wave were abandoning it. Many of the best bands had split up, while the handful that were left were moving toward a more straightforward pop rock sound. But just as it appeared over, the scene suddenly exploded, giving birth to an entire new generation of slick, generic, mall-store neo-emo. It's like the bartender yelled last call, the house lights came on, and then at the last minute, he decided to keep the club open all night serving Cokes. So now, 20 years after Rites of Spring's only full-length album was released, we've arrived at Panic! at the Disco's A Fever You Can't Sweat Out.Where does one begin to describe this steaming pile of garbage? You've already seen the ridiculous name, so let's try a few of song titles on for size. Track two is called ""The Only Difference Between Martyrdom and Suicide Is Press Coverage"", and it's followed by ""London Beckoned Songs About Money Written By Machines"". If those don't quite do it for you, check out ""I Write Sins Not Tragedies"", or my personal favorite, ""Lying Is the Most Fun a Girl Can Have Without Taking Her Clothes Off"".But of course, the asinine song titles and the moronic band name have nothing on the actual songs. The usual guitar, bass, and drums are augmented by drum machine beats and synths that would be more at home blaring over the P.A. at your local gym than in anything one might consider enjoyable music. The production, handled by Matt Squire, a guy who is certainly no stranger to radio-friendly emo, is slick and polished. Vocalist Brendon Urie's impassioned, warbling vocals are so strained it's as if he might just burst into tears at any moment. This poor guy's heart must get broken on a daily basis or something. And if it wasn't bad enough, someone convinced him to add some fancy effects on a track or two that make it sound like someone is lightly karate chopping him across the throat while he sings.The lyrics are just the sort of vague teen heartache you'd expect. In ""Camisado"", Urie croons, ""You're a regular decorated emergency/ The bruises and contusions will remind you what you did when you wake,"" sliding up to a falsetto while keyboards shimmer behind him. In ""Time to Dance"", which utilizes some sort of poorly realized gun-as-a-camera metaphor, he belts out, ""When I say shotgun, you say wedding/ Shotgun/ Wedding"", and ""Give me envy/ Give me malice/ Give me attention/ Give me a break."" Yeah, you and me both, kid.It's sad that this is what emo has become. The genre's always had some irritating characteristics, but this newest batch of heartbroken heartthrobs has managed to build their careers solely out of those characteristics. The whining, the emotionally exposed lyrics, and the passionate choruses are there, but there's no sincerity, creativity, or originality. [1.5/10 stars]-Cory D.

R3SK79HRVX50G1,"I received this watch about a month ago, and I really liked it.  It worked well, looked nice and was very comfortable.  I've worn it almost constantly since I got it.  However, about two weeks ago while on a trip and swimming in about three feet of water, the watch leaked and got water in the face.  Water that will not come out no matter what I do.  Which is rather frustrating as this watch is supposed to be fit for recreational scuba diving.  But apparently that doesn't mean much.  This in itself normally would not incite me to write a one star review, however, I have been trying to get into contact with Invicta for over a week to get the watch serviced with no success.  No one has responded to my multiple emails, I try to call and there is an almost hour wait time to talk to a representative.  What a joke.

R7INRJVYIA4Q3,"I had recently come off reading The Passage and was looking for an intelligent vampire fix. I loved the del Toro's movie Pan's Labyrinth--I thought it was dark, intelligent, and magical--so I had high hopes for The Strain. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed. I almost didn't finish reading it in fact, but finally mustered through.Maybe it's an unfair comparison to The Passage, which I thought was superbly developed (though yes, it's 800 pages long). To me, The Strain read like a screenplay. I did think Setrakian was very well developed, and the introduction of Sardu at the beginning is what initially hooked me into the book; however, I thought the origin story could have used more development. That's why I thought screenplay--Hogan and del Toro glossed over huge parts of the origin story that pre-dates Sardu. To me, those plot points are too big to just gloss over. Maybe their intent is to fill this in in the subsequent books; unfortunately, they didn't hook me enough to make me want to read the subsequent books. In addition while I don't mind gore, I thought they relied a bit too much on gore and supplied too little depth.In my opinion the high points were the Sardu origin story, the Setrakian character, and the gritty rat hunter Vasily Fet. I also liked the setup of the four survivors and the suspense developed when they went home. On the other hand, I cared surprisingly little about the main protagonist, Goodweather. And then there were the plot development weaknesses listed above.Like I said, my expectations may have been too high, but this book just didn't live up to its promise. I read enough glowing reviews to know that others felt differently. In my humble opinion, read The Passage. I thought it was a wonderfully developed, intelligent reboot of the vampire genre.",0,0

I ordered the cover, paid $10 in shipping and hoped for the best.  It arrived and we attempted to put in on our canopy frame.  NO WAY, NO HOW does this thing fit on our swing.  We tried and tried.

There are little pockets that look like you should put part of the frame in, but they don’t stay on the frame.  The main issue though, is the fact that it’s impossible to put the big screws through the holes of the canopy fabric when you attach the canopy to the swing.  It’s at least 4 inches too short to fit.  I contacted customer service about a return and they keep telling me I won’t get my refund if the cover is not in usable condition.

RZ38WBYSDSW1K,"This book got off to a very bad start.  The first paragraph, (the THIRD SENTENCE!), contains a glaring error.  Shifting gears on a motorcycle is done using the left foot, not the right foot.  If the authors are going to go into details on the fluid grace that is a proper motorcycle gear change, they should at least ask someone who has ridden a motorcycle to review what they have written.  This kind of error is inexcusable, in my opinion.  In all fairness, in general the technical details of this sort were much better than in many other books I have read.The book suffered a bit from bad dialog.  For example:  ""Accident, my cute behind,"" said Molly.  Who talks like that about a murdered friend?  Accident, my a$$ would be a bit more believable.Overall, I thought the book was pretty good, up until the trial section.  That part of the book was so implausible that it required a concerted effort not to burst out laughing at the absurdity.  Some examples:-One of Jack's high school classmates just happened to be a medical examiner who was able to examine his brother's body.  She finished college, finished medical school, did her internship, worked in a clinic, and then became a county medical examiner, skilled at doing autopsies, all by the ripe old age of 29.  Nice career so far.-The ability to keep the police and FBI from tracking down the source of a live broadcast for two days is ludicrous.-The idea that the three or four accomplices in the kidnapping could get off scot-free is ridiculous.  The accomplices were Jack's best friends, and the police and FBI couldn't figure who they were?  The premise was that the kidnapping victims were so upset about the whole affair they wouldn't be able to identify them.  Ridiculous.-On a similar note, one of the kidnapping victims says in the live broadcast that they were transported in a milk delivery truck.  How many milk delivery trucks could there be in the area?  And one of Jack's best friends is now working as a milk delivery driver.  Nope, the FBI couldn't crack that mystery.-The ending was like that of a cheesy, feel-good, made-for-TV movie, as other reviewers have said.This is far from the worst book I ever read, which is Babylon Rising.  (Beach House is like a literary masterpiece compared to that piece of printed puke.)The book might be worth a read, but is not worth spending any money on it.  Borrow it, don't buy it.",0,0
R291BSHCTH6DL,"[NOTE: This review has been rewritten on February 17th, 2010.]Where do I begin?Well, a few years ago, I made a visit to the bookstore. While I was there, I came across a paperback edition of Christopher Paolini's critically-acclaimed Eragon, which is the first installment of The Inheritance Cycle. I always heard about the praise which was given to both the book and the author, and how he wrote this book starting at the age of fifteen, and so on. I gave it a try; I picked it up and immediately read the Prologue & the first two chapters. What I got from it was mild frustration. The chapters reminded me of the introduction to Star Wars: A New Hope. I guess I forgot to tell you that not only did I hear praise, but criticism as well. Many people have lambasted this book for copying Star Wars and Lord of the Rings, and I couldn't help but be reminded of that exact criticism. I quickly put Eragon back on the shelf, and I continued on in the bookstore. Cut to February of 2010, when I find myself interested in Eragon once again, but in a different way. I wanted to see how it really fared out. Is it really bad as some critics say? Is it really good? Is it just average? I didn't purchase it, however; I borrowed a hardcover edition from the library. And this, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, this became the beginning of a dismal journey. Oh, the torture!Now, like millions of people worldwide, I am an avid reader. I can read anything from fantasy epics, political thrillers, non-fiction, Shakespeare, etc. From Don Quixote to Empire Falls to even Percy Jackson & the Olympians, I have enjoyed reading almost every book that I have ever touched. All but Eragon, and a few others. Honestly, I don't think I have ever read a book as awful as Eragon. I didn't find myself fully immersed in the story. I didn't find myself caring for the characters. I didn't find the writing extraordinary or inspirational. I didn't even find the front cover very interesting to look at (but I don't judge a book by its cover, anyway). It's almost appalling to think that this was ever published.I did like one thing about Eragon, and that was the premise. The plot about a boy befriending a dragon sounds really touching (Cornelia Funke's Dragon Rider is an example of the premise done right). Unfortunately, this exact idea had to be the victim of a simplistic, formulaic plot. If you have read Tolkien's Lord of the Rings and have seen the original Star Wars trilogy, then you will notice major similarities. This is arguably the oldest formula in fantasy fiction: average villager goes on an epic journey, villager discovers he is a ""chosen one,"" villager battles against all odds in order to defeat the villain. We've seen this story before. Both Tolkien & George Lucas used the exact same formula for their own works, but unlike Paolini, both of them added in some fresh material and made these stories undoubtedly their own. Here, Paolini has made no changes whatsoever to the formula. And that's one of the bigger problems with Eragon's plot. There is no originality found in the entire story. Seriously, it's so overstuffed with clichés that if I were to count them all, I would give up halfway through due to exhaustion.The characters are clichéd as well. We have elves, dwarves, witches, the works. We haven't seen these races before, have we? Plus, every protagonist, antagonist, and supporting character is very 2-dimensional. The villains are always evil, while the heroes are always good. That's it. There is no development on their motives, their personalities, or their causes & effects on the actual story. There is absolutely nothing that makes them distinctive. Brom, Katrina, and Murtagh are bad enough, but it's the character of Eragon himself that tops them all with his strange appearance and personality. First of all, the fifteen-year old boy talks and acts like a grown adult sometimes. One minute, his dialogue in simple, and the next minute, it's almost Shakespearean. He is of average intelligence, and yet he has the ability to talk like a scholar from time to time? Where did this sort of logic come from? Secondly, he somehow learns about sword-fighting in a matter of weeks, and is able to fight in battle a few months later. I know this sort of thing is acceptable in fantasy fiction, but this is just pushing too far. I mean, he's only a kid, and yet he is educated so quickly about the rules of combat. That.....is beyond my understanding. Thirdly, since he discovers he has become a dragon rider, his personality soon changes. Or rather, it changes from strange to even stranger. As I was reading, I couldn't help but see that Eragon and others are starting to see him as a messiah. This leads to the formation of arrogance. But even that soon becomes illogical, since his change of emotion is all over the place. Luckily, I saved myself from the confusion by concluding that Eragon is not a likable character. I couldn't really care about him, and that leads to my fourth problem with this character. Throughout the book, Eragon is always the main focus. It's either about him and his dragon Saphira, his encounter with people of various races, and his commitment (or lack thereof) to defeat the antagonists. It's almost always about him, and it sometimes gets annoying. Why does it always have to feel like he's the center of attention? If there were two or three more characters (of the same age) that journeyed along with Eragon, then it would have been far more interesting, because it wouldn't always be about this one boy. We would have some real friendship and cooperation; we would have teamwork instead of solo accomplishments. It would have made some intriguing material. And finally, the fifth problem I have with Eragon is that he doesn't have any real chemistry with the other characters. It seems that his relationships with Saphira, Brom, Roran, and Arya feel very forced; the conversations aren't very compelling (Brom and Eragon's discussions are especially painfully dull). In addition, Eragon always argues with his friends, but then he is united with their own views later on. This really brings a ton of confusion to their interactions with one another. And why in the world is Eragon always with ADULTS and not kids his own age? Wouldn't that affect his social capabilities when he reaches his own adulthood? *sigh*The plot and characters are bad, but the writing itself is another matter. People are always saying that Paolini is a brilliant writer, and that he has created a work of art. Paolini himself has compared his work to Lord of the Rings and Beowulf. Have we really lost our intelligence? This book would be torn apart if it were up against Lord of the Rings. And yes, I have read both Beowulf and Lord of the Rings; these two are rightfully named as literary classics. Eragon is not, and if it is, then humanity is lost forever. Moreover, Paolini's writing style really puzzles me. There are too many uses of the word ""was."" There are misplaced verbs, adverbs, and adjectives everywhere, as well as an excessive amount of them in general. The ""show, don't tell"" rule is broken many times. And who can forget those unnecessary similes? Well, neither can I. The writing is indeed excruciating.And now, we come to a very important element of the novel: the demographic. Is this supposed to be aimed at kids or teens? Is this suitable to grownups? Is it for people of all ages? I don't know. I can't really tell. Even though this is originally for younger audiences, I think it's a bit debatable. The violence suggests that it's for adults, but the simplistic storyline might indicate that it's for kids. It's almost to the point that it is a mystery that needs to be solved. In the end, I'd say both kids and adults deserve better.I could go on forever with what's wrong with this novel, but I can't. Why? Because I don't think I can take the pain of doing so! Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, this is it! This is the abomination that I, and many others, have sadly experienced! Eragon is simply the worst book that I have ever read in my entire life. Almost everything about it is a failure. Clichéd plot, dull characters, idiotic hero, laughable dialogue, slow pacing, deplorable writing, and a questionable tone dominate over 500 pages of boredom and pain. And I don't care if the author wrote this at a young age. He should have delayed the publication of his work in order to make some major improvements. Don't get me wrong, Paolini does have some potential. Unfortunately, it doesn't show here. Aside from all the flaws, Eragon does have one thing going (apart from the premise mentioned above). As an aspiring writer, this book has given me some splendid advice on how NOT to write a novel. You got to give Paolini some credit for making us see what's wrong and what's right. Overall, Eragon is an agonizing read from the Prologue to the glossary. It's an embarrassment in the fantasy genre, and it's pure trash. I can't wait to return it to the library.Grade: FP.S.This book is so terrible, that it makes me wonder if Eldest is even worse.....",0,0

RY7GQ5BLIUYM2,"There are four parts to this book, paraphrased and interpreted by me.1. ""the mindset of evil people""2. ""If you are poor and/or ill prepared go to a FEMA camp, they're great""3. ""If you are not in a FEMA camp, think about scavenging""4. ""Basic things that homesteaders do and will do if SHTF""My response: (this is my opinion)1. Instead of reading this book, read Dave Grossman and Rory Miller to get a glimpse into the psychology of war, of evil people. Get a free copy of Sun Tzu's art of war.2. You should prep. You should avoid FEMA camps if at all possible, if only for the fact that you not being there opens up a spot for someone else. People who would be reading this book are likely interested in prepping. There are tons of ways to prep on the cheap - in fact there are numerous blogs devoted to the subject. Pooling resources and making a tribe of like minded individuals, despite being poor is a good solution. The solution is not to encourage folks who have not prepared, but for some reason were reading a book about SHTF, to voluntarily go to a FEMA camp. Please do some research on what conditions were like in FEMA camps. In every situation it was not a good. This portion of the book, in my opinion, made me go from mildly appreciating the sophomoric analysis of evil people into severely doubting this man's moral compass. This part ruined the book and earned a single star.3. Scavenging. There are better books/blogs/articles out there of how to scavenge. Joe Nobody has a decent book on it. Honestly it was hard to focus on this section because I was still reading it from the standpoint of his 'go get raped in the FEMA camp, you prepper-book-reading non-prepper idiot' mindset. It was difficult to transition to that. And no, going to the FEMA camp with a positive mindset and will to thrive in bad situations isnt the ideal solution. Yes, having the right mindset will help you. No, going to a FEMA camp is not to be advocated as a long term survival plan.My suggestion to the author is to greatly modify his approach to the 'FEMA camp' portion of his ebook. Put it at the end (or make it a different ebook altogether, sheesh), and be super clear of your intentions. If you feel like the criticism you have undoubtedly been receiving is unfair, then you have not communicated something properly. If you wish to communicate something else than what your feedback is saying, go and change your ebook. Sell it for a dollar and talk through the issues in a better way.",0,0

R2GM2RHT5PZP50,"My original review of this book was this:....a sad day in anthropology when such outlandish claims are taken for some kind of highly evolved truth.I have nothing against writing about mystical, magical experiences so long as the author makes plain that they are offered in a spirit of ""take it or leave it.""  But to lay them out as objective, empirical, SCIENTIFIC fieldwork without providing some kind of corroboration is scientifically dishonest.Maybe the miracles in Castaneda's books really happened.  But he should not be in the position of expecting us to believe them without proof.It doesn't surprise me that he hid from the public.  He'd have been asked embarrassing questions like:  why all the inconsistencies throughout your books, some of them really rather flagrant?  Are your writings scholarship or fiction?  Why have you not informed the reader of the genre in which you believe you work?  Why did you play such a dumb Watson to don Juan's Sherlock Holmes of the spirit?  Where is your field documentation?When seers in good faith offer descriptions of their unusual journeyings, we all benefit.  But when authors so conceal themselves that we aren't even sure when they were born, then proceed to pass off supposedly nonordinary happenings as scientifically objective, we're obliged to suspect salesmanship.A more recent addition:A friend just told me that one of Castaneda's lovers has outed him in print as the perpetrator of a fraud.I haven't read what she wrote, but what angers me about books like Castaneda's is that their secrecy and shoddy scholarship make all ""alternative"" accounts of reality suspect.  Another outstanding example is Gurdjief, who after bragging at length about his ability to flummox people turns around and asks for belief in the mystical brotherhood he supposedly encountered in the mountains.  Selling cars that stop working in a week would be more honest--and less damaging to those voices from the margins trying to tell us about ""the farther reaches of human nature"" and nature itself as a mysterious spiritual realm we have scarcely begun to explore.If, as an author, you've been abducted by aliens or shown the glowing outlines of God's divine plan for the universe, then at least have the goodness to keep it all tentative:  ""Something happened to me that I cannot explain in the usual language.  I'm not asking for belief, but only for a little space to discuss my account of what it was--which you don't have to believe...."" would do just fine for most of us.  Better yet, tell us exactly what you did--which means:  tell us honestly without convenient gaps--so we can experiment with it ourselves and see if the same doors open for us.  Anything else, and you're just adding to the list of unscrupulous opportunists fattening your bank account on stolen bits and pieces of genuine revelation.",0,0

At first I thought perhaps there was an issue related to the rim (e.g. the hole for the tube was not finished, etc.) but it checked out fine, and the tube I installed after both of the slime tubes failed has had no similar issues.

R2QXFEC95YHKW8,"My most vivid memory from the 2005 Academy Awards has to be the reaction Jack Nicholson gave the entire live crowd upon reading the winner for Best Picture. Everyone there was clearly expecting ""Brokeback Mountain"" or ""Walk The Line"" to carry off that award. But, they didn't, and Nicholson's shocked expression spoke sheer volumes to that effect. I don't even think he was expecting to find ""Crash"" written anywhere inside that envelope.The fact is, nobody listening was expecting to hear him announce it either.Why? Because, quite simply, ""Crash"" did not deserve to win Best Picture.Don't get me wrong. This film was certainly very well acted and well-intentioned. But, haven't we all seen this exact same story done countless times before? I can think of at least five other race-related films that were far more deserving of the gushing accolades Paul Haggis received for this release. His depiction of modern-day Los Angeles is so unrealistically off the mark and behind the times. This is not to say that racism no longer exists within that city or across this nation, because it obviously does. But, come on, let's get real! Do asian americans or citizens of middle eastern descent honestly speak or represent themselves as stereotypically as they do within the context of this motion picture? Sorry, but none of them in my own personal experience ever have. The minorities depicted here were far better suited to a screenplay set in and around the rabidly less-tolerable 1960s. My spouse of fifteen years, who happens to be black, picked up on this observation right away, as did many of our mutual friends who have lived their entire lives within the greater Los Angeles area.The first rate acting from the highly decorated and talented cast is all that unfortunately moves me to grant ""Crash"" two meager stars. If you pay anything less than the same $6.99 we wasted for a copy at Best Buy last night, it would still be far more money than this over-rated and horrendously propagandic ""Oscar winner"" deserves.",0,0

RJVQYZ5DQY586,"Here is an honest review from someone who is educated in Islamic history. First of all I would like to make it clear that this book is filled with biases when it claims there is none. There are references used coming from non authentic Shiah texts which obviously are heavily favoured towards Imam Ali. The author did a good job in making it interesting and engaging from the start however as you read along the book you will realise the constant praising of Imam Ali.For example, in Chapter 5 it mentions how Yazid ordered to cut Hussein's head off, this is not true. This is a view that has been shunned by the mainstream sunni scholars of Al Azhar Institute and others. I was hoping to read a book with 0 biases but this has too many references towards Shiah views and beliefs and most of it is not authentic. The author should have made it clear that this is a grey area in Islamic history and that only Shiahs have this point of view neither is it authentic.If you are looking for an Islamic History book at an Academic level with 0 biases, then unfortunately this book is not for you. However if you are well versed in Islamic history like I am, and are able to spot out the inaccuracies in this book then you could buy it, there is still some engaging valuable information, just know you are going to be putting extra effort into tracing references and sources for every text you read to confirm its authenticity, as you will soon realise alot of it is non-authentic.",0,0

R3VAX78AE3WATQ,"The only reason I didn't cancel my purchase was because only verified purchasers can write reviews. And I feel strongly about this book. The positives:* The writing style is very good (it flows, character development is good)* There weren't any annoying typos, which can yank you right out of the story when there are enough of themThe negatives:* There was practically no plot. Boy meets girl, girl's fiance dies under slightly suspicious circumstances, and then there was no further tension until more than halfway through the book. Then there's a bit more plot (not much). I kept hoping there would be SOMETHING. Something involving the vintage t-shirts, maybe? The sister Bell? Something beyond the yadda yadda about the evolving love interest. Because several hundred pages of two people reconnecting after five years and falling in love, knit together by sex scenes, no matter how hot, does not a book make. Plus, the  journal's 'here's how we're going to let the reader in on what's really going on' device towards the end was cheesy-easy.* This story chopped off in the middle, making it crystal clear that you have to pay for the sequel to find out what happens to the characters.

I bought the Lactic Acid serum for $95.00 online from this spa as I heard great reviews by Lisa Eldridge, famous make up artist and youtube guru who was probably paid by this spa to review their product but unknowingly I was a sucker for love of all things skin care. I really trusted this would be a great product, however when I received it, the tube was literally a 10 pump max tube and the actual product smelled straight like perfume. I don't think anything that should be good for your skin should have so much fragrance in it. However, I did give it a try, I used small amounts of it as my skin is super thick and can handle most anything. oh no not this product, I broke out in huge cystic acne in odd places such as the left side of my face right by my eye. It literally is taking me 2 months to get rid of the side effects. I was VERY disappointed in a small product with big promise at an outrageous retail price point.

RUYHSUSKZA9R0,"St. Elmo's Fire is a coming-of-age movie that will have a certain nostalgic appeal to anyone who was a teenager or a 20-something in the mid-1980s. It will be of limited interest to anyone else, unless you are excessively interested in the pop culture of that era.The main characters of St. Elmo's Fire are seven recent college graduates who are beginning their professional lives. As other reviewers have noted, these people aren't credible as an ensemble of friends---nor are they particularly believable on their own merits. Somewhere in this mess is a story about the transition from adolescence to adulthood; but the inconsistent characters and disjointed plotlines distract the viewer from the larger themes.To cite just one example: Emilio Estevez's character, Kirby, develops a severe infatuation with an older woman. He acts out his obsession in ways that would disturb anyone, even threatening the woman's roommate at one point. But the woman who is the object of his desires seems to regard these antics as vaguely cute. People were not quite as sensitive about stalking and sexual harassment in the 1980s as they are today; but this behavior would have been over the top even then. No woman would have tolerated this, much less found it endearing.Demi Moore's character, Jules, is a compulsive liar who becomes addicted to cocaine. No adequate explanation is ever given for her behavior. Throughout the movie, she moves from one unexplained crisis to the next. Nor does the partial resolution of her conflicts at the end of the movie make any sense.I watched this DVD with high expectations. I was a teenager in 1985; and I remember that this movie was heavily hyped at the time. But after spending 108 minutes on St. Elmo's Fire, I could not help thinking that I might have gone another 22 years without this experience---- and been no worse off.",0,0
R23POLWD3XGUFL,"Don't believe the hype! ""Sideways"" is an unbearable, unwatchable and tedious film about despicable, pretentious and uninteresting people. Flawed characters are one thing, but there is nothing redeemable about any of these lead players. Quite frankly, I wouldn't want to spend two minutes with them at a wine tasting party, much less watch a 4 hr movie about them (well...it felt like four hours.)Thomas Hayden Church as a hot movie star that both men and women drool over?

R1651XV2JLX1Y5,"I would not have completed _Eragon_ if I had not wanted to write a review. (I don't think it's fair to write a review of a book one has not finished.) The finishing, though, required considerable force of will. I did not enjoy this book.Eragon has many faults, but I'll stick with four: first, Mr. Paolini cannot decide what kind of book he wants to write - a children's book or an adult fantasy, a story in mythic language (Tolkien style) or in the more modern fantasy traditions. His indecision produces absurd combinations of language and event. For instance, the plot of Eragon is so transparent and predictable as to be surprising only to a small child. One tends to assume, therefore, that it is a children's book. Yet the author casually tosses in a bit of dialogue in which a female elf describes how, after torture, she was given to the garrison for rape. She solved her problem by magically making her rapists impotent. The language is terse, but the meaning unmistakable. This seems a bit adult for a children's book. In addition, the narration see-saws inconsistently between mythic language and modern speech. Paolini's attempts to describe events such as the one above in grand mythic language make the writing feel almost farcical. There's another bit where he tries to grandly describe how the villain kicked the good guy ""in the fork of the legs"" and un-chivalrously won a fight. If Paolini was sticking to gritty, modern fantasy-style narration, or if he was intending to write a parody, this sort of thing might work. However, in his high Tolkien-esque monologues, it sounds absurd. Sadly, this sort of unintentional farce is the _only_ humor in the book.Problem number two: Mr. Paolini would benefit greatly from Steven's King's short, but brilliant, manual _On Writing_. I'm thinking particularly of the sentence, ""Adverbs are not your friends."" I grew exceedingly weary of needless adverbs tacked onto the end of every over conversation tag, (said the reviewer irritably.)Problem number three: the protagonist is stupid. He is so stupid, I hated him by the end of the first chapter, and he doesn't get any brighter. The dragon is actually walking around his room before he realizes that *bing!* the ""rock"" was an egg! Of course, if Eragon was _supposed_ to be a half-wit or a young child, this might work. Readers don't mind figuring out events in advance of an admittedly young or stupid protagonist. However, this is not the case. In fact, everyone is continually telling Eragon how he is exceptionally bright, and he is forever discovering new and wonderful abilities that he performs better than anyone else.Finally, ""show, don't tell"" is most emphatically not a phrase in this author's vocabulary. I grew bored to tears of his endless explanations - pages and pages of dialogue in which various characters laboriously map out for Eragon the hows and wherefores of his world.One might ask: if I found the book so distasteful, why give it two stars instead of one? The reason is that I do think the author has some talent, though perhaps not best displayed in a novel. In fact, this book read very like the script for a King's Quest-style role playing game. In that media, I think the story might actually be quite charming, and many of the more annoying elements would not survive the transition. But for a novel...? No.It is, of course, possible that the writer will clean up his style in a blindingly superior manner before he writes the next book (nothing is resolved in this one), but I wouldn't count on it. Nothing short of large amounts of money could induce me to read the sequel.",0,0

R31D2VVMJAZ8KM,"Well, I have to say, I feel bad about this review. I had quit ordering books through the Amazon Vine program, I just hated giving bad reviews. I know that is the whole idea, but I just find if difficult to give bad reviews.So with that said, I saw the description of this book and decided to give it a go. I love Dragons, love urban fantasy and have a few paranormal romance authors I like. Seemed right up my alley.I just could not connect with this book at all. It read so surface, no connection with the characters,the plot, or the dragon history. I had to make myself keep reading, I really did not care at all about what happened. There was no depth to the story, no depth to the romance, a lot of it quite silly. This is not something I would recommend.",0,0
R2IA1NR52CO0J5,"This book was awful! I wanted to cry for the terrible way Christina was treated. I also wanted to shake some sense into her sometimes, I admit. Most of all I wanted to yell at and punch and whip Phillip himself. I don't think I've ever read a worse ""hero."" He wanted her for selfish reasons, the way he viewed things was so stupid it showed he had no common sense, this guy was more like one of those creepy bad guys in romance books, not a hero. I would have smacked him and whipped him myself, instead of yelling how much she hated him, as if that helped her. This book should not have been published. There's not a shred of love in here. No wonder Phillip's mother left her father! How could he possibly think their marriage was fine when she left him to live back in England? His brain was nowhere to be found, just like his decency. And if he shouted at her one more time about respect, I was ready to throw the book across the room. He showed her not an ounce of respect. I read all the reviews already, and decided to just give it a try, while expecting it to be not so good. It wasn't just not so good. It was the absolute worst thing she has ever written. This reminded me of those Rosemary Rogers books or Bertrice Small. Who could ever fall in love with those sheiks? They're so horrible! I don't know why anybody writes romance books about them. There's nothing that could possibly attract a woman to them. And if it's physical attraction, they're pretty dumb then.",0,0
R16RWQNVKYXZCI,"I definitely agree with the last reviewer - this movie was horrendous. The first time I watched it I barely got through the first 30 minutes. It felt like someone's thesis on race relations in the United States. In an attempt to create the most unlikely of situations to prove that race is not as black and white as it may seem, the writer tried to create scenes that were too artificial and too distilled to be of substance. The ensemble cast was a talented bunch, but poorly used. The performances in general may be the only redeeming thing about a movie that seems like it was written by a college freshman trying to impress his film professor.",0,0

RBO2QRC5TNJOD,"Eragon by Christopher Paolini was, in my opinion, an artistic failure. To begin with, the plot is as follows, briefed, of course: A boy on the verge of growing into a man discovers something thing will forever change his life: a dragon. (Slight Spoilers) However, when he loses his uncle, our hero vowes to take up revenge. Assisting him is a shady storyteller who knows more than he reveals.Such a plot has been overdone, to put it nicely. Without any orignality, this book simply fails. The prose is not good (lots of telling, incorrect word usage, sentence blunders, uneeded descriptions, overdosed adverbs, and lack of reality). If this were Tolkien, I would have rethought even touching Fantasy ever again.It seems to me that those who read this book and enjoy it are teenagers who haven't tasted Fantasy, or if they have, it's been through video games and movies such as LOTR the movies and/or Final Fantasy. If you are included in that group, then by all means, you might just love this book and admire Mr. Paolini for doing what he did: creating an ""epic"".However, I don't find anything ""epic"". The world is dull and a complete rip from Tolkien, more so than any other Tolkenesque world I've run across. The storyline is straight from Star Wars, no denying it. The plot is linear, making me feel like the ripped-off world is really alive. While Eragon and Brom are off, I feel as if the entire world is just standing still, waiting to be graced by the presence of our hero(s).I'm troubled by the fact a literature teacher found this as excellent. Shakespeare and Homer lost their places in the classroom, perhaps?If you are a fan of fantasy and have been reading for many years, or even if you've just started and enjoy class literature, may I direct you to George Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire, R. S. Bakker's The Prince of Nothing, Steven Erikson's Malazan, the Fallen, Madaline Howard's The Hidden Stars, or (for those who like to be bold) Mervyn Peake's Gormenghast? Those series have brought me great pleasure. I'm sorry, Mr. Paolini, but I'll take either Tyrion, Steerpike, Frodo, Whiskeyjack, or Prince Raun over Eragon, book and character.",0,0

RK5VC245FEWHZ,"The legend of Phantasm continues with the fourth and most recent  installment: Phantasm OlbIVion.  Though the first Phantasm did not seem to  need sequels (see my review), the director/writer makes enough  ""clarifications"" to the story of the Tall Man to allow for the 3  sequels.As with all horror sequels that suffer from the ""sequel  syndrome"", it is a must for things to get a little more out-of-hand,  more unreal, and more supernatural.  The villain, in this case the Tall  Man, becomes virtually indestructible.  Whereas there was one sphere in the  first, he we have as many as 30.  While there were a limited number of  deaths in the first, here we have whole towns that have been killed.The  story is very simple.  Something has happened to Mike Pearson and he is  afraid he will turn into another Tall Man.  So, he races to the place where  he can confront the Tall Man.  Of course, the Tall Man also wants this  confrontation, so he guides Mike to where he has his followers and his  dimensional doors.Reggie, concerned about Mike, follows closely behind.  At the beginning of the movie, he is trapped by the Tall Man, who frees him  for no apparent reason.  And no, the reason does not become apparent later  in the movie.  Though dead since before the first movie, Mike's brother  Jody also appears in this movie.  Mike is having trouble figuring out whose  side Jody's incarnation is on.  So did I.This director/writer has a  penchant for unpopular endings.  The ending of Phantasm I was a let down to  the point that it was ""clarified"" to allow for sequels.  (The  beginning of this movie actually attempts to clarify what has happened in I  to III in a manner that seems to make it all fit together.)  Notwithstanding, the director/writer again chooses an unpopular  ending.Perhaps hoping for another sequel, the story ends when Mike is  left dying (and we believe he will die), and the Tall Man has won.  Reggie  chases after the Tall Man, but we don't see him again.  Instead, we see a  scene of Reggie and Mike when they were younger in Reggie's ice-cream truck  driving along in their hometown.  In the background, we hear the voice of a  dying Mike.  Somehow, I also hear sequel.  This is also a common symptom of  the ""sequel syndrome"" (ie, having to leave the door just a little  open).The most eerie aspect of Phantasm IV is that it stars all of the  original actors.  They all look (much) older and should, since this movie  was filmed 19 years after the original.  This allows the director to insert  scenes of the original, even outtakes, to help complete his story and to  help explain what is happening.  This really adds a sense of realism  otherwise difficult to accomplish.Overall, it is a good movie.  However,  it does not have the emotional depth of the original.  Furthermore, the  triumph of evil over good, the apparent death of Mike, and the apparent  second death of the Jody ""incarnation"",  added to the  disappointment I felt as the movie concluded.",0,0

RBNZ678TKMHZY,"I saw this movie for three reasons. 1, it's a ""Comedy/drama,"" and being an aspiring actor, I wanted to learn something. 2, it looked interesting, 3, my friend badly wanted to see it, so we went to the theatre. From beginning to end I wanted to leave, but kept thinking ""well, I'm sure some good will come out of this movie"" (none did). Yes-the acting and directing was supurb and phenominal, but the content was filthy! This screams American trash, garbage, and filth all rolled into one! Before I go on I'd like to say happy for those who liked this film and they are entitled to their opinions. And if you have seen this, or going to see this because your favorite actor, director or producer was apart of it, hey, the more power to you. Located in the rich suberbs, Kevin spacey stars as Lester, the husband and father of a disfunctional family, whom from the beginning is masturbating in the shower because his wife is to controoling to be with him. Annette Benning's character is a shallow, phony, snob who ends up cheating on her husband with somebody she works with. Their teenage rebellious daughter sleeps with the neighbor boy who was following them around with a video-camera from the beginning, and she hangs around a filthy-mouthed friend whom the dad tries to sleep with. Then again it was my fault: I didn't know much about the movie, and it was rated ""R"" so I should have known better.

R3HWW0UGENKK2K,"I was attracted to the book because it aims to cover the whole time period (1776 - present). I am not a historian myself and did not wish to perform independent research on the subject. The book seemed like a major piece of scholarly work. The author went to great lengths to make the reader think that this is a balanced view of history, until we reach the 20th century; it is then that his credibility starts waning, since I have read many different accounts of the major events of the 20th century. e.g. Margaret Macmillan's book about the Paris Peace conference of 1919, ""Six months that changed the World"".He writes a glowing profile of David Ben-Gurion while his account of Mustafa Kamal of Turkey portrays him as a conniving conspirator at best. And that is how most of the 20th century gets covered. US presidents might have made some mistakes but they meant well, while Arab leaders could never be trusted. The fact is that all these figures were trying to manage their volatile environments, while empires were crumbling, any way they could. They were not much better or worse than one another. The things they did had more to do with their political systems (or lack thereof) than their moral superiority. The theme of an enlightened America bringing civilization to the Middle East stands in stark contrast to, for example, America showing up in Japanese waters in the 1850s forcing them to open up for trade at gunpoint (treaty of Kanagawa, one of the so-called Unequal Treaties). That convinced the Japanese that they need a strong military, thereby embarking on their own militaristic ambitions. We all know how that ended. The point is that history is more complicated and inter-connected than to make the simple claim that America became federal and got a navy because of the Barbary wars. Isaac Asimov said: the trouble with logic is that you can prove anything in the world, so long as you make the appropriate assumptions. This is a great example of molding facts to suit one's conclusion.Comparing George Washington to Moses, King George to the Pharaoh, Atlantic ocean to the Red Sea, America to the promised land, 13 states to the ten tribes, a pattern starts emerging where the author goes to great lengths trying to convince the reader that support for the state of Israel is America's moral, civic and faith-based obligation; that many presidents were instructed by their childhood priests (e.g. Clinton) to defend Israel or burn in hell. He is also grief-stricken that an American was imprisoned for spying for Israel (he mentions it a few times in the book). And then I learn that the author is not just an American historian but also a major in the Israeli Defense Forces. I avoid books by a biased party for the same reason that biased parties are avoided as judges and juries: clouded judgment even if they mean well. The author could have mentioned that fact in the Introduction, but apparently, he did not think it was relevant or material information.Describing the 2003 Iraqi invasion, the author declares: ""While Iraq's buffoonish Information Minister, Mohammed Saeed Alsahaf, known to the press as Baghdad Bob, ..."". I have never come across such characterization (buffoonish) by a historian. I am disappointed; many of the things in the book may be true, and yet the half-truths and one-sided accounts make me question not just what he mentions in the book but what he might have omitted. He is a good storyteller though; I'll give him that. May be he should apply his talent to the history of another region of the world, so there's no conflict of interest.It would be redundant to mention instances that have already been mentioned by other reviewers, like the USS Liberty incident, which, evidence suggests, was an attempt to blame the attack on Egypt and get the U.S. directly involved in the 1967 conflict. After reading a few reviews in each star category, one can make up one's own mind about the pros and cons. The reviews on Amazon represent what is great about America: democracy and open debate, pre-cursors to understanding, which is a pre-cursor to the end of hatred. Again, the world is not so simple and yet Humanity has no choice but to try to achieve that goal. All children of the world are innocent and they deserve our efforts towards that end.",0,0

R26KR1IOKINP3,Ultraviolet takes place in a dystopian future where the world has been divided between people infected with a disease that makes them vampires and the humans. The vampires created a resistance with Ultraviolet (Milla Jovovich) being one of the main insurgents. She ends up standing up to both sides to try to rescue a child.The first thing about the movie is that seeing Jovovich in a futuristic action movie is that the viewer immediately thinks of the Resident Evil franchise she starred in. It is a very similar role and has a similar look as well with lots of computer graphics. Also like that series there’s just a bit on the story and then the rest of the movie is one big chase and gun battle. Basically Ultraviolet couldn’t escape the shadow of Jovovich’s other movies and suffered as a result.C,0,0

In only 1 project (the very simplest) the code compiles correctly. In all other projects the code in the book does not compile.  In most instances the code in the book does not match the code downloaded from the authors website, and does not match the code in the video examples.  Sometimes even the code in the text does not match the code in the screen shots provided in the book.-  But it does not really matter as none of it compiles.In summary this book is full of errors and inconsistencies and is a very frustrating book to try and follow.There does not seem to have been any update at all - in fact in one of the projects I googled the solution and found it on a notice board with a response from the author saying the person posting it  was a genius for finding the solution - but still the author did not post an update or if he did his code still did not compile!!I have a library of two or three hundred books on application development and understand the difficulties in keeping up with fast moving technology advances.

RQYWX4ENQTMX2,"Those of you who are curious about Turistas won't miss anything earth shattering if you pass it by. As other reviewers have correctly pointed out, this movie is another lame attempt at extreme horror in the recent  subgenre of torture films, a la SAW, HOSTEL, etc. However, Turistas is really bad, and is simply a movie where the violence and gore exist for the sake of the movie. Without these elements, you have no movie. Unlike decent horror films that actually stand on their own without gratuitous blood and guts (but include them for extra effect), Turistas is boring and filled with more holes than swiss cheese.Every scene of blood and gore is unnecessary; when a girl falls off a cliff, do we need to see her splat on the ground to know she died in the fall? When a guy gets his head split open, do we need to constantly see his gaping head wound? And when some dude staples it shut with a staple gun, do we need to see this done in loving detail? To demonstrate how evil the Brazilian surgeon is, did he really have to plunge a skewer through the eye of his henchman and stir it around until he died? (All done at an outdoor cafe, and no one bats an eye)Perhaps most gratuitous and outrageous is the surgery scene where the evil doctor cuts open and extracts the internal organs from a female victim while she is still alive, then plops them on her chest. While the special effects are very good and realistic, did we REALLY have to see all of this in exacting detail to get the idea that this poor girl is having her organs removed without her consent, and is then thrown away like a sack of garbage?My favorite useless and idiotic scenes are when the stranded tourists agree to follow an english speaking Brazilian through miles of jungle only to reach a picturesque waterfall and pool...and go swimming. These are the same people who have had their tour bus go over a cliff, have recently been drugged and robbed of all their possessions, and are desperate, supposedly, to find the police and a way to get back to civilization. Yep, if I were them, in their situation, I would stray from the main roads, hike deep into unchartered jungle with a guy I don't even know, and go swimming. Brilliant.Second in my favorite idiotic plot sequences is the chase at the end through the underwater caves. Now put yourself into the shoes of the bad guys: you're kidnapping Western tourists and illegally removing their organs, killing them at the same time. Four of them escape from your clutches and run into the jungle. Okay, I might chase them a while, but once they start swimming around in underwater caves, what are the chances you're going to be able to recapture them? If they escape, do you really think they'll be able to find your secret liar again if they alert the authorities? Why not let them go and find new victims? Isn't following them into the underwater caves a bit foolhardy? Is it worth the effort?As a brilliant villian, I know how you would answer these questions. Seeing how almost everyone in this movie is pretty stupid, you can guess what happens when the bad guys enter the caves.As you can probably guess, Turistas is only a gore for the sake of gore movie. If all you want to do is watch a few scenes of excessive violence and grue, then please rent or buy Turistas. You can either fast forward the rest of the turgid movie or suffer through it, like I did. You've been warned.",0,0
RI506RVBV8QO2,"I can't believe this just won Best Picture. I had the urge to burn it after watching it last fall (since someone left it at my house). It is a maudlin, overbearing beast of a ""race picture."" I couldn't agree more with the review that recommends audiences to ""Do the Right Thing"" instead. ""Crash"" is overblown, didactic, convoluted, and humorless. Matt Dillon gives a decent performance. Terrance Howard is ok as a frustrated, seething executive. Thandie Newton is his petulant wife. Sorry to be so harsh, but how could that other recent LA movie (albeit from 2004) Michael Mann's ""Collateral"" go unawarded next to the burning wreckage that is ""Crash?"" I just don't get it.",0,0

R1UMNL2HPJLRO7,"""V for Vendetta"" is one of the most boring revolutionary epics I've ever watched.  With a screenplay and production by the Wachowski Brothers, I'd at least expect plenty of explosions and some neat special effects because, let's be honest, folks, the only reason that the first ""Matrix"" flick did very well was because of the whole slo-mo bullet biz.  After the initial shock, the sequels of that particular flick were nothing more than fluff.  However, it seems that the Wachowski boys were hoping that adapting a graphic novel (i.e. a really big comic book for adults too ashamed to admit they still read comics) with a Shakespeare-spouting, Fawkes mask-wearing, anti-hero/terrorist wannabe would make for a cool picture.  It almost did, but the fact is that Hugo Weaving's portrayal of ""V"" is so weighed down by theatrics that the viewer is more likened to take a nap than take up arms.  Natalie Portman delivers her standard wooden performance that won our hearts in the Star Wars prequels.  Why didn't they just go with an actual British woman to play her role?  Portman's only great performance was in ""The Professional"" with Jean Reno, and that was quite a few years ago.The story centers around a supposed terrorist who goes by the name ""V.""  He's mad at the government for making him into a hideous monster and has decided to overthrow said government by blowing up numerous British monuments and historically important buildings.  The only catch is that this ""terrorist"" politely allows all of the citizens inside the buildings to escape before he does his damage.  Doesn't quite sound like a terrorist to me.  Sounds more like a pest.The government head, gamely played by John Hurt, is supposedly meant to represent the current U.S. government.  However, the only thing that ran through my mind when we see Hurt's character screaming and ranting at his top officers was the same screaming and ranting done by Hilary Clinton, John Kerry, and perennial loser, Al Gore.  Hurt screams threats at everyone hoping to force them into submission.  He wants things his way and doesn't care what anyone else thinks.  He's a big baby, a dictator, just like many of today's liberal leaders attempt to be under the guise of ""tolerance.""  I hate to get political with this review, but a movie such as this begs to moved into that arena.The special effects are done fairly well, and the Wachowskis even pull the old bullet-time effect out of their dwindling bag of tricks except this time they use V's knives instead of bullets.I'll agree with other reviewers that this film does make you think.  A totalitarian government is an evil thing, but some sort of order is needed.  Without it, you have anarchy, and anarchy has never worked.  Why?  Because someone ultimately wants to be the leader.  To be a revolutionary with a clear idea of how things should be and the best way to engage those ideals is one thing, but to simply be a rebel without a reason is absurd.  This is a film about revenge, not revolution.If you loved the ""Matrix"" trilogy, you'll probably be disappointed by this flick.  The action is spread throughout a bogged down monologue by V and the end result attempts to be artistic, but falters in the end.Recommended as a rental only.",0,0
R12Z1SRHHHBC42,"I bought this book because the rating were good, but after reading about half the book, I think the readers were only interested in the sex, which was very repetitive.  The story was very slight, between long bouts of sex where Trey keeps calling Taryn Baby (as if she didn't even have a name) and forcing her to admit to feeling she didn't want to admit.  Not much here to hold my interest. I am also reading Kinked by Thea Harrison, which is a terrific book and a much better choice for someone looking for a romantic fantasy.",0,0

R2G4JZFOLJRVBM,"I guess it's good value: 6 audio CDs of high standard, beautifully read.  But I couldn't get into the rambling stories, they just weren't interesting. Even the first one, about a divorced guy who meets an Eastern European waitress and has a relationship with her, seemed unemotional. I got halfway through CD 2 when I took it out of the player in my car. The story was going on about people making comments about the EU and foreigners, none of it particularly interesting. The writer uses the F word freely, but that doesn't make for good stories.Anyway, another CD set for the charity shop. They always seem happy to see me with my offerings. One last thing-- as other reviewers have pointed out: there's no list of the stories, no form of indexing of the CDs which makes it difficult to go straight to the most boring one.

R1JWH1G8JXCFFI,"I wanted to give this two stars because the art is actually really, really good, but I can't in good concious give it more than one star. It contains nothing that made the first three books entertaining, which was the story and the characters. This isn't necessarily a problem since it's not a continuation of story; it's more of a companion piece to the books. The problem is that it somehow manages to distill all the last two books failings (extravagant, bloated details, gratuitous perversion, flowery, overwrought prose) into a faux encyclopedia.This book simply just isn't worth reading. It really is a shame that the great art in it was wasted on this dreck, but even it can't salvage this terrible book. If you are thinking about getting this to tide you over while waiting for The Winds of Winter, don't; I'd suggest moving on to another fantasy series or watch the HBO show while you wait.",0,0

R3D7HZRF97FDM2,"As many others have said, this book is ""Star Wars"" set in a Tolkien world with a dash of Anne McCaffrey thrown in for good measure.  I don't fault the author.  I think it is remarkable that a 16 year old had the self-discipline to write a 500 page novel.  However, I can't understand why a publisher would have  printed it.If the book were simply derivative, I could have, perhaps, forgiven the publisher.  But the book is poorly written as well.  The style is awkward.  The punctuation is poor.  The characters are cardboard figures with the emotional depth of...well, a 16 year old.I don't buy into the excuse that ""Eragon"" was intended for young readers and not for a more critical adult audience.  If anything, standards should be higher for children's literature.  Every book is a learning experience for a child, and the children reading this book are going to learn that it is alright to place your commas is odd places.  They are going to learn that it is acceptable to ""borrow"" your story from other writers.  ""Charlotte's Web"" is a good children's book.  ""Eragon"" is a step below comic books as appropriate reading material for children.So...the author is young and inexperienced.  The publisher probably saw dollar signs when presented with an opportunity to sell a slightly repackaged version of Star Wars-Tolkien-MaCaffrey.  But where was the editor?  Surely, there must have been an editor who could have coached Paolini through some of the more obvious flaws in the book.In summary, the author should be congratulated for his industry.  The publisher should be sued.  The editor should be fired.",0,0

R9UJRY4IWA1O,"I am a big Harriet Evans fan and I don't think she gets the recognition she deserves.

The thing is, Eve hasn't been seen for years and Sophie sets out to find her...I hated that the book was set mainly in America and I thought It was all very cliched. I aren't a big fan of mixed timeframe novels and this was no exception. I couldn't work out when it was a chapter by Eve and when it was one by Sophie.The sections when Sophie filmed in England, were so old fashioned. They could easily have been set in the 1950's. I didn't understand what was happening half the time, especially with the Eve/Rose scenario. I thought the section with the letters between Don and Eve/Rose were the most boring things I've ever read.This is the worst book Harriet Evans has ever written. I hope she gets back to the standard of her early writing soon or I think this might be the end of the road with me as regards to her books.",0,0
RBZPWXYCK774J,"As the other reviewers point it out, this generic drum did make my printer a lot noisier, which I wouldn't have minded, if it worked as it was supposed to.

Of course the one time I decide to use a generic brand, my printer is giving me problems.  Any time I print, nothing happens.  I physically need to turn my printer on and off to make it print a single page.  The second problem is the print quality.  I now have little spots on the page that's not covered by ink.

R1NWUQOKGNSLEH,"I received a free copy in exchange for an honest review.I am not going to summarize this book because I don't want to waste the time. The book blub does a fine job. I dislike reading reviews that are nothing but the reviewer restating the story and that don't really say why a book is good or poor choice.First the good. This book is very well written. The  plot is well thought out. I did find a lot of LOL humor in it. It is a complete stand alone book .The ending does provide a conclusion without any questions left hanging.Now the things that troubled me. The underlying theme is that promiscuous behavior is okay, because every one does it. Lily, the female lead, is a disaster waiting to happen. Her self-sabotage is frightening. She drinks in excess, she takes dope, and she is promiscuous. I candidly don't think the author did anything to promote this woman as a heroic character, Lily is portrayed as a women bent on self-destruction.I can't recommend this book because such gross immorality should not be promoted. I  hope in future this author will put her talents toward a book which will not be offensive to so many people because Eliza Kennedy really does write very well.",0,0
RJTXIWO7Y40G6,"I recently read and loved THE FALSE PRINCE - it was amazing! TFP was a high-stakes fantasy thriller about a young boy who is competing with several other young boys, Hunger Games-style, to impersonate a long-lost prince & save a kingdom from rebellion. I finished that sucker in a single sitting, blown away by the non-stop action and surprise twists. Immediately, I told myself that I had to get all of her other books, pronto.My library didn't have the sequel to TFP, but it did have books one and two of her other series, Mark of the Thief. Now, ordinarily, the middle grade label would have given me pause, but TFP was labeled as middle grade as well, and it was really good, so I was willing to step out of my genre comfort zone again.I should have heeded my gut's instincts.While MARK OF THE THIEF has a great concept, it lacks the subtlety and nuance of TFP. Nic, the main character, is a slave in Ancient Rome. One day, in a gave, he finds a bulla that used to belong to Caesar and contains the powers of one of the Roman gods. A whole bunch of bad people want the power of that amulet and are willing to do bad things to get it. Because they are bad people.The female characters in TFP - a princess and a serving girl - did not get much ""screen time"" but were still interesting and layered when they did appear. Both had agency, bravery, and hidden agendas that were sometimes at odds with the main character, Sage. By contrast, the two female characters in MARK OF THE THIEF, Livia and Aurelia, were incredibly irritating. Livia is a whiny damsel in distress, sister to Nic, whose only purpose is to serve as a lust object, a bargaining tool, or someone to be rescued. Aurelia, on the other hand, is selfish and annoying, and you can tell she's a love interest because she's one of those ""I don't need a man to live my life!""-type characters, only to be converted from the error of her ways and throw all her plans away as soon as the hero steps on the scene.To the MARK OF THE THIEF's detriment, I recently read a good book about Ancient Rome that also took place in and around the gladiatorial arenas and dealt with corrupt politicians as a theme. That book was BLOOD GAMES by Chelsea Quinn Yarbro. It was written for a totally different audience, but is solid proof that good research and an immersive, well-developed world can compensate for narrative flaws. BLOOD GAMES could be dry at times, but I rounded up for substance.THE MARK OF THE THIEF, on the other hand, has incredibly modern language that detracts from the story. It almost would have worked better if this was one of those time-traveling stories, because Nic sounds like a modern boy. I'd suspect the author was incapable of writing in a more old-fashioned and serious way, if I hadn't read TFP, which had at least a semblance of courtly speech.I got the impression that THE MARK OF THE THIEF wanted to be Artemis Fowl and Percy Jackson, all at once. If that was the intent, it failed. It doesn't have the creativity of Artemis, or the research of Percy, and the tone of the story feels like it's talking down to its young readers. I loved TFP and really wanted to enjoy this, but THE MARK OF THE THIEF just felt like a rehashing of the same basic plot and characters, only watered down and voided of any excitement or complexity.If you're new to this author, start with THE FALSE PRINCE. Not this one. I'd normally give this a one-star probably, except I really liked Caela the griffin, and the last thirty pages of the arena battle.1.5 out of 5 stars.",0,0
RCC49HDY455IJ,Let's make it clear.  When I start a book I will finish it.  To finish this one was a struggle.

R3PAP9W22W6H7R,"Come on now really? Don't get me wrong, this film was very good for what it was but a lot of it served absolutely no purpose than to give the action junkie in all of us a quick thrill. Given the cast at the helm, you would be forgiven for believing that this film could be a bit more than a shallow attempt at a dramatic but action packed film. Seriously, the fact that Morgan Freeman was involved should have given this film a 5 star rating from the get-go but even he couldn't save this shallow travesty. I found myself being both annoyed and confused by this film and hopefully, I'll be able to share in my annoyance and confusion towards this film with readers of my review.Wanted is a story about the definitive nobody named Wesley Gibson (Macavoy). His life is repetitive, tedious, monotonous and every other word in the English dictionary that describes it as a bit dull and uneventful. He works in a job he hates for a boss who's the most annoying person in the world, did I mention she's fat? Well that's apparently pretty important for this bitch of a boss stereotype. He has a girlfriend who's cheating on him with his apparent best friend (brief sex scene with this, woo hoo) and his life just seems to be going nowhere. One day while picking up his prescription of anxiety pills, Gibson is confronted by a sexy vixen (a bit too tough for my liking but there you go) we come to know as Fox (Jolie). She tells him that he's the son of one of the greatest assassins that ever lived and the man that killed him is now trying to kill Wesley. Wesley learns that his Father belonged to a fraternity of expert assassins lead by Sloan (Freeman, I know awesome right? Wrong) and it's now Wesley's fate to join and kill the man who killed his father. He is then trained by the fraternity to make him good enough to take the man down.The whole plot in itself is generally that straight forward; it creates an excuse to have a whole lot of blood and bullets, while struggling to instil a sense of depth in our characters. It is straight forward but as is with most films these days, there has to be a ""clever"" twist at the end to make you think like enduring the whole painful movie was worth it. The big name actors were cool. Morgan Freeman presented his usual casual authoritative character who will take guff from nobody. Angelina Jolie, although I hate to say it as I do think she's a really good actress. Her only obvious purpose in this movie was to look a bit pretty and arouse the horny teenagers watching this. James Macavoy annoyed the hell out of me, for the first part of the film as he just came across as depressing and his annoying screaming did nothing to quash my hatred.The only genuinely redeeming part of this film tends to be the action and the special effects which are involved in such action sequences as are featured within the film. However, even the action gets to a point at times where I just find it a bit exhausting as a lot of it doesn't make sense. A few examples of it not making sense are in the car chase scene in which a Dodge Viper is trying desperately to escape what I remember to be a Dog Food delivery truck. Now at this point Wesley has become pretty freaked out by all the shooting so makes a run for it. Fox, all angered and sexy jumps in her equally sexy and mechanical Dodge Viper and gets Wesley in the car without stopping and travelling over more than 60 MPH without breaking his legs or some part of his spine. The other part is simply how the Dodge struggles to get away from the truck. I guess this can be explained away by just saying it's a movie, but surely the makers could have done a terminator type chase. They could have had the enemy in a big bad and destructive truck and the victims in a sexy, but not too powerful vehicle.Personally, if you're looking for a movie that isn't a waste of real acting talent, then you should seriously look elsewhere. If you're a pre-pubescent child who doesn't like to think too much and likes to look at pretty women who don't think whilst acting, then this is genuinely the movie for you. It's violent, it's a bit sexy and it's slightly cool in some parts, but for the film fan that likes to think and enjoys a bit of depth to their movie, then this is sincerely something you should stay away from.",0,0
R1ERLLWWYV0YH6,"I watched Hayley Pomroy give wonderful promises and make wonderful claims on my local PBS station, and thought, heck, it must work.  I decided to buy the book after reading the claims online, and dozens upon dozens of reviews and some blogs.  I did EVERYTHING I could to do the diet completely right – I read the book from start to finish first, bought the right groceries ($$$!), I journaled (at least the first two weeks), I even took Week 1 as vacation from work – so I could focus on doing EVERYTHING right, cooking and freezing tons of food, to set myself up for success.What a disappointment.  After two weeks I was down a whopping 4 ½ pounds.  You might think, wow, that’s good…. But after reading the book and the promises Hayley made, it was utter failure.  For instance, she has chapters where she specifically walks you through what to expect each of the four different weeks.  When describing week three, she writes, “You’re down 10, maybe 14 pounds [by now]….” (pg. 144) and then describing life after the 28-day diet, she writes, “”If you had much more than 20 pounds to lose, you probably aren’t there yet…” (page 166).  So….that kind of leads a person to expect that 20 pounds is the norm…if not the minimum… doesn’t it??As I wrote before, I set myself up for success in every way I could.  My family was so supportive – my husband did what he could to cook according to my diet (when he happened to be making supper).  After finishing the first two weeks and feeling frustrated, he could tell it, and let me sob for 5 minutes (was that the “deep breathing” I was supposed to do in Phase 3??”).  I ate not so much as an Oreo cookie.  I sat and ate salad and sesame seeds in a restaurant – twice – while my family enjoyed a full-on pizza buffet.  I avoided so much as one French fry when driving through McDonald’s after soccer.  I was, for the most part, a social hermit and missed out on parties, etc. to ensure that I stayed on track.  At the end of the month, I lost a whopping 6 pounds…but a couple of those have already come back, even though I have changed the way I eat (I’m eating in “Phase 3” for the most part; I’ve introduced some wheat back in to my diet, and just a bit of dairy – mostly cheese – no yogurt, no milk, no ice cream).  So much for the ""igniting"" and ""red-hot fire"", etc., etc., that the author promised again and again...Ms. Pomroy, I am not a person to normally call people out….but can you explain this?  I loved the book, loved your prose (you sound like someone I would be friends with…and I’m an aggie too!), you made me a BELIEVER….and I feel like a failure instead.  There are others that have written about their failure / struggle too….WHAT ADVICE DO YOU HAVE for us?  What could we have done differently??",0,0
