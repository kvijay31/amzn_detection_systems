RWSW1IV84L6MT,Wish I could have given it better stars but when I sat down to fill goody bags I was short one pencil.

R1UF6K5K7VQ8PE,"Easily - it is near when a book such as Wilson's Spin can win Hugo award.The book has mildly interesting 'science' story in it and that was the only reason I finished it.  If one wanted to be picky, one would however point out that the ideas in the book are hardly original.The main problem with the book is that the interesting science could be told in a 10-pages long novella, but Wilson decided to make a full novel out of it by padding it by hundreds of pagesof sophomoric writing about puppy love and third rate social observations.  Some reviewers complained here that the main character in the book is not interesting - there are no boring personalities,there are just poor writers.Here are selected examples of Wilson's imagination about the future: tired cliche ""main stream media"" is still in use; people get their news from CNN: really? Does anybody now?We learn about obligatory religious cults, which are necessarily weird.  The description of how a corporation functions is plain childish and it is clear Wilson never botheredto get a real-life experience.I almost gave 2/3 into the book when Wilson felt obliged to retell old joke about broken watch telling correct time twice a day.  Maybe in his mind it passes for great humor?The book is to be avoided at all cost - if you crave Sci-Fi turn to real writers.",0,0,0,0

R3HWW0UGENKK2K,"I was attracted to the book because it aims to cover the whole time period (1776 - present). I am not a historian myself and did not wish to perform independent research on the subject. The book seemed like a major piece of scholarly work. The author went to great lengths to make the reader think that this is a balanced view of history, until we reach the 20th century; it is then that his credibility starts waning, since I have read many different accounts of the major events of the 20th century. e.g. Margaret Macmillan's book about the Paris Peace conference of 1919, ""Six months that changed the World"".He writes a glowing profile of David Ben-Gurion while his account of Mustafa Kamal of Turkey portrays him as a conniving conspirator at best. And that is how most of the 20th century gets covered. US presidents might have made some mistakes but they meant well, while Arab leaders could never be trusted. The fact is that all these figures were trying to manage their volatile environments, while empires were crumbling, any way they could. They were not much better or worse than one another. The things they did had more to do with their political systems (or lack thereof) than their moral superiority. The theme of an enlightened America bringing civilization to the Middle East stands in stark contrast to, for example, America showing up in Japanese waters in the 1850s forcing them to open up for trade at gunpoint (treaty of Kanagawa, one of the so-called Unequal Treaties). That convinced the Japanese that they need a strong military, thereby embarking on their own militaristic ambitions. We all know how that ended. The point is that history is more complicated and inter-connected than to make the simple claim that America became federal and got a navy because of the Barbary wars. Isaac Asimov said: the trouble with logic is that you can prove anything in the world, so long as you make the appropriate assumptions. This is a great example of molding facts to suit one's conclusion.Comparing George Washington to Moses, King George to the Pharaoh, Atlantic ocean to the Red Sea, America to the promised land, 13 states to the ten tribes, a pattern starts emerging where the author goes to great lengths trying to convince the reader that support for the state of Israel is America's moral, civic and faith-based obligation; that many presidents were instructed by their childhood priests (e.g. Clinton) to defend Israel or burn in hell. He is also grief-stricken that an American was imprisoned for spying for Israel (he mentions it a few times in the book). And then I learn that the author is not just an American historian but also a major in the Israeli Defense Forces. I avoid books by a biased party for the same reason that biased parties are avoided as judges and juries: clouded judgment even if they mean well. The author could have mentioned that fact in the Introduction, but apparently, he did not think it was relevant or material information.Describing the 2003 Iraqi invasion, the author declares: ""While Iraq's buffoonish Information Minister, Mohammed Saeed Alsahaf, known to the press as Baghdad Bob, ..."". I have never come across such characterization (buffoonish) by a historian. I am disappointed; many of the things in the book may be true, and yet the half-truths and one-sided accounts make me question not just what he mentions in the book but what he might have omitted. He is a good storyteller though; I'll give him that. May be he should apply his talent to the history of another region of the world, so there's no conflict of interest.It would be redundant to mention instances that have already been mentioned by other reviewers, like the USS Liberty incident, which, evidence suggests, was an attempt to blame the attack on Egypt and get the U.S. directly involved in the 1967 conflict. After reading a few reviews in each star category, one can make up one's own mind about the pros and cons. The reviews on Amazon represent what is great about America: democracy and open debate, pre-cursors to understanding, which is a pre-cursor to the end of hatred. Again, the world is not so simple and yet Humanity has no choice but to try to achieve that goal. All children of the world are innocent and they deserve our efforts towards that end.",0,0,0,0

R1CNXWGC6D6QUT,the hopper on the top of this bill counter is at such an awkward angle. You have to put the stack of bills in at JUST the right angle otherwise they draw in crooked and jam right away. You can’t put more than 100 bills in either or it jams numerous times. Spits the bills out at the bottom quite bad as well. I’d give it 2 stars counting 20s/50s/100s and 1 star counting 1s/5s/10s. It literally can’t count a stack of singles without jamming or throwing an error. I have a royal sovereign bill counter which works 1000 times better for only twice the price but what do ya expect for $69. Would not recommend for any large quantity counting or bundling. It just sits in the closet now as I went over the 1 month return window. Not even using it. Waste of money,0,0,0,0
RLM4EY71EOUDP,"Diana Krall does not have a naturally great singing voice.... but I own nearly all of Diana Kralls jazz CDs and have considered myself a fan of this bright talent for several significant reasons.1. Her vocal PHRASING has been incredible.  Jazz is a difficult genre to sing because the phrasing and the emotion a singer places on certain words or phrases in a song become paramount. Sarah Vaughn, Anita O'Day, Carmen McRae, Billie Holiday and Ella Fitzgerald all had superb phrasing and expressed great emotion in their singing, and Diana became heir to this style and yet had a magical and unique phrasing all her own. It made her a bright young star in the world of jazz.2. Diana has consistantly taken the high road in the QUALITY of the songs she has selected with her producers. The songs she has performed are genuinely classic, timeless and difficult to sing. Diana met the challenge and not only performed them without ""vocal gymnastics"" but respected these songs in the way Frank Sinatra did.... allowing the song to be heard as written by the composer. Lyric and melody intact, yet charming us with a style and musicianship clearly her own.3. Diana's arrangements were thought out, subtile, expressive and appropriate for the song. Superb full-scale arrangements by Claus Ogerman, or simple combos with Diana's signature piano style that carressed the song melody so perfectly.""The Girl in the Other Room"" has NONE of the above. The original songs on the album are not sophisticated nor particularly interesting enough to need great emotion, and they don't get much of it here....  and the lyrics and tone of these tunes seem to be self-absorbed and, funny enough, depressing. The remainder of the songs, though better constructed, do not suit Diana's voice or style, though she has given it her best but she is on very foreign turf here. There are plenty of singers who do this very genre much more justice... Norah Jones, Mary Chapin Carpenter, Sarah Mclachlan, Tierney Sutton, Bonnie Raitt and Rickie Lee Jones to name a few.For ""demanding"" jazz fans who crave those rare albums of sophistication, romance, passion and musicianship in lyric and melody that (Diana has given us in abundance in the past) will find this album a huge disappointment both musically and emotionally. Those who enjoy a simpler style of pop won't mind this album, but would be better served by those mentioned above who perform it so very well. If Diana is indeed experimenting with new styles of singing, perhaps a country, blues or hip-hop album is next? She would perform those just as well... but what for?",0,0,0,0
R2FBYD41QSX4UI,"The author is obviously very successful and the book well rated, so maybe it does contain useful advice.  However, for me this wasn't the right book.  There were a few too many generalisations about boys behaviour, and I found some of the idealistic, structural suggestions (like boys starting school one year later and being in a class with girls one academic year younger) very unhelpful.  When purchasing I was hoping to gain more of an insight into the mind of a seven year old boy, but didn't feel that this book provided that.",0,0,0,0
R12RM59DLROR0J,"Well even after reading the reviews I couldn't imagine Cars 2 being so dreadful after how wonderful the first film was.  My children all enjoy the first film.  However, I was mortified when I saw a car being tortured and then killed!  At this point I was so thankful that my children weren't even interested enough in the film to watch more than 5 minutes and by this point in the film they had lost interest entirely.  While the plot is OK - it is not geared towards the same audience that the previous film had been, and it is quite complicated for young children to follow.  I do not want to explain why cars are being tortured for information to my 4 year, let alone my 8 year old.  I am shocked that this film doesn't carry a PG13.It is unfortunate the beloved characters from the previous movie are almost all left behind.  Further the movie isn't just dark in the sense of the plot, but it is just dark.  The previews on YouTube have the best parts of the movie - stick to those and you won't waste your money or be terribly disappointed.I wish I could take the movie back.

R2BIEXGUH1V9PB,"WARNING:  Spoiler alert.  This review, and many others, contain plot twists and info about the ending.With prolific authors, I find there are three kinds of readers:  Those who love everything unconditionally, those who love the initial product but turn cold when the author doesn't merely write carbon copies of the previous books, and those who are willing to go where the author leads and enjoy the books (or not) on their own merit.  I see lots of reviews here that are in the first two categories, and a few in the third.  This review falls into the third.I came to the Cornwell novels only a few years ago, and have read all the Scarpetta books (in order) and the other Charlotte-based fiction.  I've also read the Jack the Ripper book.  I have absolutely NO emotion about a writer attempting new things.  Some people say ""how dare she"" not write only fiction, or only Scarpetta books, or only serious mysteries.  So, I appreciated what she tried to do with the Isle of Dogs, etc. books.  (Anybody ever heard of Carl Hiassen?)  While I think her Jack the Ripper book has some serious flaws, again I don't have a problem with the attempt.It's true that the Scarpetta books had gotten increasingly dark, especially with the death of Benton.  Some readers are angry about this.  Again, if that's where the author wants to go, I'm willing to go along for the ride.  I did hope, however, that this book would lift some of the cloud, because there's only so much misery and depression a reader can take, when it's about a character who did not start out that way.  There is light at the end of the tunnel, here, but it comes about in a completely bizzarre, soap-opera fashion.The fact that Benton is back from the dead is a lame plot twist that I would have NEVER expected in this series.  It's a tired cliche that is shocking in its very appearance.  Lucy has never been a likable character, and now she's a self-appointed assassin?  And what's with her coming on to her male partner?  If she were to discover she's bisexual, that could be interesting, but the explanation given is unbelievable.The end of the book is sloppy and rushed.  Bev is shot from a helicopter.  Boom you're dead.  Jay and the Baton Rouge woman are supposedly killed out of sight of the reader.  THAT is suspicious in the extreme.  Either it's incredibly lazy writing, or we're being set up for another resurrection or more fishiness with Benton.  No matter how you slice it, I felt as if I missed the last 1/2 hour of the movie, and a friend summed up the plot for me in a few sentences.P.S. The brand-name tossing and status consciousness and the exquisite tastes and personal habits of Scarpetta, Lucy, and Benton got tired along about book 3 or 4.",0,0,0,0
R1FIJ3WU6W60JG,"This printer seemed great. As a gadget hound, I loved the fact that I could just send pictures from my phone, wirelessly, and have them print to the photo tray. Over time, and not very much at that, the printer started coming up with new and inventive ways to not print.About 99% of the time, it won't accept the paper...from any tray. It's so slow to attempt to print as well, so you'll be ready to throw it out the window by the time you've got a picture. Maybe if I fill the photo paper tray all the way...Nope. How about half full? Nope. How about if I only put one sheet of photo paper in there...Nope. How about a printing dance, and a let there still be ink chant? I think that worked...Aside from the fact that it doesn't want to accept any paper into its trays, it drinks ink at an alarming rate. I'm seriously considering an intervention. I've spent about $500 in ink, and have printed, maybe, 50 pictures. If you leave it sitting for a few weeks, the ink will just evaporate, and you'll be another $50 in, just to print that one picture you want.This printer does everything but print, so I'm only giving it one star.Hey, HP!

R32ZRHZ3NUP4YB,"It really should have tipped me off when all the four and five star reviews rave about how much they love Kelly Ripa, but neglect to address the actual book.I cannot consider this a novel. It's a ""cozy"" mystery. I will try the next one, praying Kate White takes reader comments into consideration.I'm not summarizing the book, because if you want a summary, read the one Amazon provides.This book could be hard to stomach at many times, as it is really obvious that White has written Bailey to be a younger, cuter, sexier, and cooler version of herself (based on Bailey's physical description--check out a picture of White--not so hot, but very similar to Bailey) and based on White's idealized general lifestyle (high profile friends, glamorous events, and please tell me what freelancer writing one article a month has NO budget concerns?) Yet, Bailey doesn't come across as young, cute, cool, or sexy. We are simply told that she's ""so hip"" and attractive; none of Bailey's speech or actions reflect it. I was just waiting for Bailey to complain about her arthritis or osteoporosis. No 33 year old acts like Bailey! (And why is every cozy mystery heroine 33, anyway?) She seems frumpy and ugly and totally stupid when it comes to men. However, Bailey naturally attracts every man she meets, fending them off with her ""wit"" and disdain. Come on.Also, why does every cozy mystery heroine have insomnia? God, if I wanted to read, ""At 1:00 the sleeplessness took over, and I finally fell into a light sleep until 5am, only to wake again at 6:30..."" It's already unpleasant enough to not be able to sleep, so why does anyone want to read about it in great detail EVERY night Bailey goes to bed?The other characters were very hard to keep straight (or care about), as none were fleshed out beyond what they wore. Oh, but if a character is mean, rude, or unhelpful, that character is inevitably ugly. But good looking people are ALL cool and nice in the real world, right? (No.)ENDLESSLY describing transportation! This might substitute for the lack of description of Bailey's surroundings if one lives in or is intimately familiar with NYC, but I can't keep reading ""...I walked two blocks to the Lex at 86th...""; ""I realized that the bus would be fastest, and ran to the corner of 5th and Park as the #12 pulled up""; ""it took me 15 minutes to hail a cab going the wrong way""... Too much.And this brings me to the worst part of the book: White feels we need to know EVERY SINGLE LITTLE THING Bailey does. Readers will not think our books are missing chapters if we don't know what Bailey did from noon to 1:30. And everything she wears. Every time she showers or bathes, as well as the water pressure and what soaps Bailey used. Loooong passages in which nothing happens: daily minutia including absolutely nothing and no activity that figure in to the book later, yet we still must read that: ""I put on a navy cardigan [yes, 33 years old and a cardigan is her go-to look], Brown capri pants, and my jeanS jacket [you write a magazine! People call it a ""jean jacket""!] and took the elevator downstairs, where I said hello to Bob, the doorman on duty, and collected my mail. I put my mail in my purse and walked east on Broom where I caught the L line to the Gloss offices. I dropped my piece off in my boss's inbox, looked at the stylists' mannequin wearing a red plaid cape and nothing else, and spent 10 minutes looking at my emails as I charged my phone. I walked out past the coffee station. It had started to rain, so I hailed a cab on 1st, ignoring the family of five who seemed in desperate need of a ride. I returned to my apartment and checked my messages: one call from a telemarketer, two college friends in town who wanted to go out for drinks and Landon wondering if I wanted dinner at his place...""...Oops, almost forgot the food descriptions. Kill me. These aren't delicious descriptions that result in the urge to make decadent, buttery 5 course meals. Instead, they literally include Bailey telling us how she cut the mold off cheddar cheese... then made an omelette! Riveting! And then: what she and every other person orders at cafes, restaurants, or pubs, right down to their (inconsequential) beverage choices; what she scavengers from her one-night-stand's fridge; the butter lettuce in her fridge (then ""I washed my fork and bowl and put the lettuce back in my fridge...""). And I don't care that her fridge is in a constant state of emptiness. I just want to scream, ""Go to the damn store!!! Go buy something to eat if this is always an (again, inconsequential) detail. We get it, Bailey and her non-existent budget always eats out because everyone knows all freelance writers can do that. We get it. It's NYC.As a matter of fact, this book feels like Kate White is living vicariously through Bailey--cooler name, cooler clothes, cooler face, cooler experiences.

RR5EB2P1XZ3YD,"The Publishers Weekly review states that this novel was ""meticulously researched,"" but the reader is left to wonder if the sum total of Mr. Lawhead's research consisted of watching the move ""Druids"" while eating a bowl of Irish stew.  The multiple grotesque departures from historical fact in ""Patrick: Son of Ireland"" already have been chronicled by numerous other reviewers and so I will not bother with repetition here.Some 4- and 5-star reviewers will object that the book is a work of fiction, and should be taken as such.  Fair enough; but to write a book about a real person without apparently even having bothered to look at the original source material relating to that person's life (or possibly intentionally ignoring that source material) is inexplicable and inexcusable.  This treatment of the life of Patrick is similar to re-writing the story of the American revolution to say that it was Benedict Arnold who drafted the Declaration of Independence using Microsoft Word, that Paul Revere rode a hippopotomus on his famous Midnight Ride to warn that the British were coming, and that Benjamin Franklin was a Buddhist monk.Historical fiction is supposed to imaginatively flesh out the unknown back-story and details of the life of a historical figure--NOT to re-invent the essential facts of the subject's life.  ""Son of Ireland"" is merely an absurd farce--sort of a Patrician version of ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail.""

The idea of the book -- chess integrated with the mystery -- is wonderful, but the execution poor.

R3PRDZBZGMRMZB,I am very disappointed in this item.  It is flimsy and my laptop slides off even though I added a grip pad.  I did read the other reviews but I can only agree with the negative ones. A regular bed tray or lap pad would have worked much better. I advise you to read all the reviews carefully before buying this. The plastic is cheap and will break easily and the desk portion doesn't tilt at any suitable angle for using while sitting or in bed (and your laptop will slide off the side). A waste of money.,0,0,0,0
RBFCXWM82JDOD,This would have been a 5 star review if all 5 of the cartridges had been ok. The yellow one only had around 85% of its width dispensing toner despite giving it a good shake to try and even out the toner.A real shame as the rest of the image equality was excellent otherwise. Luckily I still had some toner left in my original HP yellow cartridge,0,0,0,0
RK5XCG56FN4BU,Seemed adequate at first but after two months of moderate use the left side of the drum began retaining toner. When i took it out it looked like that side had come loose so was not properly being cleaned. black blotchy areas occur regularly at 1 inch intervals. Sometimes big toner splotches occur randomly and that has happened since we put it in.

Most of all I wanted to yell at and punch and whip Phillip himself. I don't think I've ever read a worse ""hero."" He wanted her for selfish reasons, the way he viewed things was so stupid it showed he had no common sense, this guy was more like one of those creepy bad guys in romance books, not a hero. I would have smacked him and whipped him myself, instead of yelling how much she hated him, as if that helped her. This book should not have been published. There's not a shred of love in here. No wonder Phillip's mother left her father! How could he possibly think their marriage was fine when she left him to live back in England? His brain was nowhere to be found, just like his decency. And if he shouted at her one more time about respect, I was ready to throw the book across the room. He showed her not an ounce of respect. I read all the reviews already, and decided to just give it a try, while expecting it to be not so good. It wasn't just not so good. It was the absolute worst thing she has ever written. This reminded me of those Rosemary Rogers books or Bertrice Small. Who could ever fall in love with those sheiks? They're so horrible! I don't know why anybody writes romance books about them.

R3H5ID3FHJFQDP,"Before I write this review, I just want to say alot of people will disagree with it but i have my reasons and I will explain in further detail.  First in no way shape or form do I not feel sorry for what happened to shy, it is a terrible story and terrible life to live and am glad that justice was served.  What I am saying though is on the cover it says it is the most shocking story of abuse ever told, well not really if you had 10 other people that were sexually abused and write a book it would look alot similar, really no different to most other sexual abuse cases.  I felt as though through the whole book the author just felt sorry for herself as well.  I was hoping for a different ending where she told us about her life after her abuse, and how she overcame her life and was now helping others.  Dont get me wrong she does have her websie with her sister for support of those abused, but it just seems simple.  I also feel this book could have been written in 10 chapters or less as well.  Shy is abussed, abused again, and again, no one believes her. no one beleves her, gets sent away,, gets abused. gets sent away again is abused again, goes on her own has hardships along the way, they finally go to court, stanley and friends are found guilty, End.  That's pretty much the whole book in a nutshell.  I just have so many mixed feelings after reading this book, I dont really fell warm and fuzzy inside like I normally do after reading a non- fiction book.  If you really want to hear the most shocking story of abuse ever told, I reccomend picking up a copy of A CHILD CALLED IT, by Dave pelzer.  I think thats why I have so many mixed feelings about this book, because I have read daves story and know what is in that book, and what dave has done after is abuse and is such a huge advocate and supporter for people and familes that have been abused where this author does not.  So many mixed feelings, sorry if you dont agree.",0,0,0,0

R1A9VRPIXAMT0,"Janet's got the basis for an interesting series: a wacky, inventive genius, a daring newspaper reporter, and a computer with a personality built into a car. Wait -- that last part seems familiar. A lot of this seems familiar. We get embarrassing stereotype after embarrassing stereotype, compounded with a computer-car that seems straight out of the old TV series (which I didn't watch, so I'm making some assumptions). The leads who should be vibrant are instead flat and lifeless. In fact Our Heroine at times does things that place her squarely in the Too Stupid To Live category. I thought the depiction of the flaming gay guy was particularly demeaning, especially when he suddenly became ultra-John Wayne after a concussion.Where are the original characters one expects from a book with ""Evanovich"" on the cover? Oh, okay, so her Plum series is getting bogged down in stereotypes, too. It didn't used to be that way.As for the book itself, it took me three full chapters before I felt as if I were interested enough to keep reading. On the whole, it's your average romance (with a rushed ending that didn't make much sense characterwise). Why two stars instead of three, then? Because the name ""Evanovich"" is on the cover. The quality of this book SHOULD be better. I probably won't pick up the next in this series. Why should I? The characters are completely uncompelling.",0,0,0,0

Unfortunately, it appears to be exactly the same as the other fez, with the same problem: The seller smashes the hat flat before shipping it out, which ruins its boxy shape and puts a permanent crease in the fabric. Note that the box it shipped in was plenty large enough to hold the hat in its original un-smashed shape, and was properly padded with air-packs, so it was not crushed during shipping. The seller intentionally folded the hat before shipping it.The hat is good quality wool, and the color is a dark burgundy or maroon, accurate to the picture. But as a reviewer on the Kangaroo fez said, ""The image shows a solid hat. What comes in the package is a folded up piece of fabric. You ruined the hat the moment you sent it out the door.

R23FDMU0HBOLK5,"Morgenson has done a good job of building her brand and she has a very high profile platform (NY Times) to perpetuate that brand.  In order to sell this book she takes the popular perspective (Fannie Mae was a bad actor in the financial/housing crisis) and purports to tell the 'behind the scenes' story.  The problem with this is that she uses that perspective and supports it with selective references, juxtaposing current events with out of context historical events, only choosing one 'bad guy' (where is Freddie Mac in this?) and generally choosing to use only those facts that make for interesting reading.  A few glaring errors occur in the political arena - FYI, Kerry ran for President in 2004, not 2000.An example of her selective references is how she talks about how James Johnson decided to 'grow the portfolio'. Even though this began at Fannie Mae in the middle 1980's (before Johnson arrived), was replicated by Freddie Mac and was being done by every financial company in the world at the time.  She belabors Fannie Mae capital requirements being too low.  Yet at the time they were set the US mortgage market was the envy of the world due to its absurdly low loss rates. These capital requirements, on a risk based capital basis, were the same as commercial banks at the time.  Since Fannie Mae was precluded from investing in credit card receivables, venture capital or other higher risk assets it was consistent with banks to have relatively low capital requirements.  At one point she comments on a CBO study that said Fannie Mae 'only' gave back to consumers 2/3 of the benefits accrued due to their charter.  From a private company restricted by charter to one industry? Only 2/3's? Even though that number can be questioned, how can this not be a positive result?  I wonder how many people would vote for just this arrangement to get that kind of return.The book is replete with oversimplification, selective representation of facts and out of context comparisons.  A good read if you like fairy tales.",0,0,0,0
R2F2FGPXICNPC5,"You can purchase more ink to fill the stamp but just be warned you will need to have that on hand if you intend to use the stamp regularly.The design worked out only took a couple of proofs.

However, I'm no expert so maybe 50 stamps is about the max this stamp can handle.  That will take a long time to verify.I gave roughly 3½ stars due to:1.  The 2 week time-lapse between buying / receiving coupled with the low first supply of ink.2.  Low amount of starter Ink3.

R2JAGMNFPM67M5,"This was a bookclub selection, otherwise I would have never picked it up.  I had no idea that fiction could also be ""self help,"" with a historical bent.In my opinion the fiction was poorly written and there are pages and pages that repeat parts of the story and lessons.The introduction of the main character, David Ponder, his background, and his life, is very one dimensional and very cliche.  It's all described quickly as his past - went to college, business degree, wanted to work for a Fortune 500 company, got married, moved to Dallas, worked at ""a plant,""  has a 12 year old daughter.  His wife worked as a school teacher for 10 years until their daughter was born and is now a stay at home mom, but they have a second mortgage, and no savings when David loses his job and then health insurance for his family.  He gets a fired from his next job at a hardware store for talking to his wife on the phone about their daughter's need to have her tonsils removed and their lack of money to pay for the operation.  Seriously?He takes a drive, crashes his car and goes on a time travel trip and gets life lessons from historical figures.I gave this 2 stars because the life lessons aren't bad.But I have a huge problem with putting words into the mouths of real people that may have never been spoken.For example Christopher Columbus tells David that people think he is crazy because he believes the earth is round - as if he was the first person to think so.  And Columbus tells him that he will discover a New World.  That is not historical fact at all.Some of discussion questions at the back of the book are very self serving for the author.  Basically, change the world because you read my book.Instead, we should ask ourselves the moral dilemma questions - should David have warned Ann Frank that her family would be discovered by the Nazis and that most of them would die if they stayed in the Annex?Should David have told Lincoln not to go the theater?If it wasn't okay for him to change history for them why was it okay for David to tell Lincoln about Chamberlain's charge at Gettysburg, that was a turning point in the Civil War?The book isn't overly preachy as far as religion, but King Solomon and the archangel Gabriel are part of the trip and faith comes up repeatedly.I simply don't believe that people are protected from death until they fulfill their life's purpose.I don't think ""everything happens for a reason.""In my opinion this gives little value to human life that ends too soon especially at the hand of other humans.  Does a child killed in war have no value since he didn't write a diary like Ann Frank?  How do we value human life?  Is it only by their contributions to the rest of society?I also have a huge problem with success being valued by wealth which comes up when David admires King Solomon's throne - wealth = wisdom.And again at the end when David sees his future - buildings he has built, hospital named for his wife, stadium where a man is teaching David's lessons to a cheering crowd and David is famous.IMO - there are good questions we should ask about this story - but probably not the ones the author wants us to ask.",0,0,0,0

R1IX3E6LABQT1Q,"I partially agree with other reviewers--this book is a Douglas Adams copy. But I'd like to say that the lack or originality is *not* what let me down! I'm not about to reject a writing style just because it's been ""done before"". Do you want to copy Adams' style? Do you want to write stories in his universe, with his characters, assuming you can get permission? Dude, go for it! But this book is not an Adams imitation, at least not a complete one. It is missing some things that could have made it a lot more attractive and interesting.First off, I'll admit this up front--I didn't finish it. Yeah, I know--I probably shouldn't even be writing this review. I made it about halfway through, then started speed-reading, quickly scanning every other page until I hit the end. I didn't see anything to convince me to finish it properly. The twist/resolution near the end was about what I suspected it would be, and the author heavily signals it near the beginning of the book. No surprises there.Leaving that aside, the best thing about this book was the world-building and scenery. The author came up with really plausible, wacky things that happen in his future, regarding employment and government and how neighborhoods are arranged. An anecdote about a missing river made me laugh out loud, and the neighborhoods concept is really quite convincing as well as funny: ""Don't laugh too hard--something like that could happen someday!"" It is a finely drawn madcap world, waiting for adventures to happen in it.But these adventures never quite materialize. The protagonist suffers from stolen property, people chasing him for various reasons, and work and legal problems. He is hailed and hijacked from one place to another, shot at by baddies and helped by friends. But I'd advise this author to work on his characterization for future novels, because these friends and enemies are all very flat and blank. Even the wacky bikers are generic. The protagonist also doesn't have any strong feelings about anything that happens, other than ""Get me out of here"" and ""I want my stuff back"". He is faceless, formless and really rather emotionless, other than his affection for surfing. His personal history is vague and only doled out as needed.A case in point: the protagonist runs into his ex-wife, whom he had a messy, guilt-ridden breakup with not too long ago. We are told this in the abstract, with generalizations. A memory of an actual argument, with crying and yelling and pointed accusations, could have brought this man's past to life, but we don't get anything like that. Anyhow, they meet, and she wants him to go home with her and talk, and his reaction is: ""Nah, I don't really want to."" And hers is, ""Well, okay."" Then they leave. The scene is bland and emotionless, pointless, adding nothing to the book. Most of the book's scenes are like this. They left me with a feeling of confusion, of having missed some subtle point. ""Okay, so this event happened. Is it leading anywhere at all?""The plot was as shapeless as the characters. Again, I didn't finish the book properly, so I may have missed something, but up until I quit reading it, it consisted of amusingly random scenes. Odd things happened, for no particular reason, with no real feeling of structure, danger, mystery or suspense. And wacky random things are not enough to make a book interesting, as far as I'm concerned.If I had a magic wand, I'd turn back time, give the author his manuscript and tell him, ""Great world you have here! But the plot and characters are dragging it into the dirt. Characterization not your strong suit? Okay, let's find a co-author for you to work with. With some work, this book could be awesome."" And it could have been! I hope the author can get rid of these weak points in the future. It was a good start! It just doesn't make it to the finish line.",0,0,0,0

I have read the entire Kay Scarpetta Series and  disappointed doesnt even begin to describe what I felt after reading it.. About half way through I was wondering if she even wrote it?  And by the end I would swear she didnt.It read like a soap opera. Jumping from one scene to the other.. Works for T.V. but NOT for books. And the resurrection of Benton? How much more soap opera can you get? And we even had a body and he still came back?? At least in a soap opera if you don't see a body you know that character can come back some day.. So when they do come back from the dead, it is accepted, you knew it could happen. But if there is a body, that character is gone for good.I returned from a book dicussion group this evening and one of the ladies in the group is a fan also and had read the book. As we were discussing it we discovered that we both had done the same thing after finishing the book. We went to our book shelfs and pulled out our other Scarpetta books because we thought maybe we were just not remembering them right? Could this really be a Patricia Cornwell Kay Scarpetta story we just read??The writting style was SO different. Which we could probably have gotten over. But the characters weren't the same people we have grown to know and (some) love from previous books.Ms. Cornwell if you read any of these reviews from fans, I hope you will give up this new writting style for the next book. And we know there has to be one. Please finally get rid of ""The Wolf Man"" He isn't even one of your best villians. Let's get back to the science, mystery and real endings!

R5618AXZ8VDF,"just one question: is there a fantasy writer out there that Mr. Paolini has NOT stolen from?  this book has strung together the work of Tolkien, McCaffrey, Robert Jordan, Star Wars, and Dee[ Space Nine, to name a few.  it's irritating to me, a teenager, that people are saying the reason the author can't write an original book is because he's a teenager.  i disagree.  there are plenty of teenagers who can come up with new ideas --he just isn't one of them.  why was this book published and given so much hype? i don't know.  Tolkien's plot without Tolkien's wisdom is kind of sad.  McCaffrey's dragons without originality is sad, too.  Jordan's mountains and creatures without Jordan's great writing is really sad.

R3ISZPRNHNQZMC,"I usually don't write product reviews, but in this case my experience has been so awful that I just have to try to keep people from buying this product.First off let me say that I didn't pay a dime for this printer, it came for free with my MacBook Pro.  Seemed like a good deal, the wireless feature sounded great, and our other printer was getting outdated.  Got it home, set it up, printed from my Windows desktop and it worked great.  Tried to set it up on my new MacBook, which the printer came with mind you, and there were no drivers for OSX Lion.  None.  HP even acknowledged that they didn't support Lion at the time.  Why would a printer be bundled with a computer that won't support it?  Also, when HP finally released drivers for Lion, the download was over 500 mb.  500 mb for printer drivers?  Not to mention it STILL doesn't work in Lion, whether wireless or wired.So now we've resorted to printing everything from one of our Windows machines, which is still hit or miss.  The wireless function doesn't work at all, even though the printer is online and I can ping it.  Now, even when plugging in to USB the printer is unresponsive when a print job is sent to it.  I've tried all manners of resetting the printer, uninstalling and reinstalling drivers, turning off energy-saver mode, etc; nothing.  Every now and then it will randomly print a document on the first try, but for the most part it just sits unresponsive.Not to mention some of the other problems like the fact that printed pages get shot across the desk onto the floor, it uses ink very fast, and it spends more time running the motors and cartridge than actually printing.To sum it up, I absolutely despise this printer.  I would rather go back to my old dot-matrix printer than use this.  Even if you can get this for free as a promotion I wouldn't recommend it, pay the extra money for a better printer (probably from Epson or Canon).To HP: If you have a representative reading reviews on here, I really hope your next line of printers is more reliable than this.***UPDATE 1/4/2012***In this review I failed to address the issue of ink usage.  The initial cartridges were used quickly, which is typical with shipped cartridges.  As a replacement we purchased the standard HP 564 Black cartridge, installation was easy, but we printed about 60 pages of text on ""fast draft"" and the black cartridge was empty (note the cartridge packaging lists it is good for 250 pages).  After this we tried out the 564XL cartridge, and after printing about 80 pages of text on ""fast draft"" it is also out of ink.  The ""XL"" states that it is capable of 3x the pages of the regular, so 750 pages.  750 pages of what, 1 word on each page?  I actually had a situation where I had to dig out my old printer and use it to print one page since the B210 wasn't capable.  HP, you have officially lost all business from my household in the future.At least the scan feature is reliable on this printer.  If you need a good, oversized scanner, this is the one for you!",0,0,0,0
R14MBDWL2HXI3Q,"I have all my life owned HP printers and I am sad to say that this is by far the worse model they have put out. HP got too ""smart"" on us this time, just look at all the negative reviews and you will find out why. The great advantage that I thought this printer had over the previous models I owned was that it uses 4 individual ink cartridges instead of 1 black and 1 color, which I thought was going to allow me to save on ink. This sounds like a great idea if it weren't for the fact that these cartridges are not like the ones we have been used to all our lives; these cost $10 dollars each and (at least from the black one) you won't get more than 30 normal-quality, text-only pages printed per cartridge. Gone are the good-old days when one could print homeworks, emails, coupons, etc. at home without worrying too much about the ink levels. I also noticed that while the cartridges might still have ink left, the quality starts decreasing quickly until it becomes unacceptable and you will need to change the cartridge anyways; be ready to stock at least 2 of each all the time. Think of this model as a bulky scanner that you can also use to print on emergencies cases, not as a home printer. I find it ridiculous that owning a printer I still find myself having to print at school to save money.",0,0,0,0

R1TDND28JL12RJ,"Since the resurgence of the zombie genre with films like "" Shaun of the Dead ,"" "" 28 Days Later "" and Zack Snyder's remake of "" Dawn of the Dead ,"" George A. Romero -- undisputed Grandfather of the zombie genre -- has come out of the woodwork once every few years to try and either capitalize on or define the current undead movement. In spite of his best intentions, however, he has failed where he has succeeded oh so many times before. First, with "" Land of the Dead ,"" which in spite of being a surprisingly strong return to form, turned out to be a commercial dud, leading into the low-budget reboot of sorts with "" Diary of the Dead ,"" a "" The Blair Witch Project "" spin on the material that only served to smudge Romero's legacy rather than breathe new life into it. This of course serves as the lead-in to his equally underwhelming new opus, ""Survival of the Dead.""Like ""Diary of the Dead,"" ""Survival"" was born of a potentially great idea. Continuing where we left off in the previous film, the undead are slowly taking over the globe. On a remote island off the coast of Delaware, two families are finding ways to cope in spite of their bitter rivalry. One aims to vanquish any and all zombie inhabitants, while the other strives to domesticate and educate them. Naturally, this leads to heavy gun-play and lots (and I mean lots) of badly rendered CGI gore. While this concept is certainly a breath of fresh air, it is hampered by poor execution. Obviously limited by its budget, the film can't help but look and feel cheap. What really brings it down, though, isn't the bad cinematography nor the bad blood (ahem), but rather, the dull script that lacks focus and a clear vision. Whether Romero takes his material seriously or not is never made clear, and in the end, you'll find yourself chuckling at the ridiculous nature of it all instead of chilled to the bone by its characters and their actions. The actors are so wooden and the characters so clichéd and silly that they make their supporting undead stars seem more realistic and interesting by comparison. Is that the fisherman from "" The Simpsons "" leading one of the clans? It might as well be.While Romero can never be accused of making the same film twice, it must be noted that his best days are obviously behind him. While no one can expect him to deliver another "" Dawn of the Dead ,"" I think it's safe to say that no one could have expected him to fall so far from grace. The man deserves respect and his legacy as the king of the zombie film is still intact, although currently crumbling. Hopefully this downward spiral is corrected or else it's best that George leaves his own franchise for dead.",0,0,0,0

R2AE0LZ1ZKX0PR,"The Daylight War was a horrible book, some other reviewers point at the pacing but in my mind it is a combination of things that made it a complete train wreck.  This book focused on Inevera which many other reviewers pointed out was unnecessary and made the pacing of the book slow.  It was a chore to re-read everything that already happened in the last 2 books for a third time. Worst off I found myself not really caring about Inevera and even after learning about her past she still is nothing more than a support character.If you left out the back story of Inevera the rest of the book was still pretty bad.  Mr. Brett completely butchers some of the main characters and what happens with them is a complete travesty.Leesha who was a strong central character in book 1 and most of book 2, becomes a freak show that would make watchers of the Jerry Springer show proud.  One minute she was interested in Arlen, the next Jadir, then maybe she should get back with Gared who had sex with her mother, but you know what lets just have sex with the new count (all the while she is pregnant).Then there is Arlen....I don't even know where to begin.... if you thought the romance between Anikin Skywalker and Padme in Episode II was bad the romance between Arlen and Renna is worse.  Renna is a one dimensional character and there is no logical reason why Arlen fell in love with her except that they were once promised. Arlen seems to be a shadow of himself when you compare him to book 1.  Arlen, who's epic struggle against demons in book 1 and 2 can't hold a candle to the sunlight that is Jadir....it's pretty clear that Jadir is now better than Arlen in almost every way even though Arlen is a legend who eats demons for breakfast/dinner, learns more about magic, can heal instantaneously, turn into mist, has super-human strength during the day, God-like strength at night, etc.  Here's a good example, Arlen's fight against the mind demon ends up killing half the army/town that fights with him, get's him mind raped, and almost kills him.  Jadir's fight with the mind demon is nothing more than a walk in the park, he literally just walks up to the mind demon, yawns and kills the mind demon along with his mimic. The other example brings us to the anticlimactic ending. Mr. Brett spent so much time with the back story of Inevera, the culture of the Krasians which was already visted in book 2, the trailer park like story of Leesha, plenty of other side character exploration including sorid sex-a-pades that by the end of the story he must have ran out of creativity juice for the most important part: The confrontation between Jadir and Arlen. The confrontation that has been building since the end of book 1 barely takes a couple of minutes and Jadir completely tramples Arlen.  Good Lord!!! What a complete let down, even the Count's moment of erectile dysfunction with Leesha lasted longer than this fight.All of these reasons make the book a 1 star affair and I can't believe this is the same author that wrote the first book (Warded/Painted Man).  The first book was great and even with the second book, the series had so much promise but the third one is hammering the nail into the coffin.  Maybe the author can turn it around with the 4th book, since book 3 ended with such a cliffhanger but I can't recommend this book to anyone and I would highly suggest renting it from the library if you want to read it.  I might end up dropping this series since book 3 was such a bitter disappointment.",0,0,0,0

RI6JRTTRNPC6K,"I purchased this mouse board to replace my Rocket Fish Aluminum dual sided mouse board. I do NOT use this for gaming, it's used for precision mouse function of Design/3D building programs. The Rocket Fish surface coating was becoming worn smooth from several years of use with a Logitech M705 Laser Mouse (my mouse of choice). I'm not one for change, so if I find something I like that works well, I stick with it and re-purchase another one when it's time. I was impressed by the ad presentation and claims of the RUDE-220 so I tried one.Upon receiving the RUDE-220, I couldn't help but notice that the rugged packaging was very well designed with considerable thought, very professional. After opening the package, I discovered that the 'FREE! Teflon Mouse Skates' were missing. Missing Teflon mouse strips aside, I still couldn't wait to try this thing out. The first thing I did was to wipe down the new board with some LCD screen/lens cleaner to remove any residue from the surface.The board is very nicely constructed with a fully bonded, non-skid rubber back over the entire area, not just 4 rubber feet as with similar boards. The mouse surface is completely bonded to the metal core which provides for extreme durability. Noticing that the metal core has been fabricated with radiused edges, gives a nice finished appearance with no sharp edges. I also discovered that this particular board is 'crowned' (curved/bowed) top to bottom, which means that the board does not sit perfectly flat on my desk, with a slight gap on the bottom. Because this 'crown' is so slight, performance of the board should not be affected.After taking the Logitech M705 mouse for a test drive on the new mouse board, I was very disappointed. There was no smooth mouse movement on the 'super slick' surface' as I expected. In fact, I experienced a heavy drag with the mouse on this board. The board's surface feels quite coarse and grainy to the touch, not at all like the 'super slick' surface' that is claimed by the product hype. Based on 35 years plus in the computer field, I feel the performance of this product has left me asking this puzzling question: Exactly what is it that makes this mouse board so special?In conclusion: It's very possible that performance could be enhanced by the 'Teflon Mouse Skates' that were omitted from my package. However, until I can verify this with the proper Teflon strips provided by Rude Gameware (seller), it is only a possible solution at best. Until then, I may be breaking out my old Rocket Fish mouse board, which has a much smoother and slicker surface.UPDATE 12/21/14: I have continued to use the board since posting my review and have found that the mouse surface seems to be getting smoother with use. Although I'm somewhat skeptical about thesurface improvement in such a short period of time, it is now far better than when I first posted results, which was yesterday 12/20/14.I will post further updates on surface performance as necessary.UPDATE 1/2/15: The tracking surface of this board has improved greatly and is now the accurate and smooth surface that I expected it to be. I'm still puzzled as to why the 'break in time' was required to 'smooth out the wrinkles'.Mel",0,0,0,0
R23O02GYU40XGW,"I am puzzled over the generally positive reviews of this book.  There are some interesting anecdotes throughout the book.  However, the general thesis does not seem well supported by the specific examples.  There are numerous factual errors and claims unsupported by the data he cites.  In addition, there are a large number of conclusions drawn from data that seems to support the opposite conclusion.  Much of the book is devoted to providing new names to common behaviors and activities and then attempting to justify the notion that some new truth has been discovered.  I think Ross Johnson, erstwhile CEO of RJR said it best, Gladwell has provided with numerous BGOs (Blazing Glimpse of the Obvious).What I find especially puzzling is the tremendous popularity of this book and his subsequent book ""Blink.""  I certainly am not interested in reading anything he writes in the future.There are far better ways to spend 4-5 hours of your life than reading this book.",0,0,1,1
R1LSA55YBW419Y,"A truly dismal movie, The Matrix Revolutions fails on all fronts, except maybe computer processor time used for the CGI.  The Matrix was an excellent sci-fi movie, and the disappointing mess of The Matrix Reloaded at least hinted at something cool happening in Part 3.  Well, we've got Part 3, and it stinks.The acting has gotten progressively worse, the effects vary from awe-inspiring to lamer than old Star Trek movies, the story just kind of fizzles out like a bad beer fart, and all the potential plot twist coolness hinted at in The Matrix Reloaded is fortotten about in favor of a straightforward and numbingly dumb ending.This is a bad ending to a series that should have never been made beyond the first film.  It is now clear in retrospect that the W brothers really had no clue what to do after cooking up The Matrix, and so just threw together some expensive crap and tied it together with CGI just to turn a buck at our expense.  The Matrix Reloaded and especially The Matrix Revolutions embody all the worst things about Hollywood movies: pointless sequels that replace the original sharp plotting with ""special"" effects and loud audio.",0,0,0,0
R6H89AE67S6YC,"Having just finished reading Eragon I thought I needed to write a more objective review than the, I'm sure, glowing reports, already on Amazon.  Only to find, Lo!  The previous review says exactly what I wanted to say. Had this been written by anyone but a 17 year old, it would not receive the volumes of praise being heaped upon it.  As a 20 year veteran of the high school  English classroom, this is exactly the sort of over-the-top, rehash-every-trope-I've-ever read sort of fiction I'd expect my creative writing students to turn out.  As Paolin matures and develops the confidence to travel into less well-known, more imaginative, territory, I'm sure he'll turn out some interesting fantasy.  As it is, anyone who has read the  fantasy canon will experience deja vu repeatedly as they make their  way through this novel.  One can argue that most fantasy is derivative--Tolkien borrowed from the various world mythologies, for example--but the very best fantasy carries a depth of tone and meaning simply missing here.  Paolin has taken all the fantasy motifs and plot elements (the quest, the sword, the wise elder with a secret past, the dragon/rider bond (stolen from McCaffrey in such a blatant way I'm surprised she can't sue!), etc and simply strung them together with no consideration for the more archetypal meaning.  And the writing style is that of the above-mentioned precocious teenager,  with its purple prose and loaded adjectives:  ""He found a sympathetic Rider, and there his insidious words took root. By persistent reasoning and the use of dark secrets, he inflamed the Rider against their elders.  Together they treacherously lured and killed and elder. When the foul deed was done, Galbatorix turned on his enemy and slaughtered him without warning.""  I was laughing so hard at this point, my fiancee asked me what I was reading.  Suffice it to say that, when Galbatorix wins his showdown with the good dragon rider by kicking him in the groin  (excuse me, ""the fork of his legs"") this becomes not epic fantasy, but farce.Having said all that, if it gets kids to read, more power to it.  And maybe they'll then move on to the really great fantasy: Tolkien and LeGuin and McKillip, and Kay, among others.  Paolin is trying to fill big shoes; given time, I hope he can.  Good fantasy is hard to find.",0,0,1,1
R39LSIYJEKYSM2,"Update March 22, 2014:  The blue ink stopped working on literally the first page I printed that required it. Red and yellow still work, but without blue you also can't get green or gray, so  not such a good deal after all for the color cartridge. The black is still working fine.This was a combo pack including an HP15-compatible black cartridge and an HP23-compatible tri-color cartridge, sold by New York Toner with free shipping.The black cartridge was just in a generic box that said ""Remanufactured Cartridge"", and the cartridge and electrical contacts looked pretty good.The color cartridge was in a box with the ""Premium"" brand name saying ""Replacement Inkjet Cartridge."" The contacts looked kind of worn.When I installed them, the printer (HP Deskjet 810C) would not recognize the color cartridge. (I put the old nearly-empty cart back in with the new black cart, and the printer recognized the old one.) Other reviewers of remanufactured color injkect carts have reported similar problems.I cleaned the contacts of the new color cart, back and bottom, with a rag and some denatured alcohol, and after letting it dry thoroughly, replaced the cart. The printer was happy, and after running the print head alignment routine and printing a test page, so was I.For the price, this is a great solution (as long as they work) and free shipping makes it even better.",0,0,0,0

R1A8VXOSEEKW5X,"Let me start by saying that this product has the impressive distinction of being so bad that I felt a moral obligation to write this review IMMEDIATELY after installing it. I'll also say that I have the full suite of the next level racing GT products that it attaches to, and that, while they aren't perfect, I am a very big fan. The real tragedy about this thing is that it's mostly well built. The whole thing would work fine if not for one unbelievably stupid, inexplicable design decision. That being the way the tray attaches to the arm. The tray is essentially welded to a conical tube that slides over the conical tube connected to the arm. Here's the thing, only the exterior tube is drilled through and you are given a flathead screw and, no tools that fit it, to secure the thing. The result is that the tray flops left and right (as in on the Z-axis) with the lightest touch. As you can imagine a keyboard tray that won't support the weight of a keyboard, or a controller or much else without destabilizing entirely, is basically a paperweight. To you guys at next level racing, please feel free to justify yourselves. I am anxious to hear why you couldn't say... through-bolt the inner tube, or just use a square bracket like the rest of the arm. I'm not an engineer and that took me about 30 seconds to think up and would have cost you virtually nothing. This product would be an insult with a $10.00 price tag. At $80.00, you guys need to go home and apologize to your parents for letting them down.",0,0,0,0

R1BDXWK65JG6J0,"A way for people to get my opinion on the movie is on a this scale  The best movies I'll recommend to my old friends, family, bosses(make'm think you're smart). Solidly average movies I'll recommend to work aquaintances, extended family, facebook friends. A bad movie but I don't care about the time lost watching it, I just forget.  Anything worse, I write a review.To me, the ads for this film made it seem enticing, I was expecting a Nacho Libre sort of fun.  Instead I got a film I'll probably never see again.  Let me say, I'm one of the group still a fan of Will Ferrell. That dumb juvenile comedy is great and would rather see Will Ferrell act than Adam Sandler.  HONESTLY, I don't think I've liked a Sandler comedy since Waterboy (and then I was 10).First of all, I didn't need how they made it an offense to westerns.  I loved westerns and wish there are more today.  I hoped they would use some cliche but c'mon. Spoiler Alert: Why film on such a purposely bad stage? Cheap joke? That's a joke I out-grew after I graduated high school...I just kept shaking my head the whole time.  If Id spent $12 at the movies to watch that- I would've been furious.Second, the spanish story.. the writing is like you took four teenagers and taught them spanish over summer, and asked them to write a story.  You find out when they're finished that they really loved the new spanish curse words they learned.Big spoiler:  Finally the story.  A good parody needs a real honest theme in its backbone. To use a saying, its got to have heart.  I'm half-latino and yes, I even find spanish culture ridiculous at times. Loyalty to family, machaismo, religion, etc.  If they were going to make two brothers fight over honor, let's at least try to make both character's motivation crisply clear. Something real and down to earth, don't half-ass it.  This is the biggest problem of the movie.",0,0,0,0
RBGSU6VKZ92ZO,"It seems to be the fate of second rate fantasy that only with its second or third installment it turns out how bad it really is. The Painted Man was delightful for its choice of villain, the ""corespawn"". The Desert Spear was interesting for again making Arlen Bales suffer, and for his new rival, Jardir, from an entirely different culture. However, there were already flaws: Leesha, a village's herb gatherer, became a sort of Mary Sue, ending up betrothed to a Prince. Book three continutes the flaws without making an interesting own contribution. Brett uses a ASOIAF style POV system, but much more clumsily. While in the first part we have mainly Renna's POV and Inevera's, Renna's is later abandoned completely, and Inevera's bores because the timeline now overlaps with that of book two which we already know. Arlen has only one or two passages for his POV, and others have already commented on his ""dumbing down"": he regresses intellectually and emotionally to an uneducated ""farmer's level"" - but in book two and in Brayan's Gold he had already been Royal Messenger with a formal education, and he is also educated in the Krasian ways (he speaks Krasian fluently). This regress is just unbelievable and upsetting. The chapters are a countdown to the first new moon after the events from book two, since some sort of revenge by the Core is expected at this next opportunity, and it takes about three quarters of the book to reach this point of time in both cultures, Arlen's and Jardir's. But then this event is quickly executed and nothing really exciting happens (a repeat of the Battle of Deliverer's Hollow from book two, really). Finally the book ends with a duel between Arlen and Jardir, which is inventend only on the last ten pages and then quickly set up. - SPOILER - At the end of the duel, both characters fall from a cliff. We learn that (seemingly) Jardir dies and Arlen survives, given his new power of dematerialization. The book literally ends with this fall. Now I love a good death of a favorite character. Most good fantasy has one, it adds drama and allows for a more interesting emotional journey for the survivors. But here, it is nonsensical. Obviously, Jardir is central to the story - why develop Inevera's background if he won't survive? Or Abban. Or Jardir's children. Or his love for Leesha. We have had to read about Jardir on about 800 pages in books 3 and 4 - what for? he didn't do anything really interesting yet. So obviously he is not going to stay dead for long, or otherwise we should feel very, VERY cheated. - END SPOILER - So the whole duel and cliff thing is just an improvised end for a book in which nothing else of interest happens. I feel cheated already, and won't pick this author up again.",0,0,0,0

For someone who has been singing for over a decade and producing hit after hit, she should have known better than to put out something so trite.  Before I hear from all of those who feel people who wrote something negative are ""haters"", let me make something clear.  I am NOT a hater.  I am a singer and a musician and I have been a performer for many years.  I am surely not a hater but I am certainly entitled to express my opinion.  We are all entitled to express our disssatisfaction from an artist who usually puts out good music.  Let us vent. ""smile""Now I've seen Beyonce on numerous shows being interviewed regarding the album and she says that she was speaking in the voice of her character and she wrote songs in accordance with the role.  Okay, that still doesn't explain why after hearing this album, nothing is left with you and you feel very empty.  I stated in my title that even if this was a soundtrack, it would be a bad album.  That is my feeling.  Because to this day I still listen to the Waiting to Exhale and Bodyguard soundtracks and it's timeless. Those albums voiced the character and it was still done with quality.  This is supposed to be her album and not a soundtrack, and therefore, very dissappointing.For all of you that love the album, you have spoke and now I will.I believe she needs to mature in the songwriting department.  The songs are trifling and written as if a teenager wrote them.  The hooks and lyrics are juvenile and doesn't resonate with someone who has been in the music business for as many years as she has.  Also, how many more sexed up songs is Beyonce going to put out.  Enough already.  We are all sexual beings but that's not all we are.  Beyonce would do herself and all the rest of her fans a favor by showing more depth.I am a New Yorker and have been here my whole life and ""us New Yorkers"" were discussing this album and are trying to figure out if this is the only thing that goes on with Creoles in Texas.  We are confused that she hasn't grown up.  I was speaking to women I work with and also hanging out with guys in the barbershop where my brother gets his hair cut and no one is liking this album.  These are her fans.  People are saying that she's trying something different.  This is not different, it's tasteless and shallow and an insult to all of us who love music and have loved her music thus far.I don't want to keep beating a dead horse.  My brother says that this album will go platinum just on her name alone and I was very sad to hear that.  Maybe she needs Destiny's Child or maybe she needs her dad to continue to direct her career again but this album is certainly not something I would buy and am not buying.For those of you who want to hear it, subscribe to Real Rhapsody and for under $10.00 a month you can hear many albums for free without having to waste your money and write reviews like ""Refund"" which surely, if I had bought it, I would be asking for one too.Sorry, can't write anything good about it!",0,0,0,0

R3TX3ONJ4QAY92,"So I bought the lime green one at my local office supply super store thinking all cute dispensers were created equal.  Unfortunately, this one was a disappointment.  The biggest problem I have with it is that when you pull up to peel off tape (and I'm not even talking about a 12-noon angle here, I mean just any kind of up), the whole roll and core pop out of the dispenser and must be replaced before one can carrrrefully extract tape from this thing.  And this is not a sometimes kind of thing.  This happens every freakin time I use the dispenser.  Because I'm stubborn and refused to take it back to the store, I just taped (irony!) some pieces of cardboard over the grooves where the dispenser sits so that it can no longer come out.  Of course, I have to destroy this every time the tape runs out, but otherwise the dispenser would be almost unusable.The other issue that I have is that I don't think it's heavy enough, but that is from a preference standpoint, I think, and less of a universal issue.  Sadly, though, instead of using one hand to grab tape, pull up, and dispense as needed, one must use two hands for the dispenser, pull at a zero degree angle, and dispense as needed.  That pretty much rules out gift wrapping, poster hanging, or any other one-hand-is-holding-this-thing-together activities.  It's a shame, because this thing is really extremely adorable and looks great, enough to get it two stars even!  But I'm really disappointed with it, and until they redesign it, I wouldn't recommend buying it.",0,0,0,0

To be fair he's not given much screen time but he is dull.  Woody Harellson looks bored throughout and Emilia Clarke is a very poor actress with dreadful wooden delivery.  The FX are ok but the production design is very bland and tired.  The train heist is the ONLY interesting moment.  The 3D struggles with the dark and murky look and is not really suited to this sort of film.  If this is the future of Star Wars then it is a a direct to video future at best.

I've used this item every day during my daily warm-up for a week, because I've been away from a piano for a few days.1) The C# on this pitch pipe is very flat.2) The D is very slow to ""speak"" AND is a bit flat in pitch, and the low octave C has a ""funky"" tone.3) The Amazon ""pitch pipe"" site is overwhelmed by presentations of this item, sold under a large number of vendors at very low prices.

R2NEORXHKIB8TI,"The idea of Pixar making an animated film that humanizes automobiles mayhave first seemed an odd choice when the original Cars film premiered in 2006,but audiences seemed to have immediately fallen in love with its family-friendlytestimonial to heartland America, Nascar and the towns and tourist attractionsthat used to line Route 66.Unfortunately, Cars 2 retains none of the charm of its predecessor.  In fact,it's an utter, complete mess of a film that somehow gets turned into a loud,complex shoot-em-up spy thriller that completely ignores all the elements ofwhat makes a great Pixar movie including intriguing story, character developmentand relationships that invoke some sort of emotional investment by its audience.This time around, the film centers upon two sub stories.  The first involvesLightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) who agrees to participate in the championshipWorld Grand Prix race against a Italian Formula One Francesco Bernoulli(John Torturro),  The second involves the good-hearted Tow Mater (Larry theCable Guy) getting cluelessly involved in a spy ring headed up by British agentFinn McMissile (Michael Caine) and love interest Holley Shiftwell (Emily Mortimer)who face off against the villainous monocle-wearing weapons designer ProfessorZündapp (Thomas Kretschmann).One would think that filling the screen with colorful racing cars and fast-editedaction scenes would hold the interest of Pixar's target audience.  However,somehow the story gets totally bogged down with over-the-top violence and jokesthat mostly aim more towards adult audiences than kids (though there is the inclusionof un-warranted toilet humor).  In essence, Pixar has taken the focus away from itslovable characters and put it towards a complex plot that adds to much weightto the film's overall enjoyment.Disney has always been noted for its first-rate transfers and this one is noexception.  The pristine transfer allows for the film's beautifully animated carsto show off their shiny clear-coats. The pure digital transfer shows an unparalleledlevel of sharpness that brings out deep rich rich textures within the animation.Colors are stunning here, particularly in the Tokyo race sequences where brilliantneons dazzle the eyes.  There are absolutely no flaws to be found here.My biggest complaint outside of the film's plot, is its 3D presentation.  Likethe story, it seems to be mostly ineffective and all over the map offeringvarying degrees of depth from scene to scene.  While the process does manageto add realism and make the film somewhat more immersive, one could easilyargue that the 3D adds no real value to this film at all.  Most of the scenes seemquite flat, offering a minimal amount of depth.  The level of depth seems to openup in town shots of Radiator Springs, Paris, and along the winding roads of theItalian countryside.  In fact, it isn't until 3/4 of the way through the film duringa scene inside the London clock tower that one gets the sense that the filmmakerswere making good use of the format with their placement of various objects.  Thisleads to one of the biggest arguments I have been making against 3D as of late....why don't filmmakers make better use of the format?  Theaters and HomeEntertainment companies are charging a premium to watch a film like Cars 2where there is absolutely no payoff for the audience.  With all the props atthe filmmakers disposal, why couldn't some WOW factor be interjected intothe film?  How much more enjoyable would a film like this have been if objectsflew out towards the audience.  Isn't this what makes 3D what it is?  Instead,Cars 2 keeps all its action within the confines of the screen.  There is nothingof WOW value here except perhaps a few fenders attempting to poke outbeyond its boundaries.  As I sat and watched, I couldn't help but be aggravatedover the fact that people paid good money to see a film like this in 3D andprobably walked away extremely dissatisfied.The film has a rather punchy 7.1 DTS-HD track, downconverted to5.1 on my system.  Viewers will find themselves immersed in 360-degreeaudio that places them in the middle of the action.  A great exampleof this is the race sequences where revving engines dash acrossthe channels with a gratifying amount underlying bass while the surroundscome alive with the sounds of roaring crowds.  Dialogue remains stifflyin the center channel as the surrounds give a wealth of support forthe film's effect noises which are well placed throughout with a nicesense of directionality.  Michael Giacchino, who has written scoresfor films like Star Trek (2009), Ratatouille, Up and Super 8 providesa soundtrack that is not only mostly forgettable, but easily gets lostamidst all the noise of the film.Cars 2 arrives as a 5-disc combo set comprised of 3D Blu-ray,2D Blu-ray, Blu-Ray Bonus, DVD and DIgital Copy packaged inlenticular packaging.The 3D disc includes the short Air Mater in 3D, which is asort of light-natured story about Tow Mater becoming part ofthe Falcon Hawk squad while giving us an introduction to theupcoming Planes series.  The 3D is adequate here, giving usnice depth, but nothing eye-popping.The 2D Blu-ray and DVD disc also offers Air Mater as wellas the theatrical short, Hawaiian Vacation.  A Director's commentaryis offered along with the film feature.  The Blu-ray bonus discoffers interactive access to deleted scenes, documentaries,animation and more from different locations in the movie.Cars 2 completely runs out of gas, failing to connect to its audienceon any level.  Furthermore, it's one of those films that could havepossibly been saved by being a satisfying 3D experience, but alas,even fails at that.Only true fans of the series will appreciate the film.  I would expectkids will quickly become bored by the film's complex storyline.  Thisfilm certainly should not be considered for a blind purchase based onexpectations from the original film.  Though at the time of this review,there was only a $7 difference in price between the 2D and 3D offerings,I am uncertain whether the extra expense offers a better viewing experience.",0,0,0,0

R7F6GDO4C4U5O,"As I write this review, California is being threatened with its worst floods in over 20 years.  With total garbage like this movie being produced there, one wonders about Noah’s flood or the Divine Retribution visited upon Sodom and Gemorrah.  What could be the point in producing a show where nearly all the top actors are sleazeballs or neurotics and where no useful message is provided?  Were the producers wanting everyone to avoid going to California for anything?  Was this a message in favor or in opposition to gun control?  All races—black, white, oriental, Middle Eastern, etc.-- are depicted in an unfavorable way. The film is such a garbled mess one has to assume that the writers and producers were themselves under the influence of illicit drugs when they made the movie.  Out of 5 stars, it deserves none, but we have to give some score so it’s one star.My wife and I have seen several of Sandra Bullock’s movies and have enjoyed most of them.  But this has to be the worst movie she’s has ever been in.  Hers is a very minor part that would almost qualify as a cameo.  Maybe she saw the dailies and demanded that she be cut out of most of the movie?  Moreover, the title is wrong.  It should have been called “Trash,” not “Crash.”  Beyond that the film should be rated, “X,” not “R,” for its extreme violence, explicit sex acts, and foul language.  F-bombs are continuous from practically everyone except the 5-year old daughter of the Hispanic locksmith.  In essence, the locksmith and his family are about the only ones we care about as this travesty in film-making comes to an end.Our recommendation is to avoid “Crash” and spend time on other things.  If you go against this advice, heaven help you.",0,0,0,0

They will keep you cooler without making yourself look ridiculous (though if the bloody 02Cool 😎 worked, who cares how it looks?) Another great idea is to use a solar umbrella. They look like regular umbrellas, but they are made out of that shiny reflective material that looks like aluminum foil. Talk about looking odd, but who cares? They work great 👍.

All cartridges are based on a 5% coverage when new.Note:  A 5% coverage is about 6 single spaced lines of text on a page. No bold, graphics or pictures.  A full color photo would be 100% coverage.A ‘regular’ page of text would be about 72 lines and give us 30% coverage (more realistic).  Don’t forget the font type and size you use will use more ink too.Example: 564 Standard Black = 250 pages at 5% coverage.Let’s say your average page coverage you estimate is 30%.  So…250/6 = 41.Therefore the number of pages expected (30% coverage) out of your cartridge would be about 40 pages.A 564 Standard Color (300 pages) at 100% coverage yields – 300/20 = 15 pages.""Each printer manufacturer will be different, but look to see if you can find something like the above or actual reviews that talk about how many real world pages they actually get/print.

R1PWMPX442N8VA,"I love Guillermo Del Toro. For God's sakes, I saw Pan's Labyrinth 3 times at the theater. I've loved every one of his movies and I think he has one wicked imagination. So when I heard he was writing a vampire book I was excited. I just pulled myself out from under the rock I was living in and managed to read it in a day last week. And boy was I disappointed.The Strain was actually not a bad book. I GUESS if you could look past the awkward writing transitions, the painful derivatives and the annoying characters (then again a horror book is meant to have annoying characters, but these were so annoying it was otherworldly) I guess I could say it's an enjoyable one. So why did I give it a one star review?Well that's a good question.First off, it when looked at as a whole, it reads like a cliffs notes of some epic story. Imagine if you tried to condense the whole of the movie Schindler's List into a 50 page comic book, it's that poorly paced. Things happen too quickly, and the fact that there's at least 3 different storylines going on doesn't help either. The book is long at 500 pages yet so much happens that there's not enough time to pay attention to one key detail. They start getting into a key detail then BOOM, let's go to something else. This grated on my nerves.Then there's the writing. I know GDT's native tongue is Spanish, and he does speak good English, but the writing is just... bad here. The grating began in the prologue with the following example:""*insert long paragraph here*'Yes, bubbeh?' he said as he scraped up spoonfuls of his soup.*continue long paragraph*'Yes, bubbeh?' he said as he scraped up spoonfuls of his soup.*insert another long paragraph...*'Yes, bubbeh?' he said as he scraped up spoonfuls of his soup.*...and another one...*'Yes, bubbeh?' he said as he scraped up spoonfuls of his soup.*end of paragraphs! yay!*'Yes, bubbeh?' he said as he scraped up spoonfuls of his soup.""This lasted at least four pages. Someone hit me over the head with a shovel if I'm not 100% correct since I'm paraphrased (if I did it word for word it'd be a novel long itself) but this really grated.There's plenty more examples, including but not limited to:""straight up like Paula Abdul"" (that one particularly made me cringe)""She had that curious rapacity of the newly turned vampire that Eph had come to recognize""""Barnes looked at Eph, now starting to sense something wasn't Kosher""""Nora said, 'They're all like this?'"" (NOBODY I know talks like this)""The heavy door slammed hard, reverberating throughout the entire foundation"" (Wow, that's one heavy door.)""The fleshy tip poked through, straining, almost sniffing at the air as it tried to get at Roger"" (""Get at""?)In all, like I said, I didn't HATE this book.

I'll snap up anything that Patricia Cornwell writes, expecting and enthralling tale.  However, with her latest effort, this was not meant to be.  I was disappointed in the choppy, poorly-interconnected storylines, and the dry, uneventful lives of her characters.  Most chapters last no more than 3 pages, and I was nearly breathless just trying to keep up.  Several times, I found myself reviewing prior chapters because I thought I missed something.  I must agree with other reviewers who feel that this novel is a set-up for others to come.  Unfortunately, this book is a must-read because without it, subsequent Scarpetta stories won't make any sense, and I suffered through it all the way up to the last paragraph.  It lacks Cornwell's hallmarks of storytelling: style, substance, and suspense.  It seems as though she was pressured to sit down and write a novel, at whatever cost, without bothering with the usual in-depth research and story development that we have come to respect from her.  I would like to think that she would take more pride in the pages between the covers, rather than the name on the front.  I am used to a more eloquent Cornwell, and hope her next novel will prove that 'Blowfly' was an isolated case of writer's block.",0,0,0,0
R3MW56KUAYP2A3,"I ordered Gladiator this week hoping for the new version per other discussions & reviews.  Unfortunately, Amazon is still sending out the old version at least in my case.  I called Paramount Home Entertainment (888-889-9456) and they verified my copy I rec'd on Aug. 10 was the old version. They also indicated the old version had been pulled & discontinued. Verification was done by asking two questions: 1) What was the color of the UPC label, yellow not white is the new version, and 2) What is the ID number on the back side of Disc 1 near the center. I had to use a magnifying glass to read it beginning with the letters ""NA"" and ending with ""R1"" for the old version or ""R2"" for the new.

R17LD7SPKPS2GM,"I heard a lot of great buzz about Crash before it was released in the theaters. Here, we were told, was a smart film about racial and ethnic prejudice where the writer/director turns every stereotype on its head and refuses to cater to our expectations. Sounded like my type of film. So finally I bought the DVD and have to say, sadly, that the ambitious theme of a diverse urban group of characters, loosely connected and only slightly developed, showing their small-minded prejudices, biases, and ignorance, looks more like an essay than it does a film. A couple of thug car-jackers lament racism while they brutalize human beings. A white rich woman condescends to her Latina maid and doesn't trust the Latino locksmith. An African-American cop talks racist trash to his Latina girlfriend, making her a stereotype. A white gun salesman accuses a Persian family of being terrorists. A black husband argues with his black wife whom he accuses comes from a family of too much privilege to understand his pain. A white cop hates an HMO supervisor, a black lady, whom he accuses of reaching her position through affirmative action. And on and on. This is really not a film but an essay about tribalism, the reflex to allow fear to rule our intellect. But as a film, the drama consists of watching people hurt each other over and over, relentlessly, usually pointlessly. Worse, the heavy-handed soundtrack, full of tearful laments and wails, tells us to be sad, as if we weren't intelligent enough to know that people hurting and killing each other because of their ignorance and frustration is indeed sad. So in the absence of a real film, here's what you get: Lots of made-for-TV melodrama, descending into bathos. Raw hatred. People screaming at each other. Bombastic, quasi-religious music telling you what sad emotions you should be coddling. Lots of guns. Chase scenes. People spewing racist venom. Sentimentality. Here's what you don't get: A believable plot. Nuanced characters.Needless to say, I was gravely disappointed. If you want to watch a better urban film that cuts back and forth between many diverse characters, watch Robert Altman's masterpiece Short Cuts. For a much better film about urban racism, watch Falling Down starring Michael Douglas.",0,0,0,0

RF7ZGZIW6PYQL,"It goes without saying:  Bram Stoker was a one-book man.  His ""Dracula"" is a classic, and based on two other novels I  have read, nothing measures up to it.Years ago, I found a copy of  ""Lair of the White Worm,"" which I thought was a complete disappointment.  (Even before I began reading the novel, I knew ""worm"" meant ""dragon""--from the Anglo-Saxon ""wyrm."")  As I remember, the novel focuses on a group of people living in a castle; they spend their time drinking tea and talking about a white worm--I mean dragon, who, for some reason (probably there's a curse), visits the castle from time to time and does quite a bit of damage. Obviously, ""Lair"" made quite an impression.  And, I might add, there's a perfectly hideous movie with the same title.  I don't think there's much resemblance to the novel, but, again, what happens in the movie has escaped my memory.When I saw ""The Jewel of Seven Stars,"" I thought, ""Here's another Bram Stoker novel that might be worth a look.""  What concerns me is I'm afraid the unsuspecting will buy the book based on a cover that reads, ""Beware the Mummy's Curse!"" and depicts a woman, I guess the Egyptian queen, who looks as much like an Egyptian as my dog Kimball.  And, she appears to be looking at something glowing in her hand.  Hmmmmm.  I bet it's ""the jewel of seven stars.""  (The artwork--and I use the term loosely--is very cheesy, and this should have been a clue.)Worse, I saw another paperback that was $1 cheaper than this one.  It depicts a scantily clad woman who could pass for a porn queen.  To be blunt, how many people, I wonder, will buy these books based on very misleading covers?  Let the buyer beware!  (I didn't have the nerve to take the second book into my home, though I wanted to buy it.  A buck saved is a buck saved, though I knew  Kimball would be offended.)My guess is that the unsuspecting, who knows very little about Bram Stoker, will be  disappointed.  I found the novel difficult to get through; in fact, I often fell asleep in the middle of a paragraph.  To me, the work is, more than anything else,  a curiosity,  a museum piece.  I thoroughly enjoy Victorian lit, but  ""Jewel"" got a little too tedious at times.  I'm still not sure about the ending.  The next time I'm in the bookstore, I plan to pick up the really cheap edition--if it's still there--and read the last pages, just to see if the endings are the same.  Other reviewers have remarked  there is a different ending.  I would like to see both.Yes, I probably would read another Stoker novel, but I bet I would be disappointed.  If Kimball and I didn't know better, we would never think Stoker had written ""Jewel.""  So, gentle reader, don't beware the mummy's curse.  Beware this ridiculous hoakum.",0,0,0,0

RAK5WO2HLG4YW,"Wow, did I hate not being able to give this vinyl a five star rating, but it's just not that great. To begin with I had to return the first copy I ordered due to a tear on the back cover. The replacement also had a much smaller tear, but I don't think it's possible to get one in pristine condition. The cover is made of a thick paper made to look puffy. It is supposed to smell of marshmallow, but it just reeks. The Stay Puft banner in the corner isn't printed on the paper. It's a cardboard sleeve that won't stay in place. The vinyl itself feels very clunky, and contains the theme song from both Ghostbusters movies. The songs are only on one side, side B being blank. The one thing I truly love about this vinyl is the large holographic pictures of Stay Puft from the movie.

From beginning to end I wanted to leave, but kept thinking ""well, I'm sure some good will come out of this movie"" (none did). Yes-the acting and directing was supurb and phenominal, but the content was filthy! This screams American trash, garbage, and filth all rolled into one! Before I go on I'd like to say happy for those who liked this film and they are entitled to their opinions. And if you have seen this, or going to see this because your favorite actor, director or producer was apart of it, hey, the more power to you. Located in the rich suberbs, Kevin spacey stars as Lester, the husband and father of a disfunctional family, whom from the beginning is masturbating in the shower because his wife is to controoling to be with him. Annette Benning's character is a shallow, phony, snob who ends up cheating on her husband with somebody she works with. Their teenage rebellious daughter sleeps with the neighbor boy who was following them around with a video-camera from the beginning, and she hangs around a filthy-mouthed friend whom the dad tries to sleep with. Then again it was my fault: I didn't know much about the movie, and it was rated ""R"" so I should have known better.

R1R4FZC0Z8H4NC,"The Jesus character demolishes other world religions in a few sentences but extols Christianity partly because, in contrast to those other religions, the Christian Bible contains no serious errors. On page 76, Jesus tells his dining partner, a chemical engineer, that the Bible's account of creation generally comports with the scientific view. The engineer concurs. I suggest the reader at this point put down PERFECT STRANGER and read the first three pages of the Bible. He'd find two utterly different and incompatible creation myths: the Six Days myth and the Garden of Eden myth. Both are absurd from a scientific standpoint. In the Six Days myth, Earth starts off covered in water. In the Garden of Eden myth, Earth starts off parched. In the Six Days myth, plants are created on Day 3, the sun on Day 4, and man on Day 6. In the Garden of Eden myth, plants appear AFTER man and the sun is implicitly there from the start. In the scientific sequence of ""creation,"" reptiles precede birds but in the Six Days myth, birds precede reptiles (birds on Day 5, reptiles on Day 6). In the scientific sequence of ""creation,"" birds and animals precede man. In the Garden of Eden myth, man precedes birds and animals. Thus science contradicts the Bible's account of creation and the Bible contradicts itself. The Perfect Stranger and his scientifically trained dinner partner seem blithely ignorant of both science and the Bible.

R283JNQAWBF30N,"I am a glutton for punishment. I bought this book despite having read both the previous Theodore Boone stories.Those, I notice, who defend these awful books do so on the grounds that they are books for children and therefore cannot be expected to be well written. Maybe, I thought, it is an American thing. Maybe American children can't read well written books, can only manage ""the cat sat on the mat"" type of literature. But that is obviously wrong. After all, it was America which gave us Mark Twain.No, as I have mentioned before, the explanation is almost certainly that Mr Grisham's publishers (like a few of the adult reviewers here) have convinced themselves that the modern American child is terribly dim compared with his ancestors. He won't read a book, they think, unless the prose is horribly wooden and nothing complicated or difficult is to be found in it.And the main character becomes more and more unattractive with each book. I really can't believe that America is full of young teenage boys who long to be goody-goody bores, endlessly pontificating to their peers on the wonders of the American justice system and never doing anything naughty at all.Theo, I am sorry to report to you, is no Tom Sawyer. All red-blooded boys (and probably girls as well) will yearn to give him a good kicking. But Mr Grisham's publishers (I can't believe he is stupid enough to think as they do) are sure that a modern child hero must be a prim, goody-goody who would faint at the suggestion he should ever step out of line.Please, Mr Grisham, get back to writing the novels you are so good at.

I'm a sucker for chicklit (or some people call it women's fiction). But ""I Take You"" is not a worthy addition to the genre. Jane Green, one of my all-time favorite authors, gave this book a glowing review and I just don't understand it.I'm not sure if we're supposed to like Lily, the main character, or not. She's about to get married in a week but in the very first chapter, she makes out with some random guy and then has sex with her boss, who is also not her fiance. How am I supposed to root for a character like that? The book just declines after that. Lily works for a big law firm but you would think she was a 22 year old sorority girl by the way she acts. She's constantly getting drunk or high and being with men who are not the man she's going to marry and apparently that's okay. There are some steamier scenes in the book, so be warned if you're not into those type of scenes.The book is just kind of a mess for me. The plot is weak and uninteresting.

R2NN37A99HXM7S,I wanted to like this paper cutter but the blade wiggles and prevents an accurate cut.  Then I found out replacement blade is VERY costly to the tune of $25 per blade if you can find them.  Attached is a picture of a pack of 3 for $75 I found searching on Amazon.  On a side note: I chose not to buy replacement blades and instead bought the Fiskers cutter https://www.amazon.com/Fiskars-SureCut-Deluxe-Trimmer-152490-1004/dp/B0038F1A0S/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1517852140&sr=8-4&keywords=fisker+paper+cutter it has a triple track (no wiggle blade).

RYEV39C3MRE7I,"The mythical rise of the loner-as-hero which constitutes much of « The Matrix » has certainly attracted its share of reclusive techno-geek types, as the many twists in the plot might have rung a bell or two, encouraging strong identification with the main character ; but, ultimately, the movie carries little food for thought, apart from a bunch of cheapo socio-philosophical concepts thrown together to impress and flatter. The staged rebeliousness, the fight against the « system », the whole concept of the movie is a gigantic smokescreen, a Dr FeelGood sort of thing, that has proven able to keep millions of generous souls soundly asleep, as the world keeps running its reckless course, spinning out of control, like a toy in the hands of a bunch of kids, too stupid and selfish to even bother about anything else than their own amusement. True, the movie  is an apt metaphor of our world. But who are the machines ? « them » or us ? « They » are truly human, after all : greedy, arrogant, and utterly senseless. On the other hand, we have become predictable clockwork mechanisms, rushing to get our share of stimuli. So, basically, we are being fed the stuff to keep us quiet. Don't be fooled by it : understand it for what it is. And remember, as Lenin said -and in that case he was quite right-, capitalists will sell us the rope to hang them. The Matrix, which is, for « them », only a money making machine, might well prove to be that rope, if only anyone could see it. Think about those execs summing up sales figures in their cosy offices. Think about that newly released second episode. You've read the raving reviews ; you've seen the crowds, eager to get their share of « action », desperate to know where the story goes ; you've witnessed friends and relatives, hopelessely addicted to sequels.

R2ITGIXZBBFHRJ,"I wanted to like this pen. It replaced an Inka model that I'd had for years, and which was very reliable, reasonably small, and could open into a full sized pen, comfortable to hold. But the part where it attached to the keyring eventually broke. I've seen other reviews speak to problems with the pen falling out of its holder. I never had that happen, and it's been in my pocket for a year or so. Perhaps there is manufacturing variability, and some grip tighter than others. No, the form factor is fine, it's very compact, telescopes into a reasonably useful length, seems quite sturdy, but the darn thing doesn't write consistently.

R23KF4ASESJO1X,"I have been waiting for a new James Herbert novel for a long time and when I saw that he had written another novel about 'Ash' pschic investigator, I couldn't wait to get my hands on this. I have been a fan of Mr Herberts since I read his first novel ""The Rats"" back in the 1970's.  The intro of his latest story starts off by referencing a very recent but high profile incident which resulted in a fatality. Hmmm. Move onto the the story which starts really well and does get you hooked. Ash is invited to investigate mysterious and gruesome goings on at a remote castle in Scotland.  The story carries you along and it is very feasible until you get half way through the book.  This is where I think Mr Herbert loses it.  He starts to entwine facts from a high profile and very upsetting incident with fiction.  Once a writer introduces 'fiction' based on real high profile, unpleasant facts, the book stops working its magic. If you are writing a historical novel, then you have to give some accurate facts to enable the story to date. However, if you are a writing a gruesome, horror/thriller, it is a BIG mistake to try and do the favourite ""what if..."" writer's start up by using facts and incidents from an unfortunate case resulting in the death of a high profile pesonality. The incident is still too recent and Mr Herbert still makes reference to people who are still alive today and I doubt that permissions were sought before he used them in a fictional work. I think this is where Mr Herbert made his mistake. He removed the 'fantasy element' from the story and I am so sad to say that having got through 3/4 of a book I was really starting to enjoy, totally ruined it for me. I know Mr Herbert can be graphic but this was in genuinely bad taste.

RCAVIM0XEFCUT,"(NOTE: see my update on NeatWorks ver 5 below)I have been using NeatReceipts for a couple of years now.  I generally like the product, but I am now using BOTH the 'Classic ver 1.5.9"" and the new Ver 4.0 software because NeatWorks broke a covenant with its' early adopters.  They broke two of the cardinal rules of product development (1) never, ever, under any circumstances forget your early customers and their data and (2) never remove vital features from the product.First, they ""forgot"" their ""Classic ver 1.5.9"" users.  Versions of the software from 2.0 up thru the current ver 4.1 cannot recognize or import any of the receipts or documents scanned into the earlier version.  I have personally talked to them about this for almost 2 years.  At first, in early 2007, they repeatedly stated that they were hard at work on a migration solution.  We depended on that statement, telling them how important it was for us to be able to access our archived data - for inventories, insurance and tax records.But they finally just abandoned this effort and offered everyone a discount to upgrade to a later version.  How is that going to help with restoring archived data?  The data and file formats for their .elrec and .eldoc seem fairly simple - a scanned image and some recognized text fields.  Why can't they import those formats like they allow for jpeg and tiff images?They offered no acceptable reasons beyond that we are no longer working on that feature and ""would you like to upgrade?"".  They seem oblivious to the frustrations they have caused a large number of their early customers.  We even communicated with Rafi Spero, one of the companies owners.  If he couldn't make it happen, you know they don't care about you as a customer.  BEWARE THIS COMPANY.Secondly:  The ""Classic"" version allowed users to create folders and subfolders, etc.  This was a fantastic way to organize receipts for cash, various credit cards, checks and debits, by year and then by month.  Or to organize a copy of receipts for an inventory by broad categories and then further by store, year or vendor.  So the initial features of both subfolders and the ability to copy receipts from yearly tax records to inventory folders was extremely useful and helpful in elimnating paperwork clutter.The new ver 4 software does not support nested folders or copying receipts to other folders.  Every time you scan a receipt, it goes into a folder.  But all folders are on the same level.  You can show and hide folders, but this is an extremely clumsy process and causes users a lot of extra work in trying to organize their invoices and receipts.  If you want to copy a receipt, you have to scan it AGAIN.  How brain-dead is that?Bottom Line:  This company has proven that, at their convenience, they will ignore or abandon prior versions of the software and remove vital features.To fix some of their current short-coming, as mentioned above, it would not surprise me to see them create a new version of their software that is incompatible with what they are selling today.DO NOT TRUST them with any vital data that you may need in the future.UPDATE:  2-11-2010 - I have been given a preview of the new NeatWorks ver5 software.  I don't know when it will be released but it seems to have (finally) added back in some of the features that went missing with ver 2 and onward.  Now they also have a chance to allow for importing old receipts ("".elrec"" files) from their ""Classic"" users.  If they do Import "".elrec"" files many Classic users will be happy that their data is no longer ""orphaned"".  I will then change my opinion and rating of NeatWorks and their products because they did admit to these past mistakes, listen and respond to their customers and ""the true test of your character is how you respond to those mistakes.""",0,0,0,0

I like the characters, and the interaction between them. I think the director did a good job with symbolization and art design. I think overall the story is great also, and most of the dialogue is pretty good, but there are just a few things about it I just can't stand. * The kid that is supposed to be playing Matt Murdock at the beginning of the movie does great, until he goes blind and gets his superhuman senses. After that, it just seems kind of stupid. * The scene where Matt chases down Elektra, and the two people who had never before met, bust out into a fight in the middle of a park for no apparent reason. * Michael Clarke Duncan looks way too nice to be the Kingpin. There are some other little things that bother me about this movie also. Like where did Matt Murdock get all the money needed to buy all the little gadgets he has?

RKY9MBH3FWVWF,"Up until this point I had looked at IMAX as being the goldstandard for what 3D content should achieve -- that is, untilI had the opportunity to spend some time with Wild Ocean.This is actually my second attempt to review this title.Truth be, about 8 minutes into watching this documentaryI turned off the television and threw my notes in the garbage.There were better things to do with my time, I thought.Over the past day, however, I have been slowly postingin threads warning people not to buy this title and I felt thatif I was going to make such warnings that I should take thetime to explain why I feel this way.  So, into the trash canI went and with crumpled paper in hand this morning I revisitedWild Ocean in order to give it the chance it deserved.Wild Ocean brings us to eastern coast of Africa and takesus beneath the waves into the circle of life.  The problemright off the bat is that the material mostly concentrates onsardines and the predators that threaten their life whichinclude dolphins, copperhead sharks, humpback whalesand of course, MAN.It doesn't take long until you begin to tire of the material.I can't begin to recall how many times I watched schoolsof sardines and swimming dolphins.  Above the water weget some stunning coastal shots intertwined with lots offisherman and dancing natives.So, here are the major problems with Wild Ocean...First is the material.  If this were the first Imax film I hadever watched it might be passable.  However, you immediatelynotice how inferior this is to other titles.  Second problemconcerns the narration.  The narrator talks in a thick accentthat is often very difficult to comprehend.  So many times Ihad to stop, scan footage backwards, and re-listen to thecommentary in order to understand the names of fish andwildlife that were being spoken.The documentary opens with a badly produced 3D commercial,of all things, for Nokia which gives us a preachy message abouthow we can save energy.Finally, and most importantly, is the quality of the 3D.  Forthe first 8 minutes I was suffering from eye strain.  The materialhad an abundance of ghosting and was downright blurry.  Uponsecond viewing I was pleased to see that the imagery got betterthough I stand by my past comments that underwater footagetends to get blurry and out of focus -- especially when there aredebris and water bubbles that constantly divert your eyes fromthe main focal point.The amount of depth and separation is just ""okay"" after seeingother stuff that is so much better. The best 3D here usually comesin the form of the coastal flyovers.  There's a beautiful shot of awaterfall that is seemingly suspended in mid air.There really isn't any ""In Yo' Face"" 3D here.  The best you getis the beaks of bottleneck dolphins slightly protruding the screenalong with a few water bubbles.The audio is perhaps the best feature of the presentation.  It'sa highly punchy, surround-active soundtrack that continuallyenvelopes the viewer with screeching birds, music and watereffects.  At the conclusion of the documentary there is a waterbattle between the sardines and predators with lots of thunderousclapping music and effect noise that barrage the listener fromevery direction.CONCLUSIONThe biggest factors one should consider in what they purchaseis whether the content will be entertaining and whether it is well producedfor 3D viewing.  Wild Ocean is neither.  The 3D is lackluster compared tothe other exceptional IMAX titles that are available and quite frankly, it'sb-o-r-i-n-g to watch.You could do much better.",0,0,0,0

He has a sharp eye and even sharper tongue.  His command of the English language combined with a sartirical and dry wit made books such as ""In a Sunburned Country,""  ""A Walk in the Woods,"" and ""A Short History of Nearly Everything"" a joy to experience. In his other efforts, Mr. Bryson offers unblinking and humorous descriptions of the people and cirmstances around him as his narrative unfolds.  Even his own foibles and misteps are recounted for the enjoyment of the reader/listener. Throughout Mr. Bryson's musings at the expense of others (or himself), there always seems to be an air of ""Bless his heart.""  Critically-minded? Yes.  Mean-spirited? No - that is until I listened to this book.At first I thought it was just because another voice actor, not the author, was reading and emoting the text that the words sounded less dry and witty and more mean and disparaging.

The unit was frozen in the playback mode, so I decided to return it.  The manual was not that well written.  It's OK for the basic stuff but it wasn't that detailed regarding the advanced info, like loop recording.  The strange thing is on the box or in the manual, there is no information written on the manufacture's name, address, website, email phone number, nothing. I guess it's made in somewhere overseas but sold by Silverball through Amazon.  I would have contacted the manufacturer or the service department to get help rather than returning it, but I was afraid I would be stuck with a broken unit.  I read many other good reviews, so may be it's just me and I had a lemon.  The unit is nice looking.  Also, you have to get a micro SD card separately.

R2XEZSGC7F3RW4,"Of course this review will be the small voice of dissent in a sea of praise, but I'm writing for the few who will listen. Okay so this movie was making a statement about what is wrong with America today, it's supposed to deal with the superficiality of the American suburbs, the hypocrisy of family today, blah blah blah. You get all of that within the first 5 minutes of the movie. The rest of it is all rose petals falling and an excuse pass off nudity as ""art"". At no point in this movie was it necessary to for us to see Mena Suvari's breasts. They were totally completely superfluous to the movie. But, hey, this movie is an ""artistic masterpiece"" so, therefore some nudity is required. Every single scene in this movie was the director screaming from the rooftops: ""look at me, I'm making an artistic movie and since many of us aspire to be 'intellectual', i.e. pretentious, we'll praise it because it's 'different' "". What was the point of this movie? Was he trying to get across a message that something is wrong with American society today? If so, he could have done it without Mena Suvari's breasts, the rose petals, and of course the most ""beautiful scene in the whole movie"" - I refer of course that oh-so-profound scene where the the marijuana-peddling voyeur neighbour says that the plastic bag flowing in the wind was so beautiful. Gosh, that statement had me almost emptying my stomach in the wrong way. Ok, I'll admit that at certain points in the movie, I had to laugh out loud, there was definitely some good humour, but most of this movie, was a useless, senseless, pretentious waste of film. So the director wanted to make the statement that something was wrong with society today. Tell me something I don't know. Look for the beauty in everyday life? Sure, but it wasn't anywhere in the movie. Compare this to another movie which wanted to bring home the tragedy of the twisted world we live in - Life is Beautiful. The director of that movie didn't need to show breasts, didn't even need to use curse words and what little violence there was was implied. Yet it brings home to all of us, how cruel and beautiful and complex human beings are. Another good movie which released around the same time - Fight Club. Also a very brilliantly done movie. The best way to get a social message across is subtlety. This movie was as subtle as sledgehammer. All this movie does is take the worst possible in all of us and put it onscreen. Either way, there was no reason for anybody to see Mena Suvari's breasts. Of course this review will just be voted least helpful, but hey, somebody had to be brave enough to criticize this movie.",0,0,0,0
R224Z9RFB6DC1L,"Oh my god this is a horrible piece of junk. I bought it based on the other reviews, but I've been horribly disappointed by both the quality of the product and the customer service of the company. My first unit took a couple of months to arrive. It lasted all of two days before it went into this non-stop beeping mode and could not be reset. I called their support and after listening to it beep they sent out another unit. The next unit lasted about a day and started doing the same thing. I tried contacting them again but they claim to never have received my email. (They received it before, so seems strange that all of a sudden they don't receive my emails.) So, I have to wait for a time when I can call them again. Now they say they can't send me another because it is past 30 days. So now I have to send it in to be repaired. I asked what was wrong with the first unit and they said it was MELTED. They also tell me that I need to turn off the power and unplug it at night because these units melt inside if they're left plugged in. WHAT?? Yep, they say they see melted boards because people leave them plugged in over night. Oh great, that seems like a really solid piece of equipment you're selling that can't stand being plugged in. What a piece of junk. It is too late for me to get my money back. I've already bought a different manufacturers unit and this is just a sad waste of my money. I feel like I've been ripped off.

After a couple of weeks the elastic started getting stretched out from what I'd consider pretty mild use. Then a few weeks later the elastic started fraying and fell apart.I really don't like to write a bad review, but this product is not worth purchasing.If you found this review helpful please click that button and make my sacrifice of wasting time buying this and writing about it worth something.

R1VQKOY5HIXVDJ,"I guess I can understand how a rare few might like this book, but all these reviews are glowing.  I loved Frankenstein.  Shelley's over-the-top romantic style meshed well with the weight of her subject matter and the driving force of her narrative. She told that story efficiently.  The Last Man is completely different.  It's way too long.  The prelude to the beginning of the plague takes up more than half the book. Though it takes place hundreds of years ahead of Shelley's time there is no speculation (other than the abdication of the British throne) about future societies, culture, or technology. The plague itself is poorly described and there are no attempts to explain why suddenly there is plague which is 99.99999999% fatal. Even in Shelley's time, a century before germ theory was beginning to be understood, public health and sanitation were advanced enough so pandemics were not nearly as bad as they had been just 400 to 500 hundred years previous, when the black death wiped out half of Europe.  On top of this Shelley's writing is flowery, excessive and romanticised to the point of ridiculousness.  She manages somehow to be melodramatic and excruciatingly boring at the same time.  Verney's complete isolation at end of the book lasted for about 15 pages. This was the closest thing in the book to interesting. The fascination in the post-apocalyptic is the idea of the experience of the lone survivor or small group remaining alive, concept presented beautifully in books such as I am Legend, Earth Abides, On the Beach, and, of course, The Road.  Mary Shelley deserves credit for writing one of the first or perhaps even inventing the post-apocalyptic novel, which is not simply version of the Biblical Revelations.  This book may have been terrifying in it's day, but now it pales in comparison to the many other volumes in it's genre.",0,0,0,0

I also use these pens for art which includes watercolors that need definition and cartooning. They can be a joy to use. These werw not as bikd as I hoped and the ink tended to stagger early in. What makes me angry however is how quickly the ink ran out. This is a common issue with pens today. I don't pay $3 for a own to write a couple letters and throw it out.

R3OGUWJCQYX6FM,"Nesbo has been billed by some as being similar to Stieg Larsson. Phantom is the third book of the Harry Hole series that I've read and, including Phantom, I've been disappointed twice (liked The Snowman, didn't like The Leopard).The beginning of the book is completely confusing and I almost put it down after 50 pages. Nesbo starts each thread of the story without using any character names and includes the perspective of a rat at the murder scene, which totally lost me. Gusto's (the murder victim) ""dying thoughts"" is one of these threads, which actually does add to the story later in the book, but these segments are a mess in the beginning.I thought things got better through the middle, but slid downhill again as Nesbo explained and then discarded most of the potential solutions to the mystery. There were so many twists (not in a good way), I found myself forgetting whether a certain character had been eliminated from suspicion for Gusto's murder. And, the nail in Phantom`s coffin is that I absolutely despised the ending.

Mary Roach attempts to look at a subject 'scientifically', though how someone who has already decided that anything to do with the possibility of afterlife is false can look at it scientifically, I'm unsure.  She comes off arrogant and smug.  I also get the idea that if she has been presented with any sort of ""proof"", she'd never include that in her book, anyway.  Her religion is atheism, and she holds as tightly to it as any fundamentalist.  All I can say is don't bother.  She rambles from thing to thing, until you want to scream at the lack of continuity.

R23JU6ED9LE2R9,"Just recently I took a moment to look over a few of my reviews and noticed that the majority of my reviews have addressed numerous movies I considered Cant Misses, yet in this I feel the need to warn the public of certain movies that are complete trash not worth watching. The main reason I never took time to write a review about Matrix Revolutions was simply I felt it not worth my or anyone's time to mention. Yet, if you want one here it goes: Throughout the annuls of time and movie production there have been many cult favorites that have spun out a number of movies based on an original idea and concept that took many by storm (i.e., Star Wars, Star Trek, (a number of horror movies with following sequels and Alien). However despite such worthwhile contributions ive always wondered and thought that at some point some producer has either thought or said (and im sure this was Larry Wachowski mindset when making this movie) ""you know what, i have legions of fans, and i bet i could put out any old piece of crap that would take no more than 15 minutes to write on the can and i still bet id rake in millions (poor suckers) (if you want an example please pick up Star Wars Attack of the Clones or Aliens Resurrection or vs. Predator) However if you are looking for the greatest perpetrator of this crime you will find it In Revolutions. Everyone I knew warned me not to watch this movie but due to my dedication to the first two movies (the first especially) I had to see it if for nothing more than closure. OK i will make this as clear as possible, DO NOT I REPEAT DO NOT WATCH this movie, i promise that if you and two friends sit in a room for the better part of 10 minutes you will come up with a better story and i guarantee a  far better ending than what you'll see in Revolutions (but if you are like me and just have to see it for closure rent it or wait for it to come in the five dollar bin at Walmart). I really wish there were words that weren't four letter that I could use to describe this horrid piece of Crap (whoops that's a four letter word lol). I will give it one star only because that's the lowest I can give and I will say the special effects were pretty good. All this movie relies on is action, explosions, big fancy words, and circular logic, hoping to confuse the viewer, and oh yea i forgot, very well possibly the WORSE most NONSENSICAL ENDING ever put to film. I wont go any farther in regard to how bad it is for I feel I have rambled to long as it is all I will leave you with is yet another warning not to waste money on this despicable plot at taking advantage of the loyal fans of the MATRIX.

R2RKH6WCGQLV5R,"While I was out grocery shopping, I noticed this product and figured why not--it was cheap and the brand name sounded familiar. What a mistake I made..First of all, the product smells AWFUL--I didn't expect it to smell like rainbows and perfume, but even with a stuffy nose I almost gagged. I'm 100% sure that if you breathed it in for too long, you would pass out. Being cautious, I only used a little--I scrubbed her everywhere aside from the face/ears.Almost immediately after, I had the most awful headache I've had in years, accompanied by intense stomach pains--I didn't use gloves, but I didn't lick my hands or inhale the product like a narcotic.Through the throbbing headache, I decided to research the company and was horrified by what I found--I can't believe they're allowed to sell products! The chairman and CEO is one of the richest people in the country, and profits daily from products like this. The worst part? A flea jumped off her fur and back on, and she was still scratching--obviously it didn't do ANYTHING against the fleas. It's hard for me to believe that anyone who rated this product highly isn't a Hartz representative--not only did she smell awful, but the product did not work. It didn't kill fleas, but if I had been in contact with any more of it, it would have certainly killed me.There is NO warning label on this product other than 'keep out of eyes'. It doesn't even have directions or instructions, so you don't know how much you're supposed to use. I'm just thankful I didn't use any more than I did--my dog and I are in good health, but it was definitely a wake-up call.**Just as an interesting side note, if you go to the company's official site and click on the ""contact"" page, you get a 404 error. . This was a wakeup call for me--I am NEVER going to buy anything before I do research on it, and will never blindly trust a brand based on name familiarity. They might as well sell anthrax and market it as 'pet flea powder'.**I don't think that Amazon should supply a product like this--given the reviews, I doubt any Hartz products are actually being sold at profit.

R15G8VK8UD51W7,"If you feel as though reviews written for books where the reviewer did not finish reading it are by definition unhelpful, then you should stop here--I did not get past page 6 in THE LOST CONTINENT.Bill Bryson has garnered a fairly positive reputation as a humorist--I've heard his name several time in the last few years, and when I ran across THE LOST CONTINENT second-hand, I thought I would give him a try.  The edition that I found makes it clear that Iowa plays a major role in his 'small-town' America, and, as I was born there and, despite a long period on both coasts, live there now, I suspected some poking fun, because, truthfully, life here is different than it is other places--different in ways that are humorous.There is a type of poking fun that ultimately respects the dignity of the people it describes, and the grade-school type that does not.  Garrison Keillor does a pretty good job of the first; I now have a good example for the second.Bryson writes under the aegis of 'I-came-from-Iowa-so-I-can-mock-the-people-from-there-and-it-will-be-funny-not-insulting'.  After only a few paragraphs, began to sound as though the author had moved away and found himself in a group that snubbed him mercilessly for being from the sticks, and they only way to worm his way into their good graces was to keep them amused by stories of hick morons from back home.I was growing increasingly irritated at Bryson's supercilious tone, when I finally reached this sentence starting a paragraph mid-way on page 6:""Iowa women are almost always sensationally overweight.""  Here is where we parted company.  For the sake of the review, I thought I ought to at least finish the paragraph.  In it, Bryson admits that the teenaged daughters of these women are quite attractive.  'I don't know what happens,' he continues, 'but it must be awful to marry one of those nubile cuties knowing that there is a time bomb ticking away in here that will at some unknown date make her bloat out into something huge and grotesque, presumable all of a sudden and without much notice, like a self-inflating raft from which the pin has been yanked.'If you find that funny and not insulting, then THE LOST CONTINENT might be for you.",0,0,0,0
R379V7F9LD5GP1,"While the setup of this printer was quick and easy it soon failed. In the past I have always had HP all-in-one printers and this was my first Epson unit. I wanted to down size when my 5 year old HP monster died as my home office printing needs have waned. After installing the ink cartridges, loading the paper and downloading the software to my iMac, I printed a couple of test pages and scanned a few documents. All was fine but when two days later I went to scan another document I noticed that the printer was off. After turning on it gave me an error message that it did not recognize any of the ink cartridges and that they needed to be replaced even though they were all still full. One of the things I liked about Epson was that they didn't send the usual ""starter ink cartridges"" that always came with the HP printers, good for only a few pages. While they were not an XL size they were all at least a standard capacity. After I worked around the ink cartridge issue I tried to scan a one page document from the control panel on the printer but the touch screen kept locking up and after a few seconds the printer would just just itself off. After several reboots, including unplugging the unit, and I kept getting the same problems I called Epson. Their tech support was knowledgeable, easy to deal with and they even spoke good English. After just a few minutes they determined, as I had, that my printer was defective and would need to be replaced. I of course opted to return the unit to Amazon and as usual I received great customer service from Amazon and the defective unit was just picked up by UPS on the day after I requested a replacement.

RGQASAX7IIUEW,"The other ""2 Star"" reviews here are correct so I'll say a few things they don't.  First, Branagh is the only actor worth watching.  The rest are cardboard cutouts.  Second, the mysteries really aren't the focus of the plots, instead the story lines involve everyone else giving Wallander crap about details of his personal life, professionalism, etc. and he just lamely takes it.  If it is faithful to the novels, fine, but all episodes feature (a) someone dies, (b) Wallander shows up clueless, (c) Wallander takes crap about his personal life or professionalism, (d) Wallander seems to investigate further as an ""escape"" more than anything else, (e) Wallander takes more crap, and (e) through an accident or two the perpetrator practically gives him/herself up.  Third, this series doesn't stand for anything.  That is, there is no real projection of good or goodness, just bad (typically the evil white man) and people piddling their time away in depressing diversions.  In toto, I find myself wishing that every single character we see just dies.  Including Wallander, to put himself out of his dawdling misery.",0,0,0,0

R2TXFE44Q3TX1F,"With out a doubt there was a lot of issues with this particular production. The story of how this film got made is probably,for most,far more interesting than the movie itself. This movie has be panned and slammed by most major movie critics and repelled by most horror fans as horrific as poodle gone rabid and even then the poodle rates as more scarey !!!However, For those unawares of the troubled productions the studio wanted the film to kid friendly and be able to sell the movie to the teen market. This led to Wes Craven having to film a majority of new footage and re-edit for this market.Furthermore, Mr Craven went all hissy over the CG footage - which when u see it is understandable.With this in mind I tend to think that not all the blame can be throw like a giant furball in the directors direction. When one has a goal in life it is often altered and changed by outsideinfluences and the same can be seen with many movies.Unfortunately for the werewolf fan this is not a film that is made with any love or style. Wes Craven's and Kevin Willamson's mark is felt all over this movie but gone is the overall success of mixing self referential humour and horror that is entertaining and fresh (think Scream).Now don't get me wrong, im not defending Wes Craven as some loyal neurotic fan. I don't think the man is the MASTER OF HORROR nor do I look at every Wes Craven movie as a god sent to the horror world on celluloid. The man in my opinion is classified as the MASTER OF HORROR purely cause he has made or produced so MANY HORROR FILMS. In my books the man has made more duds than successes with both the first Nightmare on Elm Street and Scream being the successes.I've seen his The Last House on the Left which I thought was extremely dated and actually more titillating than really setting new levels of dread and movies such as The Serpent and the Rainbow, Shocker and The People under the Stairs though good but are almostly b-grade in there deliveries. I don't mind b grade but it has to be edgy and fresh to be a true masterpiece.So back to Cursed, the story is simple and I mean really simple. Sister and brother get marked by a werewolf and we spend the rest of the movie watching how their new werewolf genes mix with there teen lives. Thrown into the mix is that both are being stalked by the werewolf. The story line is simply go from point A to B to C to conclusion. All predictable, all wrapped in cheap transparent cellophane.The problem with the film is that it holds no substance and can't decide which genre it wants to fit in, a dark werewolf film , a teen comedy, a teen drama or a post modern horror flicks.It fails at all !!!When comparing the film to other werewolf films it doesn't hold up. An American Werewolf in London has more to its humour and horror than this film ever had and Ginger Snaps is far more post modern werewolf than this scholck.With all that said the film is watchable and will pass an hour a half but you certainly aren't going to remember this film as even remotely mind blowing.Now to the one thing most wanna know: how does the werewolf look??? Well to be honest the CG is not too bad and not too good. It just unremarkable and you are going to have to suspend belief slightly not to be completely zoned out of the movie by some of the fakeness.To but it simply the CG looks cartoony and too sharp to be real (not as bad as the wolf in An American Werewolf in Paris but very close).The costumed werewolf looks...well it looks like what it is...a person in a full puppet suit or a animatronic werewolf head. Overall it doesn't compliment the film.Another aspect when thinking of this film is that there are two copies circulating, one is a pg type offering while the other has some gore.Clearly the unrated copy is the one to get view !!!Unfortunately for most Australians this isn't possible yet as the pg version is the only one available at present down under but hopefully this will be rectified with a Special Edition.In conclusion this is a lite werewolf affair that has been produced and manufactured as a business venture not with true love for the genre or a respect for the horror fan. For me it almost verges on a Wes Craven version of Teen Wolf and even that was a better film for what is was and that saying something !!!!This is one dog that you may stoke once, realise it's a bit mangy and then but down like the bad wolf that it is......",0,0,0,0

R2X7FK9FUZG6PO,"I read all the reviews and decided to try this diet because even those who rated it low lost weight.  I also did lose weight, however, after the first week i basically stayed at the same place.  I have about 50 lbs to lose, so it's not that I am already ""there"".  Basically, I lost weight until the weekend and then gained weight on the weekend.  One of the things that I feel is most frustrating is her lack of any real explanation as to why she is having you eat the things you are eating. She uses terms like rest and restore, but her line is that you just need to follow her instructions and not question her.  Really, that is so insulting.  If there is some studies that support giving your body a break from low carb diets then explain that.  Most of us have gone to ""experts"" who have steered us wrong in the past, so this ""just trust me and obey"" really rubbed me the wrong way.  Some of it I could understand, day 1 and 2, NO FAT, but can have carbs, no fat meats and certain fruits.  Then day 3 and 4, NO carb, NO FAT, only lean protein.  Those are the hardest days for sure, then the weekend comes and you are allowed to have healthy fats, one carb serving and fatty meats, but only a few very select fruits, ( I think you could have peaches but not nectarines).  The thing is, after you finish you really don't know why it's okay to have peaches and cherries, but not nectarines and you are left with no basis to help you in the future.  There is no scientific studies or even links to any studies that would support her ""theory"".  She talks about how she has selected the foods based on their micronutrients, but then you are left wondering how it is possible to get all those micronutrients if you aren't eating everything on her lists of acceptable food choices for each stage.  If I never eat blueberries I am not going to get those micronutrients from an apple, and it's perfectly acceptable to her that I eat the apple instead of the blueberries.  It is almost impossible to follow the diet, it takes so much time and I do cook a lot, we don't eat at restaurants and I use a lot of vegetables, make a lot of complex meals but this was just unbelievable.  She talks about making all your food on the weekend and that would probably be the best way, but be prepared to spend at least one full day doing nothing but that.  The way she has you follow this diet is expensive and wasteful. I really think it could be done using the same principals much more economically.  I believe you would probably achieve the same results using whole wheat bread, rather than spelt or sprouted grain bread; using white rice and plain pasta rather than brown rice pasta and brown rice, and only allowing yourself those carbs for 2 days, followed by 2 low carb, very low fat days, then 3 low carb with any type of fats you want day (including cheese or sour cream which would make the diet so much more palatable). I also think not allowing that one carb serving on the weekends would help with actually losing weight and I've seen a youtube video she makes where she does suggest cutting out the one carb on the weekends if you are gaining weight, so I know this wasn't just my problem.",0,0,0,0
R33VZEAOKPEO3R,"I have owned and used this chair daily, spending many hours each day in it, for more than three years. I think that gives me ample experience with the product, so I decided it was time to write this review.Don't buy it.The Aeron Chair is marketed based on its ergonomics and customizable features. This chair, despite the hefty price tag, does not have most of the adjustability, and unless your body just happens to fit the shape and size of the basic chair as-is, and unless you do not mind the fact that you have no control over the tilt, you will hurt after a while of using it.OK, point-by-point:The chair back - in rest position, the angle that the chair back makes with the seat is too great to contact your back in an upright position for keyboarding, so you may find that you will spend most of your time perching on the chair without any back support.Lumbar support - this comes as a separate gizmo that can be purchased extra, but it isn't furnished with the basic chair.Tilt - The chair tilts, but you cannot adjust the tension, and there is no tilt lock. I repeat, THERE IS NO TILT LOCK. When you lean back, you will lean back very, very far - too far for comfort. Also, the back is not high enough to support your head or neck when you lean back, so forget using that extreme lean to rest your tired back and neck muscles while on the phone. I found this chair to be extremely hard on my neck for these reasons.The armrests - are not adjustable. I am a mere 5'8"" and they are too low for me, so my arms are completely unsupported. Will yours be? If your arms are not supported as you work, you will fatigue more quickly and your posture will suffer. Other reviewers have mentioned taking the chair apart to adjust the armrests. That's a great hack if you can do it, but I will leave it to you to decide if you have the skill and tools to disassemble the components of this chair to make the arms do what chair arms are supposed to do.The seat - the much-vaunted waterfall front of the Aeron chair seems to be either loved or hated. After all these years, I find that I hate it. It places much too much pressure on the backs of my legs, and that quite simply hurts. I ended up putting a cheap memory foam cushion on my expensive chair. (Note, I have the fully-loaded, top-of-the-line adjustable Aeron at work, and in this respect, it is no different. I had to get a cheap cushion for that one too.)The pneumatic height adjustment - works fine. It's nice to have one positive thing to say about this chair.In summary, the Aeron Chair's reputation is staked on its adjustability and good ergonomics, but the basic Aeron has neither.",0,0,0,0

R2F40EZLSMIPQT,"Recent reviewers are baffled by  all the raves this very, VERY mediocre movie has gotten, by both the critics and the teeming masses.  I think the reason for this is along the same lines as where an entire Danish village turned out to applaud the clothing taste of an Emperor who was, in fact, marching around in his birthday suit.From the beginning, we were told how daring and provocative ""Crash"" was.  How it made you really, and I mean REALLY think about racism in this country.  How raw and natural the dialogue was.  How important films like this are to break through the typical Hollywood stereotypes, and get folks to engage in some meaningful discourse.OK....If you say so.  To me, it seemed like a live-action version of the Aaron McGruder ""Boondocks"" comic strip, with actual words substituted for the squiggly lines, stars and exclamation points.  ""Crash""  is a glimpse of real inner-city racial conflicts the same way that ""Baywatch"" shows real lifeguards at work.Here's what I got out of it; (And I'm trying not to write any spoilers.)1.  Big black guy, who's well educated and successful, and browbeaten by his limousine liberal black wife for not being black enough.  He discovers his inner ""Mr. T"", after being humiliated in at a traffic stop.2.  You got a white cop--one of the dudes who bounced on the big black successful guy, who is a racist because his working-class liberal father was a victim of affirmative action, and reduced to invalid status where he is at the mercy of a nursing staff that resemble clerks in the post office, with their compassion and girth.This white cop sorta redeems himself in one of the most contrived movie scenes since Dorothy Oz woke up in Kansas, discovering her whole adventure was just a dream.  (Doggone it!  I hope I didn't ruin that film for anyone.)3.  We also have an East-Asian man, who acts utterly without a conscience in his endeavor to achieve the ""American Dream""4. Next we have the Hispanic guy.  Young, hardworking, father of a cute little girl, and basically an angel in a wifebeater shirt.Naturally....he's menaced by...5. Beverly Hills housewife who's convinced he's stealing from her, and...6.  Paranoid Middle Eastern guy who's convinced he's stealing from him.  (The latter conflict gets resolved in a scene that makes the white cop's redemption seem like a National Geographic documentary by comparison.)Then there's Don Cheadle.  That man can really wear clothes!  Seriously, if he dies before he loses his physique, they should mummify him and use him as a mannequin in a department store.  The Donster plays a Los Angeles detective with a hundred thousand dollar a year clothing expense allowance, who tries to solve the murder of this aspiring black country singer--dude, I'm serious--who in one way or another bumps into the rest of the characters.Conspicuously absent was the black on Hispanic violence that makes up nearly ALL of the interracial fighting in Los Angeles.  Why did the filmmakers do this?  I mean, it's not like the TV stations don't talk about this sort of racial unrest several times a week.Maybe the studio was scared that showing blacks and Hispanics slugging it out would incite real blacks and real Hispanics to start fights in theaters, the way they did in 1979 with the movie ""The Warriors"".Or...maybe the script was written in 1979, and it took them 25 years to get it produced.I gave it TWO stars instead of ONE, because of the black Country and Western guy.  When you think about it, someone will need to fill that void when Charley Pride cashes in his chips and rides to that great big roundup in the sky.""You've got toKiss an angel good morningand let her know you think about her when you're goneKiss an angel good morningand love her like the devil when you get back home""",0,0,0,0

R1SQMC28EOYRG4,"The following review only talks about the features found on the DVD, not the movie proper.""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back"" is an intentionally slapdash movie that deserves an intentionally slapdash DVD treatment.  I'm just not sure that it needed an intentionally slapdash double-DVD treatment.Disc one features the movie, presented in all its crisp colourful glory.  The commentary track that accompanies it, usually a solid staple of all Kevin Smith DVDs, is a real let down.  Only Smith, producer Scott Mosier and Jay Mewes show up.  And what they deliver could best be described as falling somewhere between a vapid Oscar speech and three drunk guys hanging on too long at the end of the party, well past the point when they were amusing.  They basically play a game of ""See how many Askewniverse members you can point out that the audience has never heard of.""  At one point near the end, Smith realizes that they're not doing much more than reading out the closing credits, and wisely says to the audience, ""You could do this yourselves.""  And he's right.  The only shining moment on the track is when Mewes excuses himself to go the washroom, and the second he's out the door, Smith and Mosier good-naturedly rag on him.  When Mewes returns, they reassure him that they said nothing but niceties while he was gone.  That's about the only highlight I can come up with.Also featured on disc one are a couple plugs promoting other entries in the Dimension Collector's Series.Disc two is heavy on the extras, most of which are amusing.  The rest point only serve to point out the fact that there was a lot of good -- and a lot of puerile -- footage left on the cutting room floor.The deleted scenes, titled ""The Secret Stash"" in homage to the comic books store that Smith repeatedly plugs on all his DVDs, function just like the deleted scenes on the ""Dogma"" DVD: they're useless and pointless.  Showing them now only proves why they weren't in the film in the first place.  Most deadly are the unfunny Judd Nelson ad-libs, and Ben Affleck's non-sensically riffing on a scene funny enough on the page.  However, a lot of hilarious Will Ferrell moments are featured (including a delicious improv scene where he and Jon Stewart throw sexually suggestive puns back and forth) proving that in an alternate universe, this would have been his movie.The treasures here are the intros that Smith and friends do, specifically, Jay Mewes' sweetly innocent comments.  My two favourites: at one point, after Smith discusses the problems he had with G.L.A.A.D. before the movie came out, Jay says, with mock retribution, that he's ""not going to send his cheque in this month"" to them.  Later, Smith self-debates whether Gus Van Sant's name rhymes with 'ant' or 'font', prompting Jay to comment, ""Yeah, like do you say tomatoe or potatoe"".  You've gotta love this stoned-out guy!There's also an eight-minute long gag reel, which is of the pretty standard, ""I can't stop laughing"" variety (notable for, once again, Will Ferrell's hilarious straying from the script; this time he's teamed with Jason Lee, who can't keep a straight face).  And you get not one but two behind-the-scenes featurettes.  It's an exercise in redundancy, if you ask me.  The first, produced by Comedy Central, is a rather tame affair.  The second, produced specially for this disc, is not.  It features the no-holds-barred language that is Smith's bread and butter.Two features highlight the work of Morris Day and the Time.  The first features Smith and Mewes learning the band's relatively simple dance steps, before they are called on stage to end the film.  Be warned: the sight of Kevin Smith attempting to dance may scare young children.  The second feature is an exhaustive textual history of the band.  If you ever have to write a paper on The Time, your research efforts will stop here.Finally, in the disc's graphical section, you get an on-set photo gallery, what seems like a hundred different possibilities for the film's poster, and comic versions of Jay and Bob.  The storyboards section is a dubious inclusion, Smith not being noted for his visual flair.  But it does show how wild the Scooby-Doo parody would have been if Smith had had his druthers.Although I laughed lovingly at the movie, despite its lack of desire to raise itself above the sophomoric, I was slightly disappointed by this DVD.  It's a bloated effort, hardly up to the standard Smith and Co. have set by their other issues.  Still, for the Smith completist (and who else would see ""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back"" but a Smith completist), the disc is a necessary addition to your collection.",0,0,0,0

R1ZAA5V6HMZZ09,"The following review contains REALLY big spoilers. Read with extreme caution!I'm a really big phan of the series.I loved the phist,loved the second just as much and thought the third was neat.This is without a doubt the worst of the series.I cannot believe that it's actually part of  the series.I've heard that this is possibly the phinal chapter.I certainly  hope not! This would be a terrible and unforgivable way to end the series  (remember the Friday The 13th series and how they ended it with ""Jason  Goes To Hell""?) Phantasm IV-Oblivion has so many flaws that I don't  where to start,but I'll try. Phirst off,the storyline is extremely  confusing. So many things are happening at once.Reggie fights demon cops  that vomit yellow blood,encounters  girls with silver spheres for breasts  (totally uncreative).Mike meanwhile travels through dimensional portals and  see's images of his previous encounters with The Tall Man.There's just too  much happening all at once! Second,I was surprised by the direction.Don  Coscarelli's  direction is usually excellent,but this was his phirst bad  effort.He doesn't know what he wants to happen,nor how the plot should  move.Third,half of P4 is made up of cut footage from the original  Phantasm.It WAS interesting to see the footage,but it just confused me.What  connection do the scenes  truly have? They basically didn't serve ANY  purpose whatsoever! The ending is one of the worst movie ending ever in the  history of philm (right up there with the ending from Friday The 13th Part  8 if you want the added insurance). Mike somehow is young again,then Reggie  pulls over in his ice cream truck,takes Mike,and that's it!  That's  totally awful! I hated not seeing Reggie and Mike together and Reggie's new  one-liners were really lame. I hate to say this. I really  do,because I'm a big phan of the series and there are many more out there  too.The only things I liked about P4 was the introduction of the new  ""Rambo"" sphere (finally,a new sphere!), the music was once again  excellent (especially the song that plays in the ending credits) and I  liked the phact that we learned that The Tall Man's real name is Jebediah  Morningside.It's about time we knew his real name! Other than that, this is  a terrible movie that's a disgrace to both the Phantasm series and the  horror philm industry. And that is NO joke.The only reason I own a copy is  because it is a Phantasm philm,and I have collected them all.Easily and  undoubtably the worst of the series.Buy Phantasm 1 and 2 (and three if you  must watch a third movie),but try to avoid this (unless you enjoy being  ripped-off).Rated R for very little violence,some bad language and a pretty  strong sex scene.",0,0,0,0
R2Q5FH9W4YE9W1,"Ludicrous. Everyone is a stereotype. I'm a non-white American who's lived in most of the western states, and this is not at all representative. Racism is absolutely still a problem, certainly in LA, but you'd have to hunt long and hard to find a whole string of separate, racially motivated whackjobs this aggressive -- or shallow. The makers of this nonsense give an offensively superficial treatment to a very serious and important subject. It was coldly calculated to get a rise out of people and agitate basically every group without contributing anything of substance. There's nothing in here about change, working for reform, fighting for justice, opening channels of communication, understanding and preventing the causes of racism, etc. It's just an unabashed reveling in ugliness and injustice. Many of the incidents portrayed weren't even realistic in modern LA, and they were the most extreme, most vile kinds of things clearly intended to play on people's emotions. I think many of the people who rated this movie highly did so only to affirm their opposition to bigotry, but the filmmakers should not get a free pass for their attempt to ""cash in"" on a relevant topic that deserves a far deeper and more thoughtful treatment. We can abhor racism without praising people who give cheap, ""token"" nods like this -- and who obviously don't care enough about the subject or take it seriously enough to put much effort into such a project. They just rely on these cheap tricks and then expect a pat on the back. Well, no, they're not getting one from me.",0,0,0,0

R9W9WIMB8U6M7,"You can read this review and more on my blog, Caught Read Handed.Tear You Apart is set in a strange town called Beau Rivage that is full of the Cursed – people who’ve had curses places on them by malevolent fairies, each curse repeated over and over. So you have past Snow Whites and Cinderellas and Sleepy Beauties. It’s a seriously cool concept and I was really intrigued by it. Viv is a Snow White; she knows that her stepmother Regina (WHYYYY would you give her the same name as the OuaT queen??) will eventually order her best friend Henley (given the Huntsman curse) to kill her. I LOVED Beau Rivage, overflowing with curses and princesses and evil stepmothers. It reminded me of Storybrooke from Once Upon a Time, which was a plus. I could have really loved the fairy tale retellings but I couldn’t finish.But there were a lot of things I didn’t like:– The absolutely volatile relationship between Viv and Henley. Viv is jaded and horrible and she toys with Henley’s heart and if he were to want to kill her, she’d definitely be the reason why. She pushes him away for something he might do but then turns right around and cuddles with him. She got on my last nerve and is a big reason I stopped reading.– I liked Henley at first – he was just trying to love Viv – but his obsession with her was creepy and weird.– The darkness given to the story was really cool. BUT why does that have to come with abusive, clichéd relationships (can you say love triangle?)?? The characters are shallow and unlikeable on top of that. Strange that Tear You Apart has great world building and horrible characters.I ended up taking a break from this book 50% of the way through to read something else in the hopes I’d want to finish it after. When I finished that book, I had no desire to pick Tear You Apart back up. And that right there is the reason I had to DNF this one at 50%. We all know that hardly ever happens for me, so I’m really sad about this. It’s also my first DNF review on the blog. I wanted to love this one so much, but I couldn’t do it.I’m pretty sure I know what happens at the end anyway.The bottom line: DNF’ed a 50%. I can definitely see some people liking this one. The retelling is interesting and Beau Rivage is a cool place. I just couldn’t get past the relationships and the MC.NOTE: I was provided with an e-ARC of this book via Netgalley in exchange for an honest review.

Secondly, the holes for the wooden slat that holds the laptop in place when tilted are crooked.... which results in my laptop being sideways if I try to use it. In the video review, the slats appears to fit quite snug, but if I lift my desk it falls right out. I was pretty excited about this purchase, especially after all the great reviews, but I am very disappointed.After my initial review the company shipped me a replacement and emailed me multiple times to apologize.

R1YBYTV0RIUZ86,"The Wachowski brothers take on reality. Obviously it's a subject that should have been treated by someone with more intelligence as the film dissolves into the kind of anti-technological paranoia found in 'The  Terminator'. It's true that the digital FX are awesome, but without a doubt  do not touch the power of The Phantom Menace. The story revolves around a  group of guerilla type freedom fighters who know that daily life is an  elaborate constuct controlled by artificial intelligence also known as The  Matrix. Indeed, in more typical sci-fi fair, the masses are not aware that  they are, well, 'enslaved'. This of course is not unlike the awesome 'Dark  City'.The rebels are lead by Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), a paranoid  Obi-Wan Kenobi type who is searching for 'the One' who will save us all.  This 'One' is Keanu Reeves who acts as artifical as The Matrix. Though I  guess we are not supposed to care he can't act because we feel sorry for  his burden as humanities 'savior' (HA!). With such cool internet names as  Neo, Cypher and Trinity they are distinguished by their just as cool black  leather threads. Along with the obnoxious Techno/Electro rock tracks - it's  MTV perfect.Though the pseudo Zen spiritual hokum and philosophy  (""Human Beings are the cancer of the planet - We are the cure"")  may enrapture 16 year olds across the world, the film is too caught up in  formula to have any real insight - Thousands of bullets fly, good guys  don't get hit, *yawn*. Like some comic book, the fate of the world comes  down to a big fist fight. Indeed, the real star of this film may be fight  choreographer 'Yuen Wo Ping' who did great work with 'Fist of Legend'.

R3PFQT157UG72P,"So I bought these originally to use with my Rocketbook and for my planner and I've been using them for 2 weeks now.First I tried it in my Rocketbook and found that they dry in a thick film.  Not really a big problem until I tried to erase the color.  I did wait a full 5 minutes for the color to dry then I tried erasing with the highlighter eraser and it was gummy and thick and difficult to remove.  I was able to take my damp Rocketbook cloth to wipe it clean away (all of it) but I find it difficult to lift the color off if I only make a small mistake vs erasing the whole page or larger section with a damp cloth.I thought maybe it was maybe the Rocketbook paper so I figured that I could still use them for my disk planner since I use highlighters in it often and if appointments got canceled or rescheduled then I could just erase the highlighter and pens (I use the FriXion gel pens for my planner) and erase it all.  I had the same issue in my disk planner.  tried it on a variety of different types of paper (notebook, printer, cardstock, heavy) and I found I have the same problem with all of them which is disappointing.  On top of that, some of the color doesn't lift out and leaves a faint coloring on the paper (not in my Rocketbook).

When I contacted Comfort Products, they had to send out the post, the seat base and the star (part w/wheels). Each time the chair was unusable for 2-3 weeks. Then I had one time that I thought the wheels were sticking, so I called and was sent a set of wheels. When I flipped it over, I found two of welds had cracked.

RJFL9ZUBH6F6A,"Edit: Changing my review from 4 to 2 stars. After several days of using the pen, it has become less and less reliable to the point that now, to write at all, I have to hold it at a 90-degree angle from the paper, or even upside down on the top of the nib. Also, comparing it to the V-301 Black fountain pen I bought only a few days before, the nib tip seems larger, which explains while it doesn't really achieve the ""fine point"" it's labeled as. I think I'm going to have to give up on this one. The black one is doing fine. They should be identical, so I'm not sure if this one is a lemon or it's a consistent design or manufacturing flaw.For the price, I like this pen a lot so far. It seems sturdy and writes well. It was a little difficult to get the ink started, but after rinsing the nib under the tap, I got the ink started and the pen writes smoothly. My only issue is that it's supposed to be a fine point but I find that it's writing thicker than any other pen I've used, fine or not It's almost like a marker! I can deal with this and once I finish my first cartridge, I'm going to try it with some different ink and see what that does.",0,0,0,0

RZZFPE0T5J7OM,"This is a review for the entire show and not just Season 6.Seasons 1 and 2 of Nip/Tuck were brilliant. And I mean it. I think the writing was one of the best in television history: intelligent, engaging, thought provoking, edgy and just breathtaking. It set the standard for TV dramas and writing in all subsequent years if you ask me. The story lines were believable yet provocative and the topics picked were right at the heart of the matter. Because the characters were written with so much depth, layer and nuances, their struggles were believable and the audience could identify and often sympathize. For the first two years I really believed this to have been the best TV drama I had ever seen.Unfortunately, it all went downhill starting Season 3. I dont know if they changed writers or just got blinded by their success and didnt try as hard, but Nip/Tuck made a downhill run starting in Season 3 until the abysmal failure which was the last season: increasingly improbable, far fetched situations that take the notion of suspending disbelief to new heights, bad to no character development (at least not one that is believable), unimaginative writing that is all over the place, everyone acting supremely out of character...I could go on with more examples. There just wasn't much depth in the characters later on and in fact at some point they became a parody of themselves it seems. The writers took the ""sudden twists"" in plot development that were gripping and enticing in the first two seasons and sprinkled them excessively in every episode to the point where it became almost ridiculous. While in the beginning they used those sparingly to get the desired effect, it was just overdone in later seasons - ultimately causing the show to lose exactly what it tried to accomplish.As mentioned above, people behaving out of character was another prominent feature of the later seasons:Yes, Christian Troy is a womanizer and playboy who loves luxury, hot girls and shiny cars, but he is also a wounded soul, a caring man who deep down has demons to fight while at the same time trying to hold on to certain principles he would never relinquish. In later seasons, they just turned him into a vile, ruthless, unsympathetic, one dimensional animal who is lacking a moral center. While he had some endearing qualities in the beginning, he had none in the end. He was a weak, mean coward who lost his edge and humanity.Sean, who was always the thoughtful, loyal, dedicated and responsible person and especially father, was turned into a big time jerk and sex maniac in the later seasons - a man who had no interest in his family and his children and who slept around and used people.The same is true with most of the characters really. Julia, (Joely Richardson), was a driving force in this series. Her struggles of wanting to go to med school and being more than just a house wife, as well as her subdued, unspoken love and attraction for Christian were an important relationship and plot element. Gradually, she made fewer and fewer appearances, however, became a lesbian at some point (yeah right) - stating she had always been one - and then she sort of disappeared for extended periods of time without explanation or closure. Her passion for medical school and her own life were never even touched upon again and she herself disappeared into obscurity. That was sad, because Julia's presence and the tensions that had developed between her, Christian and Sean were at the heart of the show and its drama. They spent two years building all that up just to drop the subject altogether and never revisit it again.Speaking of unresolved: Gina just completely disappeared at some point without explanation and then came back just to die in the most absurd, ridiculous way you can imagine: she fell during sex out of the balcony. I really thought they were kidding and this was just someone's day dream or imagination but lo and behold, that was it: she really fell off the balcony during sex. Not only was that ridiculous but also sad in a way and just insulting to what the writers had done with the character in the first place. I always found Gina very fascinating and tragic; the self destruction, low self esteem, the fact that she was Wilbur's mother and her battle with HIV. Her character was filled with potential and they just let her fizzle out and then die in this embarrassing, trashy manner. Totally insulting. I wonder what Christian will tell Wilbur when he asks about his mother one day.There is also Kimber, another deeply tragic character who ended up being very underutilized given the potential the writers had with her. They did an amazing job exposing her self destructive tendencies and low self esteem, but then just like that, they dropped her and she too became a two-dimensional paper doll and a cliché. Christian marries her on and off over the seasons, but nothing in their dynamic with each other changes. She doesnt develop as a character for either the better or the worst. I saw a glimpse of hope when she got that abortion and it turned out she could never have kids again - gosh that entire plot segment was filled with potential for her character and the implications of that for Christian - but instead of keeping going on that strong note, they just dropped it and let it fade away. The same thing happened when she died. Did she commit suicide? Is she dead? Is she alive? What exactly happened? We never find out. Her death was not remarkable to anyone - which it should have and could have been had the writers not been so busy making up far fetched bogus stories.There is also that entire plot of Christian marrying Liz. Speak of behaving out of character: Liz always held herself and others to the highest standards. She had a disdain for Chrstian's superficiality and how he used and treated women and she was fully aware of it too. She would *never* have stooped to his level and married him. That was just not her. But they put it in the script and made her whine after Christian and it was ridiculous.If these were changes in plot and character the writers intended, they should have gone about it in a different way (even though there is no excuse for some of the outlandish plot twists they introduced). People dont just change overnight and fiction or not, you still have to adhere to certain rules such as character consistency within a plot. Sean was portrayed from the beginning on as a hard working, ethical, dedicated father. It is completely out of character for him to suddenly turn into a vile jerk who uses women and doesnt care about his kids. Liz would never have fallen for Christian's sweet talk and married him and then pine away after him, that is ridiculous - not to mention that she is a lesbian.Of course it is possible for people to change but there has to be evidence for it in the story and plot and not simply because the script says so. The later seasons are drizzled with even more such inconsistencies, which is a sign of bad writing more than one of just things having changed due to the circumstances the characters find themselves . Acting out of character is not character development.Finally, changing the setting from Miami to L.A. aided in ruining the show completely. The L.A. setting made them be nothing but a bunch of cheap, trashy, run of the mill Beverly Hills plastic surgeons trying to find a way to sell out to the media by humiliating themselves - sort of like the Kardassians. There is some kind of a mystery, sexiness and just boldness to Miami which L.A.'s theme-park commercialism lacks. In the show, L.A. was portrayed as a den for greedy TV producers and dumb people with non-existent moral codes willing to do anything for a dollar, a d-- ck and a dream. McNamara and Troy just became pawns in that scheme and the stories shifted from them to Los Angeles, the dirt of that town and the despicable people roaming it (to the point of stereotyping the city). That was a bad move which, in my opinion, pretty much sealed Nip/Tuck's ruin and reduced its quality to just any other forgettable TV show you hope to end.The bottom line is that after the success of the first two seasons, the show's producers and writers put the characters into increasingly more improbable situations to the point of turning them into clichés of themselves and the show as such; coupled with the issues mentioned above - such as character inconsistency and poor, chaotic plot development - the result has been that over time a serious disconnect has been created and once you have too many of those disconnects, you lose credibility. And I think that is the main breaking point in the end: the show lost a lot of credibility, unintentionally became a farce of itself and with that it lost the edge and brilliance that made it so amazing and intense in the first place.",0,0,0,0

Everyone else has already gone into enough detail, but this box is so cheap and then you make us pay $2.95 and wait at least a month to get a decent box.  Mine already doesn't close properly and I've opened it 3 times.  THREE!

Even if you had made it out of decent plastic with a real hinge, it might have been acceptable, but this stuff is like the plastic they use in disposable Solo cups.  And why the heck didn't you put both on the shelf and see which sold the best--because I could've told you which would've won.  You KNEW it was a mistake based on the fact that you packaged it with a flyer detailing how to get a real box for it (nevermind you could've printed the website address that the phone people direct you to anyway on the flyer).

RH3BTCZ8K8G69,"First of all, there's an amazing review here by ""Doctor.Generosity"" going over the problems with these printers guzzling ink then refusing to do anything until you buy ink. Please take a look at it: http://www.amazon.com/review/RZ9U43V2GQZ2/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JXLGF06I would like to address their reliability. These printers look amazing and work great, for about a year. This printer will print fantastic looking stuff for you, I promise. However, I've owned two other Epson printers, including a WorkForce, which both died in a year, under very light load-- a few pages a day max. Neither printer made it to ITS SECOND REAM OF PAPER. Both times the printers died, I was stuck with overpriced ink tanks I would never even get to use. Both printers jammed and stripped their gears. Making a printer which breaks over a simple paper jam is reprehensible! Epson's response was to offer me a discount on a new printer that would break.We need to stand up to this culture of disposable products that bully us into doing what they want (refusing to scan a document when its out of ink). Your best bet right now is a Brother or Samsung I would think.

Now, I read some positive comments that suggested they worked well, so there are a few good ones out there.  Is it a QA thing?  Does the tip dry up so it won't absorb paint?

R2A25XDWJ4SGRF,"After having read and thoroughly enjoyed Elizabeth Berg's highly regarded, FIVE-STAR-quality ""Open House,"" ""Durable Goods,"" ""Range of Motion,"" ""What We Keep"" and ""Talk Before Sleep,"" I was most anxious to begin ""The Art of Mending.""  The jacket cover describes the book as ""her most profound and emotionally satisfying novel to date...""  I beg to differ.Disappointment set in early on and sadly never made its exit.  The book is stunted, disjointed, lacks flow, and the characters are devoid of depth.  Laura seems vaguely priggish and is always feeling ""uncomfortable"" about things of little consequence.  But when her adolescent daughter Hannah causes a child's injury while babysitting the child, Laura simply says ""I know you feel so, so bad,"" and then ""I know how bad you feel, honey"" without ever advising Hannah that she made a bad and potentially fatal decision with the piggybacking she decided to do with a small child near sharp-edged tables.  THAT'S something to feel uncomfortable about.  Thank goodness Grandma was there to tell Hannah the truth about her decision and not gloss over it with soothing words that don't fit the gravity of what Hannah did with a young child in her care.Then there is Laura's sister Caroline who wants to discuss with Laura and their brother, ad infinitum, how upset she is about childhood events that took place 40 years ago.  I would possibly have put the book away permanently if Laura had made one more silly trip from North Dakota to Minnesota to talk, yet again, with Caroline about her demons.  She flew there, she drove there.  The person who Caroline should have brought to task decades earlier was her mother.  Caroline's method of handling her demons made her an unlikable character who came off as boring, neurotic and self-absorbed.  Mustering up any pity for Caroline's having endured a mother's long-ago egregiously bad parenting might be difficult for even the most warm-hearted readers.The only portions of this book that I found to be enjoyable reading were those focused on quilting and how Laura's clients' personalities helped her in quilt design and themes, the detailed description of her quilting studio and its contents, and her shopping trips to Fabric World.  The book would have benefitted from more quilting tie-ins and less flash-back melodramatics over events that are rehashed, then re-rehashed.",0,0,0,0

R1CFOAD58Z24LB,"Well, that may not be entirely accurate. I shouldn't say that this movie was a HUGE disappointment, simply because I went in with no expectations. And am I qualified to fully review?--since I was so bored with this film  that I walked out of the screening room after an hour? Maybe not. But I  will say this: AM has been called a sharp black comedy, commenting on  current American values. I didn't find the film particularly funny or  insightful (sorry folks--'King of Comedy' and 'Little Murders' w/Elliot  Gould still have more to say about American 'values' than this picture); I  didn't find the story particularly compelling (it reads more like a quiet,  suburban soap opera); and the performances didn't quite jell (the actors  all performed as if in different films, seperate from each other). To their  credit, Spacey (far better in t.v.'s WISEGUY) turned in a rather staid  performance, but this role was low on energy and believability. And I'm a  huge fan of Benning, but I will say that she gives it her all in a film  that is neither creatively photographed nor emotionally gripping, and  certainly doesn't do her any favors career-wise. All in all, it's a pretty  toothless effort from a group that should have been able to produce  something more.  And finally, I can say this: even an episode of FOX's  comedy series 'TITUS' is sharper and more scathing than this weak effort.  Personally, I find it a bit insulting that a British director seems to  think this script qualified as any sort of legitimate contemporary  commentary, especially for someone working inside the 'Hollywood system.'  But I suppose that being a director for the major studios certainly  qualifies him as a keen observer of Midwestern values and the human  condition. Is it any wonder the Bristish no longer have a legitimate film  community? We should have seen this one coming a long ways away, and turned  it back before it reached the shores.

RQK8XIQLF516R,"This movie had a great potential to be entertaining, realistic (enough), and educational on consequences for a country that so often neglects the environment.  The movie started out this way, but the storm seems to almost have a life of its own (that it is almost hunting the main characters).  The movie plays over a few weeks (days? doesn't really specify very well), whereas it should have run over at least months if not a couple years to make it not completely implausible.  By ignoring reality to the highest degree, this movie disgraced those committed to preventing climate change (it made a mockery of it).The movie started out well, suggesting that these things would take time to pan out.  Then, as the story gets going, the timelines are all wrong and the events are cut to weeks and then to ?days?.  The only reason I could possibly imagine that this was done was to try to get an rush for the audience and make this into a thriller movie, not a realistic one.  Because it was so over the top, I and apparently a lot of others who have reviewed this movie lost interest.  Instead of thinking, ""Is this character going to live or die?"" or ""Wow, I can really see this actually happening,"" you say to yourself, ""Are you serious?  Why does the story keep changing?  None of this makes any sense in reality.  Hollywood sold out on an excellent idea for a horrible storyline.""  I could write about several parts in this movie that violated conservation of energy and simple physics laws -- it was done left and right and made the scientists look like idiots.If you don't mind a movie that doesn't necessarily make sense, you will probably like this movie.

The narrative structure is generally poor, as are also some of the author's techniques: frequently spelling out the protagonist's thoughts, providing history lessons via a storyteller without song, or assigning names to places from some fictitious language without actually developing that language (better to assign descriptive or evocative names in English, then).  If I had read this book when I was a kid, I might have overlooked some of these problems and enjoyed it nonetheless.  Probably, many kids are doing that now.  However, the book will definitely have very limited appeal for adults who have a taste for well-crafted, original fantasy.",0,0,0,0

R27CB429LFYTVM,"I'm disappointed in these screen protectors; part of the problem is the protectors themselves and part of the problem is Amazon.In my research, I've found there are two distinct types of screen protectors.  One type is a hard film with an adhesive backing.  When I've purchased these in the past (for other phones), the protector came with both a front and back layer to peel off; the front layer was rigid and the back layer protected the adhesive.  To apply, you peel off the back layer; the rigid front layer makes it easy to apply onto the phone.  You then peel off the front rigid layer and you are left simply with the protector covering the phone's screen.  This is the type of protector I wanted to purchase.The second kind of protector is a much softer plastic, almost like a vinyl.  There is no adhesive on this protector; the vinyl simply adheres to the screen.  This type tends to be harder to apply since there is nothing rigid to hold it straight while you are applying it.  I did not want to purchase this type of protector.  They are much harder to apply and they get many more bubbles underneath than the first type of protector.Reading the description of the protector and the other Amazon reviews, I was led to believe I would be purchasing the first type.  Unfortunately, due to the marketplace vendor I chose, I received the second type.This happens because the product listing is so broad (LCD screen protectors for Blackberry) that 3rd party vendors can really sell whatever type they choose under this listing.  I partially blame Amazon for this; they really should have more specific listing categories so customers know what they are getting.Now, for the price, it's hard to complain, and it is indeed a screen protector, but it's unfortunate that you really don't know what you are going to get.",0,0,0,0

RBF1HH014A6C6,"TL;DR Don't buy unless you have the eyes of a hawk, the hands of a neurosurgeon and the patience of Job.I almost never write reviews but needed to here.  I was so excited to find a simple, low cost replacement toner cartridge for my HP printer.  The product description said I had to replace the chip from the HP cartridge to the new cartridge.  How hard could that be, I thought?  After all, I am a pretty handy guy. The package arrived with the tools necessary for the chip replacement.  Nice.  A piece of paper referred me to the chip replacement instructions.  Searching, I discovered that they were NOT enclosed.  Back to Amazon I went, and watched the nice video  (Watch it first if you think this is easy to do - my bad for not watching in advance!)  I opened the printer and saw the chips.  They are SMALL.  REALLY SMALL!  See the attached picture.  I tried to remove the chip per the video.  No luck.  I tried calling customer service.  No one answered.  I fiddled around some more and the chipset came loose!  I was on my way.  When I went to put it into the new cartridge, I discovered that I had to apply about 50 pounds of force to mount it properly, WITHOUT damaging the chip.  After 5-10 minutes, I succeeded.  I went to replace the cartridge, basking in my success, and, IT DID NOT FIT properly in the printer (yes, it was the right cartridge!) I tried calling customer service again.  Once again, no answer.  I jiggled the cartridge around to try and get it to fit - and the chip fell out - never to be found again.  Back to Amazon for a very convenient return.  5 stars to Amazon.  1 star for this product.",0,0,0,0
R2NBJTX17X6W4Y,"I should have read the reviews before I bought the book, because boy do i regret forking over $4.99. The book starts out good but things get ridiculous fast. Some of the actions the main character takes don't really seem like they would be in character for a true prepper, but I guess that could be debatable. The other characters in this book are a bit of a joke. You have the token giants that are strong of body but slow of mind, the beautiful woman that are somehow taken with these simple,  slow witted but stronger than a bull men, and  the token weak child that the main character takes in to protect. Oh and don't forget the various male characters doing things that are physically impossible, like one arming a person into the air by his throat, which, if even possible would probably require extensive strong man training and biceps as big around as my waist. Then there was Abigail. So, somehow i am led to believe there is a woman so beautiful that everyone stares at her and her family, and less than 24 hours after meeting the main character she sleeps with him even though she is married and then gives him some dirty pictures?  Unless I totally misread what was going on in the shower scene. Regardless that whole situation was just clumsily handled.

R3D7HZRF97FDM2,"As many others have said, this book is ""Star Wars"" set in a Tolkien world with a dash of Anne McCaffrey thrown in for good measure.  I don't fault the author.  I think it is remarkable that a 16 year old had the self-discipline to write a 500 page novel.  However, I can't understand why a publisher would have  printed it.If the book were simply derivative, I could have, perhaps, forgiven the publisher.  But the book is poorly written as well.  The style is awkward.  The punctuation is poor.  The characters are cardboard figures with the emotional depth of...well, a 16 year old.I don't buy into the excuse that ""Eragon"" was intended for young readers and not for a more critical adult audience.  If anything, standards should be higher for children's literature.  Every book is a learning experience for a child, and the children reading this book are going to learn that it is alright to place your commas is odd places.  They are going to learn that it is acceptable to ""borrow"" your story from other writers.  ""Charlotte's Web"" is a good children's book.  ""Eragon"" is a step below comic books as appropriate reading material for children.So...the author is young and inexperienced.  The publisher probably saw dollar signs when presented with an opportunity to sell a slightly repackaged version of Star Wars-Tolkien-MaCaffrey.  But where was the editor?  Surely, there must have been an editor who could have coached Paolini through some of the more obvious flaws in the book.In summary, the author should be congratulated for his industry.  The publisher should be sued.  The editor should be fired.",0,0,0,0

R1EZA5CLGYMRM2,"Am I the only person who thinks that this movie got all the positive reaction Star Wars episode I deserved, and Star Wars Episode I got all the criticism The Matrix deserved.Okay, it certainly isn't a bad movie, good  action sequences, interesting story, nice Gigeresque sets, but Keanu Reeves  makes Jake Lloyd look like an acting god, why did they choose him to play  the part of Neo. I really cannot think of anyone who could be less the  'Chosen One'.While the special effects are good, the reliance on a  'dark' look to the film, almost renders the technology of colour TV  functionless.  The costumes are boring, the bad guys look like my bank  manager at a rock concert, the soundtrack is cheesy, the slo-mo fight  scenes are comedic and as for the relationship between Neo and Trinity,  well there isn't one until towards the end of the film Trinity realises  that their complete lack of chemistry together actually means she is in  love with him.And as for the rotating cameras thingy, what's the point  it doesn't fit into the story at all, they just shove it in because they  can. The only brilliant scene is the big robot walking through a field of  human embryos.worst of all, however is the 'philosophical' question the  film poses. I'm getting a bit sick of films like this, Dark City was good  as was the Truman show, but Fight Club was silly and The Sixth Sense was  boring until the 'oh-so amazing twist'. Is it me or were these ideas  staples of dodgy late night 'chillers' such as tales From The Crypt and The  Twilight Zone.This question of whether we inhabit 'reality' or a  'simulation' of reality was dismissed by the Greek philosophers as  ontologically and epistemologically worthless, as anyone who actually  thinks about the film realises, it doesn't really matter, does it. It's  about as thought provoking as the question ""what would you do  if...(you won the lottery, had three wishes etc).I would have given this  film three stars if it was'nt for everyone going on about how 'mad' or  'deep' it was.The Wachowski Brothers should stick to action films and  leave philosophy to philosophers.

R3U0MXB80863O8,"I agree with other reviewers saying that this book is overlong, too stuffed with detail that does not move the story along and takes too long to get going. I LOVED Simmons's other book The Terror and am generally obsessed with accounts of Everest expeditions, so I thought complaints of too much mountaineering detail would not be a problem for me. It was. He takes his sweet time getting to Everest, and even once there I don't feel like the power or danger of the mountain is adequately portrayed. All of the spy hijinks he describes don't seem believable in the Death Zone and take a lot from the setting. So it lacks the life or death suspense of the Terror. The other issue is that I expected more of a horror novel, maybe one that incorporated superstitions around the mountain. It's maybe my fault for expecting, but I was disappointed when it was more of a caper. Even the most horrific part--the air burial--fell flat because totally unnecessary to the story.

R1PG97WBXYZOXI,"This story is based around a tragedy that occurred years in the past when Frankie's best friend, Sophie, disappeared in mysterious circumstances and was presumed drowned. Now running a successful hotel chain in London, Frankie is contacted out of the blue by Sophie's brother, Daniel, asking her to return to their home town to help him finally find the truth behind the mystery of Sophie disappearance. Apparently human remains have been discovered that are presumed to be those of Sophie and this has spurred Sophie's brother into action. Lots of little details about that fateful night don't add up and, since Frankie was there and was Sophie's best friend, Daniel hopes that she might be able to help him to shed some light upon what happened - investigate, talk to people etc.I am generally unable to stop reading a book partway through, no matter how hard going I'm finding it, as I feel invested after spending time reading some of it. However, I'm afraid to say that, with this book, I was tempted to stop reading after a few chapters and, although I ploughed on and finished it for the purposes of this review, it did not get any easier for me and I rather resented the time that I had to spend to get through it! I had two major problems with this book - the first being the remarkably unlikely chain of events and the second being the stilted character interactions. Right from the very start I found that I was having to suspend disbelief when Frankie agreed to return and ""investigate"" the circumstances surrounding Sophie's disappearance. Why would she do that?! Bits of explanation were thrown our way but, for me, it never really added up and I'm afraid that there was layer upon layer of events in this book that I just couldn't give credibility to. My other pet hate was the interaction and the dialogue between the characters which also didn't ring true and often seemed incredibly clichéd. I just couldn't get on with it.I realise that most people seem to have loved this book and I'm not sure why my opinion would differ so much from everyone else. However, given the number of 5 star reviews that there already were for this book I was really looking forward to it and was ultimately really disappointed. There is a twist in the tale at the end but I'd already guessed quite a portion of it and again, sadly, the explanation seemed rather far-fetched and unlikely.

R6E9Y8VWQF88E,"I've owned several Palm devices over the years, and have been a loyal customer. I was excited to buy the TX, as it has a lot of the features I look for in a handheld. When it works, it is great -- wifi, Bluetooth, great resolution, etc. It really has a lot of nice features -- the two stars I give it are for those features. Unfortunately, the sub par construction of the unit itself makes owning it more hassle than it's worth.Over the last year, the device has had to be replaced under warranty for a faulty screen twice, and it's starting to develop the same problem again. It was also replaced once for a faulty memory card slot (that was on a replacement I'd just received). Each time, the device was replaced and not repaired, so in all I've had four TX's, and each of them have had significant problems. I think that's a fair sampling of the device to know problems are persistent and significant.The faulty screen issue is well known and has been experienced by several owners (a quick tour of Palm's help forums bear this out). It becomes horribly uncalibrated and no amount of software calibration can fix it. Replacing the device with the same model does no good, because the problem will just happen again.Never have I been told by Palm why the screen issue occurs, and obviously they don't do anything but replace it with another unit which is pretty much destined to develop the same problem.I can literally see bubbles just under the outer plastic of the screen on my current unit, and parts of the bottom of the screen are faded, not to mention the battery on my recently replaced device is already draining far too quickly. I've only had this latest replacement for about four months.Now that my device is no longer under warranty and is once again faulty, I'll be switching another manufacturer.

R1Z7AYQQNB89IE,"I began reading this series this past July.  Come late August I had finished Eleven and needed a break.  Stephanie was becoming someone I didn't like or know anymore.  Maybe I had read them too quickly.  Anyhow, 2 months later I read Twelve Sharp.  Maybe I needed a longer break, but this book felt like one I had already read 5 times before.  There were several times where I thought maybe I had read it already, except small details like a name or place were different.  I felt like it had been a cut and paste and edit of previous books.I notice with many of the reviews, the 5 stars all love Ranger and the 3 stars or less are Morelli fans.  I am a cupcake girl.  But I could understand the author wanting to keep the romance from going stagnant by putting Ranger in as a catalyst.  However, Morelli should know what's going on.  And throughout the books he doesn't - at least it is not told to the reader that he does.  And to continue reading these books with Stephanie behaving almost as bad as her ex-husband Dickie and Morelli having no clue, I cannot continue. If tables were turned and Stephanie found out that Morelli flirted and kissed and had sexual relations with Terri, but acted like the loyal boyfriend, she would flip out.  I loved books 1-8ish.  But somehow Stephanie lost her moral compass and she seems to have morphed into someone different than I first met in One For The Money.During my time off from this series, I happily discovered Christina McMullen in Unzipped by Lois Greiman.  There are about 6 books in that series and it is fantastic and I highly receommend for anyone who has become disenchanted with Stephanie.",0,0,0,0

Doesn't matter where I bought it because it the product that I have a problem with.I will tell you why I personally can't recommend this printer.1. If you are on a tight budget, look at a different printer.  Yes, the printer itself is cheap, but that is the ruse.2. This printer has constant print problems where you have to clean and realign the print heads so much it eats up all your ink.  By the time it is functioning again, you are out at least a quarter of your color ink.3. To purchase replacement ink $58.00.4. I only get 100-150 pages per set of cartridges (if I'm lucky)...

R16T10RKVLXCXH,"I enjoyed reading other works by Bill Bryson, and as someone who has had a chance to drive many parts of back-roads America on business, I had higher hopes for this book, and wanted to enjoy it.  But as noted by other reviewers, Bryson comes off in this work as a curmudgeon rather than a humorist.  His attitude comes off as that of a ""conservative's"" pejorative stereotypes of an elitist, stuck-up ""liberal"" far too good for the likes of Wal-Mart, Gatlinburg, tourist attractions, buses, motels, fast food, and the like.  What others may find rural wilderness, he calls ""bleak,"" ""depressing,"" and ""lonely.""  I have been to many of the locales Bryson visited, many at roughly the same time as his 1980s tour (Beaufort, Bloomsburg, Mackinaw City, etc.), and I came away with much different impressions of the same places he describes--most likely because I actually interacted with an area and its occupants as an equal, not passing through hastily as a ""foreigner"" even though I have a bit of an accent.  My cynical impression is that those who find Bryson's travelogue humorous to the point of laugh-out-loud share a similar disdain for ""flyover country"" and its occupants, whereas those who live, work with, and even enjoy ""America's heartland"" will find this book disconcerting or depressing at best and insulting or offensive at worst.  Worse, the feel of the book is that of someone setting off to tour the country just to write a book about it, not of someone taking a trip to see the country for its own sake.",0,0,0,0

The kind of gore they crave is pretty much limited to one scene.  And that scene provides the only real nudity too (except for a couple of flashes during the beach scenes), so that part of the audience--the kind that used to like these movies for its cheap thrills and titillations--will be put off that the only real exposed beauty is having her organs removed while she's revealed.

After using this for a couple of weeks I have found some serious issues with it.  The ""C"" clamp that holds the compass together gets looser the more you use it and this causes the compass to become unstable when it is opened more than half way.  I was able to tighten the ""C"" clamp for now but this will be an issue throughout the life of the item.  The little screws that hold the the lead and needle in place also come undone very easily.

Ever thought about instigating madness in the mind of your preferred packaging specialist?If so, this is the perfect product for you!To call this “tape” is so far below it’s true purpose. This is not tape. This... is a mildly sticky, highly fragile, variable thickness, transparent, colored polymer on a roll.Strong? No.Easy to use? No.Capable as an unsolvable puzzle? Yeah, maybe.It all starts when your victim attempts to find the start of the roll... its so thin and imperceptible at an edge, that they will swear there is no edge at all. I literally used a razor blade to try and locate the end... sliding around and around in either direction to no avail. Eventually I used a quality packing tape, to tape over where a I thought an edge may be and pulled up the new roll’s edge. Beautiful insanity!This is where it really gets good... your victim now things they have a start. Home free... Not so fast track star! As soon as they begin to pull the piece they need... Pop, rip, tear, desentigrate! Spectacular!With their spirit crushed, they set their mind to understanding the complexities of defeat. Tweezers, knives, watercolor paintbrushes and even lavender oil are brought to solve the mystery. The only clue to this evil’s diabolical nature however is the first usable size piece to come from the roll shows a preposterous hole in the middle with the oddly teardrop shaped hole.This is where it ends. The marbles are lost. The cheese is slid completely off the cracker. All that is left is to decide where they will begin to dig their grave.Oh, in case you’re wondering if its just a one roll fluke...

R3N9HMQMH4FMY,"Recently my local bookstore teased me with some new adventure novels coming out.  I've loved adventure stories ever since ""Into thin Air"" by Jon Krakauer so I jumped on Amazon and ordered one of them, ""Holding Fast"" by Karen James.  The reason I picked Holding Fast is because Mt. Hood is pretty local and although I've never climbed it, I have gone skiing there.Well the book was the wrong choice because it is no more an adventure book then say Winnie the Pooh. It advertises itself as a adventure book through the extended title ""Holding Fast, The Untold Story of the Mount Hood Tragedy,"" but it's really about the author. If you are curious as to what really happened to these climbers you aren't going to find any answers from Karen James.What will you find? A lot about her, her feelings, her love of God, her inability to swear even in a book, the love her stepchildren have for her, the love her now deceased husband Kelly had for her, how much people love her art, etc.,etc., etc. The title of the book should be ""Holding Fast, The Untold Story of Me and How I Handled a Tragedy with the Help of God."" Now that would be a truly descriptive title.This book shouldn't be anywhere near the adventure shelf in the book store but placed firmly in the religious department. I should have read the back cover reviews before purchasing it from Amazon. If you have reviews written by such literary luminaries such as Troy Aikman, Roger Staubach, Sheriff Wampler, and wife of country singer Alan Jackson then as a reader you need to ""take the hint!""I recommend that you stay as far away from this book as you can.",0,0,0,0

R1A8B5HALR35XJ,"Update to my previous 5 star review.  When I ordered the HP 92/93 cartridges I ordered two sets.  The first set worked fine and lasted a long time.  The second set which I just put in worked fine at first and then ink faded out after only about 10 pages of printing.  I put my printer thru the cartridge cleaning cycle and the amount of ink got even worse.  Useless cartridges.  Sadly it is obviously hit or miss with these and I will never be buying again.______________________________________________________________________________________________________________Previous review  - Both HP 92 and 93 cartridges work greatIt's been over 10 years since I have given remanufactured ink cartridges a shot.  They were always leaking and worked streaky at best.  So I've been buying the HP 92 and 93 dual pack to be sure they would work.  But the cartridges are very pricey and when I saw the price and reviews of the Valuetoner cartridges I decided to give them a shot.  If they didn't work out - nothing really lost due to the price.  I was totally impressed with the purchase right upon receiving them.  The cartridges are packaged individually and with great care.  They also come with detailed and clear details on the cartridges themselves, how they work and how to troubleshoot if your printer won't see them as valid cartridges.  It all went very simply for me.  My printer noted that they weren't authentic HP cartridges but accepted them right away and printed the test page the same as after every cartridge installation.  These cartridges did not leak at all upon opening and printed flawlessly upon installation.  The test page was perfect and after about 100 pages both cartridges have not streaked or faltered in quality at all.  I see some people feel some cartridges are not performing as they wish.  Honestly that has happened with authentic HP cartridges to me many times as well.  I print many photos and often with the HP cartridges they would start fading or streaking after only 10 prints and I would have to put my printer through the clean cartridges mode.  With these Valuetoner cartridges that has yet to happen.  I am more than thrilled and impressed with their quality and the professional packaging of the company.  I highly recommend giving this company and these cartridges a shot.  If my cartridges do indeed start to falter I will adjust this review accordingly to be as accurate and helpful as possible.",0,0,0,0

But, I pay my taxes and donate to people in need, I go to therapy, and am even a preschool teacher: I am a good person and I don't deserve to be treated like this by a spool of filament. I print mostly in PETG from various brands and generally don't have issues that I can't fix. But this roll of black PETG was definitely wet out of the box, in addition to possibly having other issues I can't quite pinpoint yet. I tried vacuum sealing it with my own desiccant and leaving it for days, drying it in the convection oven at 350f (this did stop the bubbling out of the nozzle), tried every combination of settings and temps recommended by Hatchbox and by reviewers, I've meticulously calibrated z- and e- steps, I've started praying to it - but nothing convinces this filament to do anything except wrap around my nozzle and drag around the build plate. It's now sitting in a vaccuum sealed bag again. Maybe I'll try again after I've  finished recovering from this. I'll be happy to update my review if another color behaves better, or when and if the powers-that-be force compliance out of this particular spool of Black PETG.",0,0,0,0
R2RS723GBPHEZN,"I work from home and spend probably 60 hours a week in my office M-F.  After hours and on weekends, my hubby and kids use the office for gaming or surfing the internet so I needed a heavy duty chair that would be in constant use.  I decided to try a big and tall chair thinking it would last longer than a standard chair.I was wrong.I've had this chair for one month and the gas lift has already started to fail (from getting up and down constantly maybe?), and the casters are really cheap plastic and break easily.  For a chair that's rated for big and tall, I was surprised the casters are so cheaply made.  The seat of the chair doesn't fit into the bottom snugly so it wiggles around a little -- not so much that it feels unstable, but enough that it's annoying.For my taller hubby, the seat depth is fine, but I'm shorter and it's uncomfortable for me.  I can't sit far back enough to support my back so by the end of the day, my back aches.  If you're going to use it for just a couple of hours a day, I think it's fine.  For long-term use, it's just not a comfortable, well-built chair.  I'm sending this back for a replacement.",0,0,0,0
R2G7F5GH61BBEI,"We've been using Dymo label printers in our business for several years to print address labels. However, their software just would not work on a new Windows Terminal Server which all our users assess through thin clients. This Brother network printer seemed like it would do the job.The printer itself worked fine and the software did install on the Terminal Server. But, the software was a big disappointment (C- to D+ rating). Entering addresses was so much poorer compared to the Dymo that our users didn't like it at all.On the other hand, the Dymo application is an A+ rating. It even has a built-in address checker. With one click it runs the address through a UPSP database to verify the address, automatically make changes,  and generate a PostNet bar code. For instance, you can just type in the street address and a 5 digit zip code. The address checker automatically fills in the city, state and 9 digit zip code. Our users love it.So, back to the drawing board. Checking Dymo's web site and talking to their customer service confirmed that their software was not designed to work on Terminal Server. But, I kept at it. I finally got the software to work on TS and now our users are happy. (The Brother printer is back in its box on a shelf.)Tip on Dymo install on Terminal Server:Dymo software requires MS .Net Framework 3.51.Physiclly connect Dyno printer to server when installing software to also install driver.After software and driver installation, you can move printers to other locations.",0,0,0,0

RXYFE5DSY6U64,"This sequel is really closer to 2.5 stars, but of course that's depending on one's own point of view.  While the movie is visually stunning, there is ALOT (and I mean alot) of violence in the form of explosions, threats, death-defying suspense, etc.  There are also scenes featuring the cars drinking martinis and pub lagers and lots of low-brow potty humor. The plots concerning Mater feeling out of the loop and about ""big oil"" can be very confusing to little children - obviously, this is meant to appeal to older kids and adults. I really don't understand how Disney/Pixar got away with a G rating when the content in this movie is obviously more for a PG film.  Other Pixar movies such as 'Up' (not to mention the Dreamworks animated films) have made great profits with PG ratings... what made Cars 2 exempt?In regard to the dvd itself, there are very few frills included - you have to upgrade to the blu-ray and 3D blu-ray to get the majority of the extra features.

I read about 130 pages...but it took me almost four weeks to do so.  I spent most of my time finding other things to do other than read this book.The premise is interesting, glass dragons as a source of magic and also the basis of national security.

He finds a mysterious object, then later comes home one day to find his uncle dead.  The house (and uncle) go up in flames, and the farm boy goes off with a secretive experienced old mentor.  The mentor teaches him how to use a glowing sword.  The farm boy also learns about the evil leader and those who fight against him.

The acting is dry, and at times seriously over-acted, and I don't even know how over-acted and dry can possibly happen at the same time. But this movie perfectly captured that essence. Think william Shatner... mixed with Kirsten Stewart. That is how all the acting is in this movie, maybe aside for Patrick Stewart. He was probably the only good part of the movie, but even he can't redeem this massive boring s**tshow.I seriously wish I could take back those (probably close to) 100+ hours of my life wasted on this atrocity... but I guess the best I can do is hope to save other people's lives from being ruined.In short... read the bible.

R3MIJR3YJ5RACO,"This fascinating book is about the Chabad-Lubavitch movement and its late Rebbe, Menachem Mendel Schneerson (1902-94).This work is a well written account containing much interesting information.  The writer has clearly put a lot of work into this book and traveled widely to visit the various Chabad houses dotted all over the USA.I must admit, however, that I did find it a bit overburdened at times with narrative causing each chapter to be unnecessarily lengthy - but this may be just a male response!  The disturbing thing about the book is that the writer was clearly overawed by the Rebbe's shlichim [emissaries] - and one can even see why.  But this has resulted in an insufficiently critical perspective.  For example, shlichim are very persuasive in their assurances that they are not out to hijack Judaism, yet a Google search for Orthodox synagogues brings up, among other things, the Chabad-Lubavitch website which siphons people off to various Chabad houses and does not give an overall listing of Orthodox synagogues.Furthermore, the book barely touches on the theological aberrations of this movement (e.g.: God-in-everything [which is a distortion of the authentic Biblical teaching that God is everywhere or `omnipresent'] and reincarnation).  Of course, it can be argued that such an analysis was not the author's intention.  Nevertheless, as this is a book for lay-people, this would have been helpful.There is somewhat more emphasis on the bizarre practices involved in trying to keep in touch with the Rebbe after his death.  The question of whether some of this constitutes praying to the Rebbe is raised [pp.228, 277-278, 284], although the writer shies away from discussing any possibility that spiritism is involved in contacting spirits of departed people (contra Deuteronomy 18:9-14, for example).  However, an entire chapter is at least devoted to the key controversy in Jewish circles: namely the Rebbe's alleged Messiahship.From an interfaith perspective, I found two especially interesting issues.  The first is that the movement comes across as a kind of counterfeit of the New Covenant Faith as introduced by Jesus of Nazareth, who is arguably, and despite detractors, the best Jew who ever walked on this Earth.The second is the messianic element in this movement.  The chief opponent of this in Orthodox circles is Rabbi David Berger of the Rabbinical Council of America, who has attempted to persuade the Orthodox community that it must act vigorously to delegitimate what he has described as ""the false messianism and avodah zarah prevalent in the Lubavitch movement."" [The Rabbinical Council of America]Rabbi Berger has expressed his grief over this trend in these words: ""Despite a 1996 RCA resolution that was a source of deep gratification, these efforts have not met with much success, so that I live with the unspeakably distressing consciousness that after devoting much of my career to the study of the Jewish-Christian debate, I have seen the Orthodox rabbinate of my generation destroy defining elements of the religion they are charged to protect and obliterate the fundamental theological distinctions between Judaism and Christianity that our ancestors gave their lives to preserve."" [Ibid.]  But this merely raises the question as to whether the boundaries of Judaism are really as tight as Rabbi Berger would like.Clearly Lubavitcher messianism undermines a major plank in Rabbi Berger's thinking and raises the question of whether post-Yavneh rabbis have been on the wrong tack in rejecting Jesus of Nazareth as the true Messiah.  It is interesting to compare Rabbi Berger's remark with a comment by the late Gershom Scholem in the introduction to his book on Sabbatai Zevi (1626-76), an earlier false Messiah who converted to Islam under threat.  With characteristic perceptivity, Scholem wrote:There is no way of telling a priori what beliefs are possible or impossible within the framework of Judaism. ... .  The ""Jewishness"" in the religiosity of any particular period is not measured by dogmatic criteria that are unrelated to historical circumstances, but solely by what sincere Jews do, in fact, believe, or at least consider, to be legitimate possibilities. [Sabbatai Sevi: The mystical Messiah (1975), p.xi]So, then, rejection of Jesus' Messiahship is in the end not an issue of truth, but rather of current Jewish consensus.  Leading Orthodox Rabbi Dr Norman Lamm, quoted by Fishkoff, evidently finds this aspect of the Chabad-Lubavitch worrying as it undermines the currently-accepted paradigm:""If they believe the Rebbe could have been Moshiach, fine, I agree.  Many people could have been the Moshiach, and he had a far better chance than most.  But to say he's the Moshiach after he died?  The whole polemic we've had with Christianity for two thousand years is that we say a Moshiach who did not accomplish world peace, who did not accomplish the redemption of Israel and the world, is not Moshiach.  And here we're told that [the Rebbe] can be.  If that's the case, why were we so reluctant to accept Jesus?"" [p.268].Indeed, why?  How could we have missed him when the Scriptures are so plain?  This is probably the greatest tragedy in the history of mankind and explains so much of what is going in the world today.  Think how different the course of human history would have been if Jesus of Nazareth had been universally embraced from the start as Word of God, Messiah, and King of Creation.Rating this book is something of a dilemma.

R1I1X2VKM6HNFY,"Purchased the used model of this phone described very good. Unfortunately that was a total lie! The phone arrived with serious chips on all sides of the phone and corners meaning this phone was dropped many times in its past life. And the phone isn't even compatible with Boost Mobile while under the comments page it said it was.. To make matters worse, the phone upon arrival came with a totally dead battery and a charger cord and wall plug that dont work. After buying a new battery and charger I will be out an additional $30 or more making this a very expensive used phone which is still damaged on all sides. Making this phone a very bad deal. Whoever gave this phone a rating of very good, you suck! And you can have this POS back! Im returning it and buying a new one through a more trustworthy seller.",0,0,0,0
RDGXVN6VU4ZFD,"Of course, it grabbed me from the beginning with all the mass shootings we hear about now a days.  But, the further into the book I got the worse the language got.  I had read Nora Roberts years ago and didn't remember that she wrote like that.  Someone needs to give this lady a dictionary.  I could not believe such an accomplished writer could not portray anger and disgust in their characters without resorting to gutter language....sometimes a half dozen or so works on a single page, some of which I had never even heard before-just assumed they were dirty from the context.This story could have been told without all of that.  I did give it a two star rating because what I was able to read, having to skip over so much, was well written and the characters were believable.  Yes, it took a long time to eventually get the two main characters together, but that just gave the reader more time to get to know them as individuals before the romantic interest came into being.  Loved the character of CiCi and how the writer wove the other characters around her and finally used her to bring them all together physically.Sorry for such a negative review when everyone else seemed to love it so much but I expected better from Nora Roberts and a #1 Best Seller.",0,0,0,0

Lighter than previous hikers that I have worn.

Disappointing but still very comfortable.Second update: in addition to leaking, the sole on the right boot is coming off.

R1HG4EXHU6BXID,"Highly disappointed in this much anticipated movie.  My daughter has been enamoured with CARS since she was two years old.  She had a CARS themed party for her third birthday.  She had CARS shoes, clothing, toys.  It was only logical that her first trip to the movie theater should be for CARS2.  For a year we had been looking forward to this trip and the release of the movie.  Unfortunately, we were extremely disappointed.  This movie is very different from the first.  It is very violent - lot s of shooting - and the story line is too complex for the 3-6 year old crowd.  The story line is centered around a truck that used to own an oil company, he ran out of gas in the wilderness, sold his company and decided to produce a bio-fuel.  He had a world wide race with the cars only using this new fuel.  The the ""bad cars"" start to blow up the race cars with a lazer that makes the fuel explode.  *Spoiler alert* - turns out, the truck that produces the bio-fuel owns the larges underwater oil field in the world and is trying to convince everyone to give up looking for a suitable bio-fuel and switch back to gas.  What?  How is a four year old supposed to understand this?  I have NO IDEA how it got a G rating, as How To Train Your Dragon is less violent than this movie, in my opinion, and that is PG.  After the first ten minutes, my daughter was in my lap crying that she wanted to go home!!!",0,0,0,0

R8NPUMO9INF1Z,"Only actually used this printer, purchased in June/July, very little so far (late November) due to frustrating set-up problems with my tablet. Finally got totally fed up and went the desktop pc connection route - took me maybe 5 minutes to do that! It seems to work really well, a few seconds delay before starting to print but then spits out a page fast. Not as dark as I want and haven't found the setting in the clunky menu to make it darker. Also the page comes out with a noticeable curl from feeding through the printing process. For usage I might be inclined to give it 4 stars (menu has too much room for improvement, page curl) but the frustration with not being successful connecting it to my tablet, which I use far more than my desktop pc now, far outweighs how well it works. When trying to print from my tablet, the app on my tablet says connected, I click to print a doc, the printer screen lights up and says Printing... but nothing happens and the printer goes back to sleep. I did not try any form of customer service for help, after reading other reviews about non-English speaking customer service - thought that might add to my frustration level rather than help it. I'd like to see the company hire a true US-English speaking employee to put the instructions into real usable English - they are clearly written by somebody who knows enough of the language to string a bunch of words together, but not enough to actually explain the steps necessary. Or else the instructions are just plain faulty and need to be updated, which is also a possibility. Summary, when it's working I actually love? it!, but the high frustration and lack of success using it with my tablet far outweighs even the functioning, when forced to turn on my pc if I want to print something.",0,0,0,0

RPHCD90CRJ5AX,"I'm shocked by the largely positive reviews of this printer.I'm not a big review-writer but was compelled to create an account just to warn people against this printer, which is really, really bad.I'm on my 3rd printer. I've also had the print head replaced twice. I've tried everything I could to get a refund direct from Lexmark, but their strict policy only allows for continued ""repairs"" until the problem is fixed. In that sense (and in fairness to the Lexmark brand) they're very responsive and try hard to make it right (hence the repeated replacements.) But the problem, it turns out, is that the printers aren't broken. They're just poorly created.The problems:* Routine paper jams* Frequent ink leaks - several times, when printing photos, the paper has come out completely saturated with one color of ink or another.* CONSTANT color issues: when printing photos, colored text, etc., it invariably comes out with discolorations (blue = green, black = gray, etc.)* The touchscreen freezes about 3/4 of the time i use it, requiring a reboot to continue use* The scanning quality seems lower than advertised - always comes through a fuzzy* The print quality - when it DOES print correctly (rare) - is still very low. Not sharp, not vibrant.I'm somewhat computer savvy and have tried EVERYTHING recommended on the site to remedy my problems - updated drivers, firmware, etc. No luck.FYI: I'm using it wirelessly with my new MacBook Pro, so my only thought is some sort of operating system incompatibility, which might explain others' satisfaction with this printer.For me, though, it was a big mistake. And even though I'm on my 3rd, shiny new one, I'm going to buy a different brand of printer, because it's essentially useless.Stay away!

RLQK26YMBRJCW,"The director's Russian vampire flicks are interesting, if uneven, B fare. Wanted takes those B movie sensibilities to new levels of stupidity (and there are plenty of spoilers in this review). The whole curving the bullet trick I could go with but the idea that the guy's son was the only one capable of doing this job was beyond lame. The training was laughable as if in a few days (could've been weeks but who knows the time frame with this movie) he was able to master this. The butcher knife fight scenes were far too brutal really for the subtext of the flick which was about skill with a gun.The cast is terrific as you have Morgan Freeman as some sort of all-knowing Obi Won, Angelina Jolie as an assassin (does she have some sort of mortal lock on assassin roles?) who doesn't have to hide her real tattoos (hey, all that aside but eat a burger once in a while because although your beestung lips are nice, you are looking coat-rackish at times in this) as well as the ubiquitous Terence Stamp. The problem is the script is laughable despite some classic lines.Wait till you get to the dolphins with frickin' lasers...I mean mice with IEDs strapped to their bodies. Willard? Are you there Willard? I'm not making this up. There are actual suicide bomber mice in this.This movie jumps the shark several times that your jaw just drops how dumb it is. Given that the opening and closing scenes are thrill rides.

R393NFJOYRJWCK,"I write this review so YOU delicate shopper like me, don't suffer the despair and cringe like i did (and i still do). I bought this product because of certain needs that i had in terms of sound (knowing that Sony IS one of the icons in the sound industry), and i read some reviews (even the bad ones) that stated that it sounds like a box... i'm an audiophile and i do have some certain standards (i do have a dozen of Sony in and over ear products, all of them FLAWLESS), at first it sounded INDEED like a box but retouching the equalizer it eased and slightly improved the sound (which by the way it took me like weeks to fine-tune the EQ, it was really hard, even for me that i'm a sound engineer because sometimes sounded like i wanted to and sometimes not, i believe it had it's own will!).But now OVER A YEAR LATER, it started to sound ""MORE BOXIE"" than ever! i had to refine the EQ again and for every movie or series (even music) started to sound hollow, without bass (i had to turn it down because i already starting to feel the saturation, even en in normal volume because i use it to mood the room and watch the news), without the richness of bass, middle-bass and middle-high, which what you always look for when you buy a soundbar like this. Yes, i'm fully aware that ""i can't ask too much for that amount of cash"", but, it's money and the money costs by itself (to earn it, to save it and to manage it).Yes it is a space-saver, but another issue is the remote (you can also use an LG G3 or G4, didn't test with samsung phones), if you are pointing somewhere else that isn't a straight line (or a straight view from the remote to the soundbar) you won't be able to control it. The remote is too underpowered to send commands like a regular tv (no line of view needed), ALSO if you are like me that have everything in black (furniture, tv stands, other remotes, etc.) you'll easily loose it (that's where my phone comes in and it's a life saver!).I truly apologize for the mess in the review but i'm speaking with my mind right now and i'm going to focus again on the sound, WOW SONY, YOU SERIOUSLY MADE A MISTAKE HERE!... IT IS: sturdy, well constructed, and made-to-last, also 110/220v for those who live in other countries and it does include a toslink (fiber optic) audio and an rca standard, but... it isn't enough, the fact that it may include everything you need to plugin your favorite gadget/appliance IT DOES NOT WORTH THE MONEY.... and i regret the purchase with the bottom of my heart, i'm stuck with it, no one wants it (yeah, i tried to sell it but once they heard how it sounds they said ""no thank you"").If you, dear reader are looking for a soundbar that it does not sound like box LOOK ELSEWHERE and avoid at all cost this one! AND IF YOU READER WHO ALREADY OWNS OR TESTED more soundbars, please let me know which one does not sound like a box (not with separate subwoofer).Thank you very much for your time!",0,0,0,0

R3IHOVTJM20O0G,"Jonathan's book is built on an excellent premise: become fully human in all the ways Jesus was. Unfortunately, the structure of the book built on that premise is rather shaky.Jonathan starts his book by saying he wants us to know who we really are by coming awake to God and understanding that Jesus is our prototype. Jesus never forgot who He was – beloved by God. “He lived every moment of His life fully convinced of His identity.” (18) What if that were possible for each of us?The book was off to a good start, but then Jonathan lost me. By about a third of the way into the book I was tired of stories about Jonathan. I do think there is more about Jonathan in this book than there is Jesus. For example, he spends more words writing about his own attempts at going to the wilderness than he does of Jesus being in the wilderness. (Compare p. 57-61 with p. 51-53.) At the end of the book I knew far more about Jonathan (his wedgies at Bible camps, his riding his bicycle, Pentecostal upbringing, etc.) and others involved in his ministry than I did about Jesus.Sometimes I just didn't get him. “I think most of what you need to know about how life with God works is probably wrapped up in the bittersweet taste of dreams. All the longing and aching for something beautiful that is just out of reach. Sometimes you can touch it and sometimes you can't.” (118-119) What? That's most of what I need to know how life with God works? Poetic words, sure, but give me what the Bible says about life with God!I am yet still puzzled by how Jesus is our prototype and what we do with that. Jonathan has provided us with lots of stories but with no teaching as to how we really live into the identity of Jesus as our prototype. There is nothing about having the mind of Christ, or what it means to be “in Christ” or to have “Christ in you.”  There is nothing about the Spirit at work in you.I can tell Jonathan loves to talk and write. He is a good communicator. His book reads well and is poetic at times. It is just that he did not do in this book what he said he was going to do at the beginning.If you enjoy an individual's spiritually “coming of age” story and the stories of authentic followers of Jesus, you'll like this book. If you really want to know what it means to have Jesus as a prototype of being fully human and how to live into that identity, you'll have to go elsewhere.I received a complimentary copy of this book from the publisher for the purpose of this review.",0,0,0,0

R2SENHBN7IGRUI,"My first original order on September 3 arrived promptly & was exactly what I wanted. I loved them so much I ordered two more sets! Those pens were not at all what I ordered! There were 5 gel pens in the second package, and included several different colored inks! I tried to order them one more time, & again I got the wrong pens! My kiddos were happy to use them, so I did not return the pens. I want to order them one more time, but to say I am a bit gun shy would be an understatement, but someone at work “borrowed” both of them & they are now gone! The few hours I did get to use them I loved them! They wrote smoothly & my daughter & I are big Wonder Woman fans!

R3PIJEPFWVP7B4,Typical Star Wars story. The Han Solo character was nothing like the original Harrison Ford cast. The actor didn't look like Harrison Ford nor did he act in any way like Harrison Ford. The Han Solo character was unrecognizable by comparison to the Harrison Ford performances. Other than that it was just a typical Star Wars lots of special effects and repeating storyline.,0,0,0,0

R1PCKVL1VGTKR5,"I was so excited to receive this after reading the great reviews on this label maker.My needs for this are rather simple...too simple and yet the software that comes with this product is a nightmare.It is so confusing just to do something so easy! I spent almost 8 hours going through every command, option, setting, etc.How easy do you say?  For my job, all I need to print a name with a date on the bottom as large as it can be on a 1-1/7"" x 3-1/2"" label.I would like to have the name cleared out after each time I print a label, but leave the date on the bottom so I can easily copy and paste another name, keep the date and print, etc.  Sounds easy right? NO!  There is NO way to do this unless you highlight the previous name, then paste it in so it will delete it.  That becomes quite a pain when in the fast-paced environment I need this for.All I need is to constantly paste in a name within a label that keeps the date on the bottom and print, then have it cleared to paste in the next name while keeping that date on the bottom.I've tried templates.  Nope.I've tried going into the address book, which looked promising at first, but whoever programmed this has to be retarded.  You can change the font, bold, italic, etc, but you can change the size of the font!!  HA!!  How stupid is that?  So I can paste in the name, but now I can increase the font to fill in the label and you can't create a template in here that would fit the need of such simply simplicity!Tried to call customer service or chat, but not available and too long to wait.It's a shame but this whole unit is going back.  It's a shame since it's a nice looking unit and the labels do look nice when they print.  But the software is so confusing and stressful to use when you need for it to be flexible in a very simple way.",0,0,0,0

R376M7ZIF5OHK8,"I really, really wanted to like this desk: It looked great online, it fit our narrow space with a good amount of storage, the pieces were heavy, the hardware was well-labelled, and the drawers went together easily.But the main desk panels aren't drilled right, so the cam screws don't fit into the cam locks.  They were off by more than a centimeter on some pieces, which (as you know if you've put together as much flat-pack furniture as we have) is way too far to bend the screw to force it to fit and not quite far enough to drill new holes for the cam screw and cam lock.  Also, drilling those holes so they match is a giant pain and this desk just wasn't worth it.If you're lucky enough to get a desk where all of the holes are drilled right, I'm sure it's a handsome piece of furniture.

R3TD6RDQ03R8DG,"I realize that it is necessary sometimes to suspend believability when reading a book; but this one takes that beyond the extreme. First, there as a tom cat who can understand and speak human language, can even make telephone calls, and can read human writing. Next, we are introduced to a female cat with the same abilities. (This is not a spoiler; it is revealed in the first few pages.) But when we get to chapter 10, the unbelievability factor goes out of sight. I will not comment on this, because it would be a spoiler; and judging from the reviews, a lot of people are okay with it.

R7LMZQJ626ITX,"The premise of Perez-Reverte's books always sounds perfect for my taste, but the actual books always fail to live up to my expectations.A lot of what I found problematic has already been mentioned by other negative reviews: contrived faux intellectualism, poor character development, laughable motivation for the crime, a disappointing denouement...One of the reviewers raves about the language in the original: well, if it's that well-written in Spanish, it must have been poorly translated, because, for example, at some point, the writer used the word ""grotesque"" to describe a person 3 times in a row within the space of 2 pages.  In fact, that ties in with the poor character development: aside from Cesar and Julia, I never got a feel for any kind of affection or friendship between characters, even though Menchu was supposed to be Julia's best friend.The book opens with a mystery of a painting, with the main characters trying to figure out who killed the knight, and I honestly thought that this was going to be the main focus on the book.

R33DPOD728S87A,"I was disappointed with this (3rd?) book in the Orchard series by Sheila Connolly.  I had hoped for an improvement over book 2,but alas it was not to be!  I realize I am in the minority here.  First: too much about ""local and fresh food "" and the modern catchword:  ""SUSTAINABILITY.""  Enough already. Very preachy. And boring details about opening a restaurant. Btw- the ""baby chefs"" in this book were immature, ill-prepared, spoiled actually, and the female baby chef is lazy and annoying. Gee am I forgetting anything? I agree with the character ""Bree"" in her opinion of Nicky, who I am afraid Ms.Connolly wrote in her series to include in subsequent books. It makes me want to NOT buy the other books, truth be told. Annoying character.  Meg and Seth ramped up their ""Romance"" a notch or two, but I still don't feel any of the spark through the pages. The main thrust of the book series -the apple orchard - continues to be interesting to me but the author could trim back the details by a few pages overall and we would still get the drift.  Oh how could I forget to comment on ""The Mystery"" of this book?  Really: as others have noted; it was really a SUBplot. And one , it seemed,that Ms.Connolly realized she needed to wrap up - somehow - as she got to her pagecount end. So what does she do?  (SPOILER ALERT)** She grabs the most convenient scapegoat: the old and prim town councilperson/conservative/uptight old lady. You know: the one that no one REALLY ""likes"" because as the characters SO often mention in the book ""She doesn't really want any change"" and ""She has old ideas that are out -of-time""  Etc.  Goddess Forbid anyone in any of Ms.Connolly's b ooks should be portrayed POSTIVELY if any of the following apply  A)  Republican or conservative, B) Old  C)  Old fashioned morally D) traditionalist.  Oh and not socially liberal.  Ms. Connolly, do you concede that MAYBE just maybe, some more ""conservative"" people who like to read cozies are among those who spend money on your books?  I would be ONE of those people. Oh and although I am a dreaded, registered Republican, I am actually quite socially liberal and even WITH that ""label"", I found your intolerance (yes I said INtolerance) of those who appreciate more ahem- ""traditional "" ways - to be off-putting. Way to go Ms. Connolly: stick the prim old lady as your villian at the end (Suicide by pills?  What a cop-out!), wipe the town council of ANY sort of dreaded opposition to any and all ""new ideas"" , and tidily wrap up your so-called mystery. On second thought: I am changing my 3 stars to 2 stars.  And I think I will keep my money in my purse instead of buying any future Connolly books; although I concede that if I see the next Orchard mystery somewhere else like a secondhand bookstore or the library, I will take a look at it.",0,0,0,0
R2QFUYL7F8C0IS,"It was better than E7 or E8 but I just can't buy into Alden as Han Solo.  Disney's major mistake is destroying all the Stars Wars novels, expanded universe and lore that came before they bought the rights.  According to this movie, Han last name is a gift from an Imperial Recruiter, not.  I am prejudice best I have read all the pre- Disney Star Wars fiction and the rewrite's just don't make any sense.  Han originally saves Chewy because he abhors slavery and thus gets a life debt not to save his own life like in this movie.  If they would have made this just a science fiction film minus the robot sex, PC garbage and political stuff it would have been a good film.  When they add they Star Wars stuff it falls apart.  How does Darth Maul appear in this film?  He died before the Empire was even created.  Some of the Wookies remined me of the 70's Planet of the Ape's apes not Wookies at all.  I didn't think the acting was too bad but there wasn't any chemistry between Alden and Emilia.  I thought the backdrops of the planets were good except for Corellia, which was heavy covered in Star Wars fiction and nothing like they portrayed.  I think we keep expecting someone/anyone to recreate the look and feel of the originals (Disney has tried because E7 & E8 are just a retelling of the originals but with terrible casting and no new ideas and too much PC stuff) and I don't think it is possible.  I can think of 3 times that a cast was put together that sold a movie franchise:  original Star Wars, Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings.  I did think they did a good job on Rogue One (which is my favorite of the Disney Disasters) and Han Solo will now be #2 and I may watch it again if it comes on Netflix.  Last point, I have tried watching E7 & E8 again and can't make it very far because of all the problems and stealing from the originals but I think I could make it through Solo again but it is sad what Disney has done.",0,0,0,0

I listened to the audio version which I got from audible for a discounted price when I bought the e-book and thought my eyes were going to get stuck; I kept rolling them. I am so glad I didn't pick up the whole series at the same time as this was horrible!Characters: Myst is a HUGE whiner who Bastian admires for her bravery? She is continually acting like a spoiled child and is just annoying. Bastian is an insecure dragon leader whose inner dialogue is just stupid. Both of them act in slow motion and continually find themselves in situations they could have avoided if they had only moved instead of stopped to contemplate their feelings. It is so hard to finish this audio book! If I had been reading, I would have just started skimming!Writing Style: PROFANITY almost every other word; I mean OVER THE TOP, like a sailor. Between all the swearing and the cliché sayings, it was hard to find any original sentences. While the plot was good, the CONSTANT inner dialogue was TEDIOUS. All of chapter seven is Bastian's insecure thoughts and WHO REALLY CARES???? The only part remotely interesting was when actual dialogue was happening. So No, I do not like this author's writing style.

RUYHSUSKZA9R0,"St. Elmo's Fire is a coming-of-age movie that will have a certain nostalgic appeal to anyone who was a teenager or a 20-something in the mid-1980s. It will be of limited interest to anyone else, unless you are excessively interested in the pop culture of that era.The main characters of St. Elmo's Fire are seven recent college graduates who are beginning their professional lives. As other reviewers have noted, these people aren't credible as an ensemble of friends---nor are they particularly believable on their own merits. Somewhere in this mess is a story about the transition from adolescence to adulthood; but the inconsistent characters and disjointed plotlines distract the viewer from the larger themes.To cite just one example: Emilio Estevez's character, Kirby, develops a severe infatuation with an older woman. He acts out his obsession in ways that would disturb anyone, even threatening the woman's roommate at one point. But the woman who is the object of his desires seems to regard these antics as vaguely cute. People were not quite as sensitive about stalking and sexual harassment in the 1980s as they are today; but this behavior would have been over the top even then. No woman would have tolerated this, much less found it endearing.Demi Moore's character, Jules, is a compulsive liar who becomes addicted to cocaine. No adequate explanation is ever given for her behavior. Throughout the movie, she moves from one unexplained crisis to the next. Nor does the partial resolution of her conflicts at the end of the movie make any sense.I watched this DVD with high expectations. I was a teenager in 1985; and I remember that this movie was heavily hyped at the time. But after spending 108 minutes on St. Elmo's Fire, I could not help thinking that I might have gone another 22 years without this experience---- and been no worse off.",0,0,0,0
R1LZKK4QZUGN4T,"Since ""Blade"" came out in 1999, Marvel Comics caught a big one with the super-hero movies. A year later, Bryan Singer proved with ""X-Men"" that comic book adaptations could be both ambitious and succesful, then... a monster was born. ""Blade 2"", ""Spiderman"", ""X-Men 2"" and ""The Hulk"", all hit (and smashed) the box office, and many more are on the way. Of all these flicks, only ""Daredevil"" was a financial disapointment, and I have to say that 10 minutes into the movie you can see why.First of all, and I think most people agree on this, the main problem of ""Daredevil"" is its lead star. Ben Affleck is an actor that just doesn't seem to make it . He is very good as Matt Murdock, the pro-bono lawyer, and you even like the guy when he talks to his buddy in the Seinfeld-like coffee shop. However, once he puts on his superhero costume, the magic runs out. Affleck just doesn't have the dark sex appeal necessary for the nocturnal vigilante (anyone who has seen Tim Burton's Batman knows how important this is), therefore his character fails to deliver the necessary empathy or connection between the audience and the hero. You would think that with such a problem, the supporting cast should make up for the rest, but you're wrong. The movie has some beloved Marvel characters like Elektra (Jennifer Garner), Bullseye (Colin Farrell) and Kingpin (Michael Clarke Duncan), but none of them is crucial to the story. NONE OF THEM! I swear to God that if you add up all the scenes in which they are, none of them is on the movie for more than 20 minutes. Or at least, it doesn't seem so. Elektra, especially, was thought to be the best thing in the movie. At least, in the trailers it looked like she was. She sort of is, but she only has two (I repeat, TWO) fight scenes, and her character is pretty much wasted. So is Bullseye, who is little more than a cartoon in Colin Farrell's hands. As for Kingpin, well, I don't mind that they changed his looks dramatically, but he's the least developed character. A stupid plot twist makes him Daredevil's archenemy, and the end is just silly and pathetic.Another problem is the plot. Or better yet, the ""plots"". A lot of things happen in the movie, but none of them are central. There comes a time when Elektra is out to kill Daredevil, believing he's her father's murdeder. THAT should've been the movie, but it is resolved quickly and without consequences. Anyway, in plot, character and performances, ""Daredevil"" takes the plunge big time.The edition is another story. It is by far one the best I've seen. It would be easier to say what doesn't have. Of all the documentaries, featurettes and other features, some are dedicated to the comic book, others to the movie. Both are great. It seems like this time New Line Cinema really went for the money, which makes me think that they hope ""Daredevil"" to be a hit on DVD more than it was on the theaters. If you're a fan of the comic book, then these features should be more satisfying that the movie itself.There isn't much more. I really can't say that I liked ""Daredevil"", but I've seen worse. However, of all these superhero fever, I advice you to stick with ""The Hulk"" or ""X-Men 2"". This goes to show you that for a comic-book adaptation to be good, it's not all about big budgets and special effects. There's something more, and this one doesn't have it. I've heard that they are preparing new superhero movies, including a second ""Spiderman"", a third ""X-Men"", ""The Fantastic Four"", ""Elektra"" and ""Catwoman"". Somehow, I don't think that Ben and his blind lawyer from Hell's Kitchen are making a comeback.",0,0,0,0

R93B0V8766DLY,"As with other reviewers, the glue attaching the leg holders to the glass came unglued with very minimal handling.  I bought two which are side by side under my new big screen TV, and both came unglued.  I tried using the bonding glue that you use with a blue light, and even that didn't hold, probably because the light can't permeate through the black plastic.  It will be a hassle to disconnect and move my TV and components to try other glues.  Obviously Fitueyes is having the same trouble I did with finding a glue that will stick.  I actually ordered three, and received one clear glass monitor riser from Fitueyes.  It  has four nice stainless-steel-looking round legs at the corners, and works beautifully in my office.

R176FJDINFQ8JK,"I’m so upset. The first photo is my skin before using this horrible cleanser. The second is days after the worst breakout I’ve had in years.

I waited a few days to even take the second photo because every time I looked at my skin I wanted to cry. Years of trying to get my skin clear and this effing “cleanser” sent my skin back to 7th grade.

But since I was mostly using it for documents it was fine.Then you find out the color ink is terribly overpriced and runs out quickly.

R19ZVXQ3E0LNWU,"1.5/10 starsTen years ago, who would've guessed that emo would usurp punk as the genre du jour for angst-ridden teens. By the late 1990s, most fans of the genre's second wave were abandoning it. Many of the best bands had split up, while the handful that were left were moving toward a more straightforward pop rock sound. But just as it appeared over, the scene suddenly exploded, giving birth to an entire new generation of slick, generic, mall-store neo-emo. It's like the bartender yelled last call, the house lights came on, and then at the last minute, he decided to keep the club open all night serving Cokes. So now, 20 years after Rites of Spring's only full-length album was released, we've arrived at Panic! at the Disco's A Fever You Can't Sweat Out.Where does one begin to describe this steaming pile of garbage? You've already seen the ridiculous name, so let's try a few of song titles on for size. Track two is called ""The Only Difference Between Martyrdom and Suicide Is Press Coverage"", and it's followed by ""London Beckoned Songs About Money Written By Machines"". If those don't quite do it for you, check out ""I Write Sins Not Tragedies"", or my personal favorite, ""Lying Is the Most Fun a Girl Can Have Without Taking Her Clothes Off"".But of course, the asinine song titles and the moronic band name have nothing on the actual songs. The usual guitar, bass, and drums are augmented by drum machine beats and synths that would be more at home blaring over the P.A. at your local gym than in anything one might consider enjoyable music. The production, handled by Matt Squire, a guy who is certainly no stranger to radio-friendly emo, is slick and polished. Vocalist Brendon Urie's impassioned, warbling vocals are so strained it's as if he might just burst into tears at any moment. This poor guy's heart must get broken on a daily basis or something. And if it wasn't bad enough, someone convinced him to add some fancy effects on a track or two that make it sound like someone is lightly karate chopping him across the throat while he sings.The lyrics are just the sort of vague teen heartache you'd expect. In ""Camisado"", Urie croons, ""You're a regular decorated emergency/ The bruises and contusions will remind you what you did when you wake,"" sliding up to a falsetto while keyboards shimmer behind him. In ""Time to Dance"", which utilizes some sort of poorly realized gun-as-a-camera metaphor, he belts out, ""When I say shotgun, you say wedding/ Shotgun/ Wedding"", and ""Give me envy/ Give me malice/ Give me attention/ Give me a break."" Yeah, you and me both, kid.It's sad that this is what emo has become. The genre's always had some irritating characteristics, but this newest batch of heartbroken heartthrobs has managed to build their careers solely out of those characteristics. The whining, the emotionally exposed lyrics, and the passionate choruses are there, but there's no sincerity, creativity, or originality. [1.5/10 stars]-Cory D.

RHIFHGU894R7R,"I really disliked this book and the whole Legacy of the Force series.  This is the first book of the series.  The series seems bent on seeing how many former allies they can make into enemies and how messed up they can make both the Skywalker and Solo clans become.  There is nothing about this series that furthers the Star Wars universe in a positive way.  None of the characters are truly heroic including Luke who seems to have forgotton all hr learned from Ben, Yoda, and from lessons in his later years in bringing the Jedi order back into existence.  All of the Jedi seem very inconsistent and many of the main characters portayed too differently by the 3 authors in the series.  The ending to the series is quite ludricous.  This particular book fails to explain how a universe that finally had many allies by the end of a recent series can suddenly be turned apart again so quickly and by the Solo and Skywalker children.  It seems to be a very poor rehash of the prequel novels  Save your time and money and avoid the Legacy of the Force series!",0,0,0,0

RTW67S8PVSVBY,"This chair took a long time to put together and now I have to take it apart and return it.  The lower back support is just above the seat and the gap between the back and the seat is not as large as pictured.  When a person sits in it, the lower back support pushes against the person's bottom and not the lower back.  With the seat being made out of the same slippery mesh material as the back, for me this means that I feel like I am sitting too far forward in the chair and I feel like I am perpetually sliding forward off the seat.  There is no tilt up mechanism under the front of the seat to help with this.  This seat does have tilt backward, however, and has a tension adjustment on that tilt which is nice, and it also adjusts up and down but the material and the design make it impossible for me to use. The arms rests are low, but I expected this from other reviews. It also came with a dent on the top of one of the shiny silver chair legs. One other thing about the mesh material on the seat cover is that dirt can fall through the holes and sit there.  While waiting for customer support, my cat jumped on the seat and I noticed some kitty litter stuck under the material.  In theory, this seat would be nice if the back unit was higher up, if the seat material was less slippery and without holes, and if the front of the seat tilted back slightly or had an adjustment (though it would likely raise the price).  I understand that the chair is not expensive, but a cheap office supply store chair is more usable than this one for me.  Hopefully this review helps.",0,0,0,0

R1GXB3PE989IAO,"I had high expectations for this book but was sadly disappointed. The author makes numerous statements along the lines of, ""Lincoln tried repeatedly to do such and such,"" but provides no documentation to substantiate those assertions. There are very few in-line blocks of quoted text, and what footnotes exist, and the text as well, point mostly to others' work. There's simply an amazing lack of citations like ""on this specific date Lincoln said the following in a speech before whomever"", it's almost exclusively a list of unproved assertions.I'll include a specific cite, though. At location 457 (on a Kindle), the author states ""Right-wing economist Thomas Sowell ... believes the ancient habits and folkways of the South are still so influential that they control the behavior of entire regions of the north today. (Conservatives like Sowell used to champion individual responsibility and excoriate ""liberals"" who searched for ""root causes"" of deviant behavior. No longer, at least in Sowell's case.)""Anyone who draws that baffling conclusion from Dr Sowell's writing on race and economics is so obtuse and demonstrably in error that anything that follows is simply irrelevant.I want my money back.To top it off, the Kindle conversion is less than stellar: there are what appears originally to have been pull quotes that on the Kindle appear in the middle of existing text (between paragraphs), and there are typos.

I got a great price but much disappointment.(1)  The manual has poor clarity, often not enough to figure out key operations.  I'm pretty tech-savvy, so the problem does not lie with me.(2)  The machine broke in less than a year, so they sent me another.(3)  The mechanical design of the machine is not user-friendly, not intuitive.  To perform my basic operations, I had to call tech support, make notes, and later refer to them on matters that could have been better engineered.(4)  Tech support was always available (24-7 I recall), and wait times were moderate.  They always had an answer.(5)  It has worked well for two years since getting the new machine to archive my camcorder digital and old analog tapes to DVD.BOTTOM LINE:  I saved a few dollars buying this unit but paid for it many times over with the added time and monetary expense of dealing with its flaws.

R1Z41Q4S3WT1AC,"2.5/5I was looking forward to reading this as it sounded like The Passage by Justin Cronin, a vampire apocalypse novel I feel is one of the best vampire books in history. What I instead got was a sloppily written mess of a novel that takes forever to get anywhere, then gains some momentum in the middle, only to lose it at a lackluster ending.As most reviews point out, the writing is juvenile. A good editing would have done this book some good because, as it stands, it's like something that was posted to a writing forum. It's full of bad attempts at humor and this insistence in shoving the fact the author did his research down my throat. The eclipse portion of the book was painful.On top of that is a very slow beginning. I didn't feel any suspense or urgency to the first two hundred or so pages detailing the CDC's investigation of a blacked out plane on which everyone has died. It's slow and builds up to the big reveal of vampires that I knew was coming anyway so, in the end, doesn't matter in the least. All this buildup, the big reveal, then two hundred pages of jumping around to a bunch of side characters having to deal with the vampire breakout. Then two hundred pages of our main characters attempting to kill the lead vampire, the Master, and not getting anywhere. Making it feel like most of this book isn't even needed. There's so much filler to pad out the book it gets painful to read.On top of that, the much lauded action sequences are dull and poorly written and the vampires themselves (though with some cool ideas thrown in) aren't scary at all. The scariest part of the book is the cover, in which a worm is coming out of a lady's eyeball.This is a very average book. It's readable, I find myself preparing to crack open the second novel in this trilogy, but it's also below par for something as well reviewed as it is. It's not epic, it's not redefining. It's just kinda there.",0,0,0,0

R347246JIJ7DDE,"One should be sceptical of any book that requires a title and two sub-titles. Whether or not one is a member of the church founded by Joseph Smith, he is a singular and important person in the development of America and its organic life today. A book of apologetic encouragement to accept Joseph Smith's account of his life and experiences would be of little or no use to someone evaluating his assertions and the legitimacy of the impact of this extra-ordinary man. Equally unhelpful is a book, such as the amazingly perenial psycho-biography by Faun Browdy--whose deficiencies as a biographer were laid bare in her attempt on the life of Thomas Jefferson, about whom enough was generally known to enable an easy condemnation of it. A proper biography requires that an author take his or her subject seriously, and as the subject presents himself or herself to the world. Joseph Smith, unique among the founders of a religion in 19th Century America, presented himself as a prophet of God. He made clear and unqualified statements that he had, on more than one occasion, seen and conversed with Jesus Christ and an impressive list of angelic messengers; and who received revelations, now published, from them. He also produced a book (The Book of Mormon, best reviewed in Tyrrel Givens' ""By The Hand of Mormon"", Oxford Press) which he did not claim to have written either by himself or under inspiration. Instead, he asserted without qualification that the book was written by ancient prophets about real people, doing real things, at real places, in a distantly ancient world; and that his only contribution was to translate it by God-given instruments. Joseph Smith's presentation of himself is thus either that of a fraud, a prophet, or a pious or delusional fraud. Bushman's book errs in not discharging the fundamental obligation of a biographer to present his subject's importance based upon the subject's life work; adding historical and other contextual information to render the life in three dimensions. Bushman asserts apparently that he is a follower of, and believer in, Joseph Smith's declarations, suggesting an apologetic proselyting tool. The book is anything but that. Instead, Bushman compromises Joseph Smith as he compromises himself: a man who propounds what on the face of it may be implausable; but palatable enough to not be dismissed out of hand as a crook or a crank.This accounts for Bushman's need for two subtitles. The actual title, Joseph Smith, is of course what one would expect of a biography, although it is sparse. The first subtitle is not necessarily enlightening: ""Rough Stone Rolling"". That subtitle is either incomprehensible or misleading to potential readers of the book who do not know what it really means. Although not presented as a quotation, it actually is a phrase lifted from a longer statement attributed to Joseph Smith, which, if I have not got it exactly right, is along the lines of: ""I was a rough stone rolling, until the Lord took me in hand"".The full sense of the statement, and many others made by Joseph Smith, was the improbability of his assertion that he was a prophet of God, and a frank admission of his insight into his own foibles. The uninitiated will thus not easily understand that the title and first emendation mean: Joseph Smith, who although asserting he was a prophet, was insightful and candid in stating that the assertion was improbable in general, and as applied to him in particular. So far, one is only at the cover, and is at best unelightened and a worst confused about the pivitol issue in any written life of Joseph Smith.The larger problem with the book, and the clearest indication of its failure as a biography, is the second subtitle: ""A cultural biography of Mormonism's founder."" If that is what the book is, then it as irrelevant as ""A culural biography of Albert Einstein"", or ""A cultural biography of Beethoven"". The centrality of each of those lives, scientific genius, and compositional genius, would be displaced by an attempt to explain the work of either of them in cultural terms. Of course it is interesting to know that Einstein was Jewish, that he once worked in a patent office, and that he left Europe as a result of Nazi anti-semitism, but none of that contributes in any way to an exploration of the sources, genius, and impact of Einstein's work. One does not evaluate the brilliance of either of his theories of relativity by knowing of his ethnic background, that he was a victim of persecution, or his love life; because they do nothing at all to explain it and by trying to make them do so, his contribution to the world is trivialized. Those are the settings for the diamond; they do not assist us as we marvel at the brilliance to the stone that came from the mind of this mild and unassuming man. The culture in which Beethoven lived does through light on why he composed ""classical"" music (a tautology if ever there were one) instead of acid rock, or rap; but it does not help us grasp how this musical genious was able to produce works that will doubtless live and be loved forever. If someone's life is worth a biography, it should help us know what he or she did with his or her life that makes it important for us to know about it; the setting is the backdrop, not the explanation. There is an unbridgable gap between ""A Biography Of A Prophet"" and a ""Cultural Biography Of A Religion's Founder"". One need not like Beethoven's music to write a decent biography of him; nor accept that Joseph Smith was a prophet to write one of him. But one would accept that Beethoven claimed to compose music, and that it isn't explained by his culture; and one should accept that Joseph Smith said he was a prophet, and his culture did not drive him to it.And so to the point: Bushman tries to take a man who makes an assertion that he saw and conversed with Jesus Christ, and received revelation and authority from him, and explain how and why he did that in cultural terms. A proper title for Bushman's unfortunate book would be: ""Joseph Smith--If You Cut Him Some Slack, He's Not Such A Nut As You Might Think.""Bushman, in a remarkable display of self-revelation, wrote ""On The Road With Joseph Smith""; a sort of diary of his experiences in selling his book. That the little book should have been published at all reveals a great deal about Bushman's focus--Bushman--; but is also a promotional piece in which he hints that his book has been praised by high authorities in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. It is unvarnished name dropping; and appears among tales of Bushman's weekly checking on the number of copies of Rough Stone sold. The relevance of this to the book under review is obvious: the book is not about Joseph Smith (were it, the LDS book buying public would not need enticements); it is about ""the cultural Joseph Smith""; and there are no ""cultural prophets who actually converse with Jesus Christ"". That claim stands outside of culture; and transcends time and place. Bushman's book is mired in his own cultural miasma: an effor to accomodate the supernatural with the common place.",0,0,0,0
R2H9J3WTNOR5PT,"I used these stamps to mail packages to customers for a very small item. This was a big mistake. Not every sheet aligns correctly. Some sheets will show the postage amount while others will not. Despite this each stamp will have a bar code on it. So, you assume a printed bar code will be encoded with information right? Wrong. Over a period of 6 months I received about 10 packages back. Reason? Someone working at the post office didn't recognize this stamp. On some they wrote, ""?"" on the stamp. On others they stamped, ""No Postage"". These packages were retrieved from our P.O. Box. Keep in mind I'd been mailing these same envelopes with the same stamps for 6 months.I contacted Endicia. At first they stated it was something I did wrong. I reexplained the postage was printed and had been used several times from 6 months. There was no user error. I explained it was the postal service rep not being familiar with their product. They told me that I needed to complete a form, include the stamp with the envelope used and wait to get a decision on if I would get a refund. To do this it would cost about $5. The rep mentioned that there was no guarantee I would get a refund for this postage. He went further to state, ""you should just let it go."". I have a hard time ""letting it go"" especially when I've spent money and a company has profited. So, here I am leaving this review. It is cheaper to order stamps online from the USPS website, buy them from your mail carrier, buy them at an authorized stamp retailer or buy them directly from the postal service building.Did I mention if you misprint there is no refund? If your printer jams there is no recourse? If a postal worker doesn't know this product then it is sent back to you. Bottomline, you lose; you lose twice. The first time you lose is by purchasing this paper to print stamps on. The second time you lose is when you need a refund and can not get it. This is s product not all workers at the USPS are familiar with based on our experience. You can get a refund of ""real"" stamps. Just go to the post office and they will give your money back. It isn't worth it to buy this product. Stay away.*I uploaded 1 image of an envelope returned so you can see for yourself.",0,0,0,0

RDM0YNNEWQ240,"I like the intentionality that this type of planner can support, but there are too many mistakes and poor design desicisions to have this work for me ... so I’m heading to other alternatives on the market.This is not a yearly, weekly or monthly planner. It is only focused on looking ahead each day. There are sections for weeks and months but those are retrospective and not forward-looking.The weekly review has many very detailed questions that are phrased, oddly, in reference to “today” versus “this week.” It appears to be a quality-control oversight. Also, the detail level of those questions are indeed more appropriate for a daily review than a weekly review, so it looks like they’ve taken a daily review list from another iteration of the design and slapped it into the weekly review section.As other reviewers have said, there is a lot of real estate on each page dedicated to the daily schedule, while the other areas are quite cramped, and the daily schedule only goes up to early evening.The difference between “Today’s Top 3 Goals/Priorities” and “Tasks that Absolutely Must Be Done Today” is not clear. The author has a video where he addresses this and criticizes those who could be confused by this, going on to give a very vague and not really credible description of the difference.When I contacted the company’s customer service email about some of these issues, they were evasive and pointed me to a facebook group of “Brandon’s Students.”Finally, I’m not a big fan of self-proclaimed gurus who are marketing their stuff by saying “you too can be as productive as me.”Onward to Panda Planner Pro or another option.

R309SSK6404E2W,"When I first bought this printer and set it up, I thought it was amazing and completely worth it! But after about two months of using it, it's a complete piece of garbage. I probably thought it was awesome because it was a huge space saver on my desk and I loved the idea of printing wirelessly. If I could give this 0 stars, I would! Let me just jump right to point of why this printer sucks.1. Once it turns on, it takes forever to warm itself up. You have to wait minutes before the power light flashes than its ready to print.2. Every time you hit print, it always has to find the printer and connect to the printer which can sometimes take more than 2 minutes. And no, it's not my computer because I've had plenty other printers before that would just print off right away!3. If I'm printing 3+ pages, sometimes it'll print all 3 one after the other but most of the times, the printer just LOVES taking a break in between pages. One will print then it'll wait a minute before the 2nd prints and does it all over again. It's irritating!4. If you run out of paper during a print, there's no button you can press to tell it that's good to go after reloading and you just have to turn you printer off and back on. Sometimes doing that doesn't do anything at all! Even if I restarted my computer and the printer, the printer will keep saying that there's no paper, when there is paper in it!5. Majority of the times I can't print at all! Even with the USB cable plugged directly to my computer, it keeps saying the printer is not found. It's definitely not my computer because I've tried it on my brother and sisters as well.Every single time I absolutely needed something to be printed, this printer always failed me.Honestly, spend $40 more and go get yourself an HP1102 laser printer, you'll be a lot happier with that, it's much quieter and it prints way quicker than this piece of junk!",0,0,0,0

R20TEONMFVHL73,"I wanted to like this book. I read approximately half of the book before deciding to spend my time reading something else.Be sure it is clear to you, this is written by a journalist, not a scientist. For whatever reason I assumed this was written by an anthropologist, or biologist, it isn't.Williams argues puberty is occurring earlier and implies that this is probably due to toxic chemicals in the environment.  She is most likely wrong about this. Epedemiological data shows only a very small increase in average age of Menarche since 1950. Almost all of the decline in age of onset of puberty occurred from 1750-1950, before the widespread use of plastics.  Although breasts are developing earlier on average, this does not reflect an earlier onset of puberty. Most likely this can be accounted for by rising rates of childhood obesity.I didn't like the amount of space spent on the possible biological harm of plastics and industrial chemicals, a topic that is tangentially related to breasts at best.  The author tries her best to make the argument that plastics and other industrial chemicals are harmful, but in my opinion doesn't come anywhere close to making a convincing argument although she certainly tries! She seems to have interviewed everyone she could that believed plastics are harmful without ever seeking out a contrary opinion. While there is no clear scientific consensus here, more scientists than not probably believe that the threat of artificial chemicals is exaggerated, something you will not learn from reading this book.It became clear to me by her style of writing that the author does not have a solid understanding of chemistry. She doesn't appear to understand what free radicals are, or have knowledge of basic organic chemistry.  This is a serious problem if you are going to spend two or three chapters arguing about the harmfulness of man-made chemicals.I enjoyed the chapter on the history of breast implants, and to her credit the topic is handled in a balanced fairly objective manner. I usually found the humour funny but sometimes it fell flat.",0,0,0,0
R2AV7FR8D1RQCO,"******WARNING, SPOILERS AHEAD******I loved the first book (gave it a 5-star review) and couldn't wait for this follow up. I read it in a day and while I'm happy to have some questions answered after reading the epilogue to Everything We Keep, I'm a bit disappointed with the direction of things in Everything We Left Behind.While I'm aware this book is James's/ Carlos's story, I just feel there was way too little of Aimee. With everything going on in her journey - and so much emotion involved, I felt I didn't get enough closure from her perspective here. I was also hoping to see more of the family dynamics that led to the entire mess from EWK.Instead of all of that, the prominent figure in this book (along with James/ Carlos) was Natalya, who quite frankly annoyed me. I really had no interest in how much Carlos lusted after her, so soon after the loss of the wife he supposedly fell hard for, and yet, it was the main theme of the book. Natalya's hair, body and how badly he wanted to screw her and persuade James to feel the same way about her through the journaling. And somehow, she was just as much in love with the version of the man she only experienced for 24 hours as she was with the man she loved for 6+ years - even though they're two completely different people, even if they both had the same heart/ soul.It just wasn't what I was hoping for.The one good thing, though, was at least they took Phil's assault on Aimee a lot more seriously from EWK. It seemed this violation was shoved under the rug in the first book, so I'm at least happy the regrets and remorse happened here.I would have loved this book if:1 - There was more focus on healing the past and James/ Aimee having more interaction (I mean, that was what I was hoping for when I read the epilogue in EWK).2 - Far less Natalya (or none of her at all).I really wanted to love this as much as I did EWK. I'll still read the third one when it comes out and hope it ties up some loose ends between the two lost loves in a way that makes this journey worth it.",0,0,0,0

R1128TG2R3KLBM,"As primarily a jazz-pop musician I occasionally take a listen (albeit quite brief)to some of the top forty songs that are passing, at least commercially, for ""music"" these days. I took such a listen to this recent Britney Spears album. All I can say is the following:This girl quite obviously ""sings"" only via the aid of digital effects, electronic mixing, layers of tracking, and blaring backup music to obscure her actual lack of vocal acumen. Indeed, while listening I had to ask myself: ""Is there anyone singing on these records?"" All I heard was a high-pitched, nebulous whine interspersed with grunts and groans which combined made the entire cacaphony of noise sound somewhat like a bizarre cross between a large farm animal suffering from constipation and an infant crying for her baby bottle. No pitch, no key modulation, repetitive tempos, inane and often vulgar lyrics (when they were distinguishable, which wasn't too often), and no musicality whatsoever. Is this the nadir to which popular music has deteriorated? If so, it's a shame Tiny Tim has passed on....he would be able to make a grand comeback in today's pop music environment. He doubtless had a better voice than Britney Spears. But then, so do Alvin and the Chipmunks, Lurch, and Moe, Larry and Curly.Based upon what I have come to know of this Britteny Spears' character, I think it is safe to assume that come her next album Britney will appear on the cover totally nude and the disc inside the cover will be completely blank. Based on the apparent menial mentalities of her hordes of worshippers, they won't notice a thing has changed, and I'm just as sure the album will sell just as well as all of her previous musical masterpieces. Proof that in today's popular music industry a  ""popular singer"" no longer needs a voice to become a ""singing sensation,"" an idol of millions---all she needs is the attire of a French whore, the stage gyrations of a porn star in heat, and the backing of a multimillion dollar marketing machine. When I was a kid, I remember my parents thinking the Beatles were juvenile-acting, silly-looking, and musically amatuerish and mostly a product of mass media promotion. As years went by I began to see their point. Yet, compared with Britney Spears, John, Paul, George, and Ringo looked, played, and sounded like Igor Stravinsky, Arthur Fiedler, Leopold Stokowski, and Enrico Caruso.From Janet Jackson's simulating sexual acts and exposing her breasts on stage to Britney's lip-synching while strip-teasing on stage, the state of American pop music has become a showplace for coarseness, vulgarity, tastelessness, and, worst of all, a dearth of any sounds remmotely resembling genuine music. And to think millions of our children are growing up thinking that overexposed, oversexed, untalented cartoons are models of emulation. Young kids today who like music are already growing up with the notion to be---- not a pianist, guitarist, or drummer----- but rather the mindless, unmusical dote who operates the electronic instrument machines. Let's see, we have singers who don't sing, musicians who don't play musical instruments, and fashion plate pop perfomers who wear virtually no clothes. I think something is terribly wrong here, don't you?Ahh, the sweet music of the spheres....where art thou gone?I think I'll go back to my Ella Fitgerald, Mel Torme, Louis Armstrong, Benny Goodman, and Frank Sinatra albums. Maybe in another year or two I'll once again venture out into the fabricated world of pop music and take a listen at another Top Forty singer's vocal creations, but I doubt it.",0,0,0,0

The handle is WAY TOO THIN so the knife dangerously rotates as you are trying to shuck an oyster.  Perhaps it would be ok if your hands are Oompa Loompa in size.  I ended up having to go back to my poorly reviewed knife that came with my Zyliss Oyster Tool and Knife Set.  The HiCoup Oyster knife is beautiful but highly impractical.

It sounded right up my alley. Haunted old mansion? Paranormal investigator? Yes please! Unfortunately I couldn't get more than forty pages in. It was just really horribly written. Like a semi-decent fanfic you would find free online. The writing was sophomoric, the characters contrived and unconvincing. I was rolling my eyes every three sentences. I couldn't believe this author had so many published books. Then I read some of the reviews and a lot of them claim this is atypical of him. Apparently this was his last book before he passed away, so maybe he deserves a pass here?

RM0GV6A10YRA,"I am going to try to write the most helpful review of this product as I can.  DO NOT BUY, If you want to know what it feels like to be an owner of this 7.62 x 39 laser bore it can happen very easily.  Just take 15 dollars out of your wallet and put it in the garbage disposal afterwards take out another 10 dollars for replacement batteries and put that down the drain as well.  Finally, you will feel just like I felt when I got this, except I had to wait 10 agonizing days to get mine.The item came slowly, much like how the pilgrims came to America, apparently with the wind.  I put the batteries in and it worked perfect, for 4 minutes at which point it became so dim I could not see it on my bare hand 4 inches away.  A buddy had brought a gun over to sight in, and this quickly became impossible.  Bad batteries when shipped I thought, so out comes another 10 dollars for new batteries.  Again with batteries installed it worked perfect... for 5 minutes at which point it became so dim to be unusable again.After much messing around I have determined that if you put the first 2 batteries in correctly then flip around the last one and screw the cap halfway it will work for 10 minutes or so.  You are going to need some tape however to hold the laser in your gun.  Even the smallest pressure from the bolt just resting on this will make it turn off completly, even when it had batteries in right and lid on cap.  So now I use it with tape holding it in, because if you tilt the gun up at all it will just fall out of then gun.The most aggravation I have ever had, bad every way around.",0,0,0,0
R1DBXUV246J5XH,"It's really too bad that a DVD package this anticipated has so many flaws on display. For one, there are several instances where the audio sync to the picture is off a little, and in some cases off a lot (TOUGH WINTER). In this day and age there is really no excuse for this easily correctable problem.Visually, what were supposed to be nice new masters are also often quite disappointing. There is frequently heavy artifacting and posterization due to over-compressed looking masters. For several shorts the producers of this set chose to utilize inferior 16mm Blackhawk Films prints rather than go back 35mm prints and negatives, and in these cases the original titles are also missing.I happen to know better material exists on these films, and was utilized for the long out-of-print Cabin Fever VHS and DVDs ten years ago.  If you have the Cabin Fever disks, in spite of the age of their transfers you're probably gonna want to hang on to them, as some of these are a step down.Unfortunately, this is the most complete collection of OUR GANG stuff out there, and you may end up wanting it just to see these films again, but be warned if your a stickler for quality, it is a very mixed bag, and sadly a missed opportunity.11/11/08 - FURTHER viewing since I wrote this review has only yielded further dissappointment. Sadly I must note that there are almost constant issues of texture and detail getting swallowed up in pools of digital mush. I don't know if this is due to over-compression, or some overzealous filtering to remove grain and abrasion. Whatever the case, the result is frequent blurring and flattening of detail, textures, even facial features.",0,0,0,0

R3JOVSURJW1QCM,"I was really excited about this machine, but it leaked from the very first day. The hose attachment for the sink was missing, so we had to go to the hardware store to get a hose and connectors just to try the thing, only for it to leak on the floor. This machine doesn't drain fully on its own, even with the pump that the 17lb capacity machine has, so you have to put a pan or bucket low enough and tip it after use to try to get the rest of the water out of the hose and basin under the agitating tub (or take it outside to drain), the plumbing underneath this thing is glued together cheap plastic so there's no real way to repair it when it leaks, and the seller is third party from china, so if you have a problem, forget about a refund or sending it back - it's just not going to happen. So after going back and forth with the seller and Amazon for weeks, you'll just end up eating the wasted money like we did and then wonder what to do with this low quality machine and your deep disappointment. I know the reviews look mostly good on here (that's why I bought this thing!) but please!! Save yourself a lot of money, time, energy, and frustration and buy a notable brand like black and decker or something that you can send back stateside or get some actual help with, because if you get a faulty one of these, you'll have more problems than you started with.

R2E5QPRXNZRFWP,"I'm not quite sure what this film is trying to be. A comedy? A drama? A dramedy? Satire? I'm not sure at all what Diablo Cody was thinking when she scripted it. I am sure that the movie's just not as moving, funny, or entertaining as it thinks it is.The basic premise is that a 16 year old girl accidentally becomes pregnant and she keeps the pregnancy viable so that she can give the newborn to an adoptive couple. It sounds like such an interesting plotline to work with, but it goes wrong in so many ways.Juno is one of the least believable characters I've seen in any film. Everything she says smacks of forced weirdness which is really the problem with this movie. She shouts ""Thundercats are go!"" when going into labor. Would anyone do this in real life?! It's almost like the critics who raved about this movie were thinking ""Oooo, she mentioned Thundercats and the Stooges and Sonic Youth! I feel good that I actually understand those throwback low-to-high-brow references! Great movie!""Ellen Page rocked the house in ""Hard Candy"" but not in this movie. I'm a die-hard Arrested Development fan, but seriously, can't Michael Cera play any other role? Justin Bateman? Baseline creepy in this movie. Jennifer Garner? She's the only genuine character here and the only reason why I liked parts of it. Her portrayal of a woman desperately wanting to be a mother is almost heartbreaking.Juno reminds me of a few others movies I've seen over the past few years like Gosford Park. These are films that are borderline average but seem to get rave reviews because critics feel like they need to laud them for their supposed wit, heart, originality, etc. Unfortunately, Juno has not much of any of the above.",0,0,0,0

R3K3DRZLYQ6XKF,"I am getting discouraged in finding a quality laptop tray. This will be the second one that I am sending back. I read the reviews, and they were so mixed that I decided to give it a chance. I don't like that I would need to add my own adjustments to make it more functional e.g. adding something to the little side drawer so that it will stay closed until I want it open. If you were to tip the tray sideways even just a little for any reason, it will slide right out. Also, the little laptop bar that keeps the laptop from sliding off of the tray, is detachable, and a very weak piece of wood, so if you remove it a couple of times, I don't think it will hold up very well. In my opinion, it should have been glued in and made to be stationary for stability, whereas it wiggles when something is not propped against it and could probably be popped out with handling/storing. The tray came with a ding and scratch or two in the paint, but I think they occurred during the painting/staining process. It looks nice enough if you don't look too closely at it, and the propping portion was great and very functional. Overall though, for the price, I was worried that with the lack of quality (strong wood material) that if one of my 3 children were to knock into it accidentally, or if it fell for some reason, it just wouldn't hold up. $30 isn't expensive, but it's not inexpensive either, and I really need something with durability, but that looks nice and works in a functional way.

R2X1KG1H0UT3NB,"I was willing to give this a shot as a Star Wars offshoot, and I tried to be open-minded, but man this was awful. First, and biggest gripe, I felt like I was getting glaucoma while watching this. So much of the film is dark, shadowy, cloudy, smoky, hazy, foggy, and whatever other words you can use to describe OBSCURED visually. I mean, I get it, he has a shadowy past and all, but I think Ron took that a little too far with the direction. Watch this, and then watch one of the prequels, and it's like someone gave you some corrective lenses.Second gripe would be the characters. I didn't care for any of them, particularly the Han actor, who looked, sounded and acted NOTHING like Harrison Ford. If they had branded this as what it was, big-budget Disney fan fiction about some other guy in the SW universe then heck, that would have been a little bit better, but as it stands, none of these characters were memorable, and Woody Harrelson just always seems to be the character of ""Woody from 'Cheers' but he hasn't aged well."" There are plenty of the standard token characters, including Woody's space crew that felt a lot like a ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" rip-off (the little alien with 4 arms sounded a lot like Rocket, and his lady friend was Gamora, etc.  And that annoying L3 robot... what were they thinking? I was actually overjoyed when (spoiler) the thing was destroyed on the mining planet. Ok, I get the gripes about SJW issues being shoved into the film, and I understand that there is a message there, fine, but its far more convincing when that SJW-issue is established as the principle conflict of THE FILM, and not just some preachy afterthought for comic(?) relief (horray, free the robots! Duh...)  And the thought of Lando being intimate with a robot was more than cringe-worthy - it made the character seem like a creep, which was a shame as the Lando charatcer was initially one of the only interesting characters of this entire film.What else can I say? The film was a confusing mess. The special effects were ok, but the John Powell score was just flat (much like Michael Giacchino's functional film music, it colors the film itself fine, but was boring otherwise. I've listened to it isolated on Spotify and other than occasionally quoting some earlier John Williams' cues, which are fantastic, the rest is just a snooze.)I understand why this was a flop, and I'm thankful that I waited for RedBox... and not just that, I had a free rental coupon from Honey Nut Cheerios, so I didn't have to pay a cent for this turkey.",0,0,0,0

The opening between the body and the blade is huge and the envelope often goes into the corner missing the blade. When this happens, the paper just smushes.

But BEWARE this ink EXPIRES and is extremely expensive. There is no warning or indication that the included inks EXPIRE.Make no mistake. This printer makes amazing prints. But I am a low volume home user. The printer comes with a '3000' page supply of ink. We print maybe 500 pages / year. We have now owned this printer for about 2 years and have partially consumed about 3/4 of a block of each ink. However, the printer has recently started complaining that there is incompatible ink. I checked this out and was advised that it expired. I spent $600 and bought a set of new ink blocks. I removed the unused blocks (all 4 colors). These cannot be reinserted as is complains that they are expired. Looking at the blocks, there is a different pattern in the 'bumps' that seem to be labeled A thru D.Not to mention that I now have to dispose of my unused ink blocks (4 of them - about $200 worth). And not exactly environmentally friendly and no waste.I hope the new blocks do not 'expire'.If you print >3000 pages/year this is a great deal. For a low volume home user, this is expensive, especially if the regular bought ink also expires. But, if you want the absolutely best print quality you can get. Go for it.

Even worse is the obvious stereotyping of Japanese: the only Japanese character who seems to have any redeeming feature is a half-American woman who hates Japan as much as Crichton does.My advice is, if you value objectivity and good literature, give this book a pass and save your money - I wish I had.",0,0,0,0

R1UUFLE424C8XM,"I very much wanted to love The Strain. Not only because it would have been nice to have my first book review be 5 stars, but mainly because the premise seemed good. These were meant to be scary, horror inspiring vampires that kept you awake at night in fear as opposed to moody, love struck vamps that ""sparkled"" in the sunlight and played family baseball during thunderstorms (bleh).In actual fact the book started out quite well. The initial mystery surrounding flight 753 was compelling enough to get me hooked. But the novel quickly went downhill fast from there. Not only was there far to much padding, (I found myself skimming much of the second half), there were just too many errors of logic throughout.For example, vampirism is initially explaind as a virus which infects the hosts, rewriting their DNA and turning people into monsters who then spread the disease on to others. That's good, I can buy that. But then they start talking about blood worms. So is it a virus we are dealing with here or a parasite? And then they introduce crazy stuff without any apprent forethought. For example no vampire can cross running water unless aided by humans. Hugh? Why? And you can always tell a vampire because their reflections vibrate, but only in mirrors made with silver. What the ...? Are we still dealing with a biological agent in the realm of scientific plausability or have we crossed over into fantasy/myth now? And other things make no sense either. Would the first reaction of a scientist and epidemiologist working for the Centre for Disease Control (ie: the main Character in the book) be to just go along with killing those infected without ever once arguing for the need to even try to find a cure? After all, he believes he is dealing with a virus infecting the local population. These are just some examples of the glaring plot holes that made the novel just ridiculous.In the end the book wasn't scary, it was just plain boring and cheezy. Even the dialogue was woeful. An old man weilding a sword and mouthing the cringe worthy battle cry ""my sword sings of silver"" before lopping off vampires heads made me roll my eyes in frustration. Not to mention that he is in his mid 80's, has a serious heart condition and mangled hands from an encounter earlier in life with ""The Master"". Yet here he was swinging his sword and decapitating vampires like nobodys business. Hope I'm that spritely when (if) I reach that age.Bottom line, although I can certainly respect the fact that each of us have our own tastes and we won't all agree on what constitutes a good story, I just felt the need to give my personal opionion on the book as a counter balance to all the glowing 4 and 5 star reviews out there.",0,0,1,1

So I gave it up and walked away from it.It has some definite perks in that it creates an unusual and interesting universe. I liked its oddball feel. It reminded me of Dune in flavor; it's an entirely different story, but there's a stylistic similarity in that it takes what is ultimately a hard sci-fi idea and wraps it up in a fairly surrealistic manner. There are some familial issues that are definitely Dune-like as well.But when all is said and done, when I got to the middle of the book, I found myself asking ""just where the hell is this book going, anyway?""

R19ZW3XMVIFU7P,"Note: Review updated below on 4/8/18.I read this new book, tried the diet and did not have the succress Haylie Pomeroy touts with this plan.  My mother was a gourmet cook, so I was raised on real food. She didn't allow things like soda, marshmallow fluff or pop tarts in the house. She also thought cold cuts were bad nutrition and cooked her own roasts for sandwiches, which she also thought were poor nutrition anyway. So, I never lived on junk food as a way of life. My problem: Taking a job that required sitting all day for the first time in my life ... and gaining 75 lbs. over 16 years, despite exercise and eating well. And I probably not only gained weight, but changed my metabolism. So, when Haylie's book came out, I decided to try her eating plan.First, eating 6 oz of protein at a meal was more than I could handle and made me nauseous. Fish was easier to handle in that amount, but with today's seafood costing $10-18 per pound, that wasn't going to happen often.Second, all of the carbs and fruit during  Phase 1 on days 1 and 2 threw my blood sugar into the stratosphere. Don't any of her clients have this problem? Oh, right. Haylie Pomeroy is not a physician.Third, I lost 25 pounds during month one and lost no more weight after that, even when I followed the diet for 6 more months and exercised per the plan. What gives? My doctor thought it was too much food for me and too many carbs in Phase 1.But there is another, important reason why I wrote this review ... for patients on blood thinners. Ms. Pomroy claims, ""The Fast Metabolism lifestyle is the way we SHOULD be eating all the time, not just for the 28-day course of the diet! ...There's plenty of flexibility for working around food allergies or sensitivities, and any other restrictions imposed by medical conditions.""  I have friends taking Coumadin or Warfarin. This eating plan does not provide enough modifications for the strict dietary regime of people taking blood thinners unless you follow Phase 3 for 7 days. Anything with Vit K has to be severely limited, which are the mainstays of this eating plan: greens, lettuce and vegetables, many herbs, several fruits, some proteins (beef liver, tuna), tomato products - sauces, salsa, juice, etc. A friend who wanted to follow FMD cannot.The author also suggests drinking half your weight -- in ounces -- of water each day. So, if you weigh 220 lbs., you are supposed to drink 110 ounces of water. Well, not according to my Urologist, who recommended 64-80 oz.a day.Packaged Products Sold on Haylie Pomroy's Web Site: I reviewed the ingredients in the FMD ""packaged"" products from the pills and powders to the bars; my friend cannot eat any of them after checking with his physician because of what they contain (pea protein powder, soy, tocopherals, turmeric, inositol, etc.)  So, if you are taking Coumadin, you will not be able to eat the pre-made products except the Phase 3 protein bars. I think it's better to lose weight using real food.  The author will make a fortune on her packaged goods. Her Bars cost $42.00/box ($3.50 each); 14 servings of Phase 1 Pure Food Powder costs $54.00 + priority shipping method. You could buy a lot of fish for that money. I can buy Optimum Nutrition Organic Whey Powder (best tasting protein powder after BSN Syntha-6) in the 30 serving size for $25.99 and get free shipping. The FMD powder may have a few more grams of protein and carbohydrates, but I can't justify spending $67 on a tub of powdered food replacement. I'd rather eat chicken.All in all, I gave this eating plan two tries, lost the same amount of weight both times (which was a lot less than what I wanted to lose), stalled with no weight loss at the same point each time, and moved on. If a vegetable lover cannot lose weight on this diet, I have no clue what the answer is. All I know is that people should check with their PCP if they want to follow this eating plan because Ms. Pomroy is not an M.D.4/06/18 Update:  I have been meaning to update this review for years and finally got around to it. After reading other books about weight loss, cortisol, insulin resistance, diabetes and obesity, there were several authors I connected with:  Dr. Robert Lustig, Dr. Joseph Mercola, Dr. Jason Fung. The one that was the best for me was Dr. Fung, who wrote The Obesity Code  The Obesity Code: Unlocking the Secrets of Weight Loss  (his newest book is The Diabetes Code  The Diabetes Code: Prevent and Reverse Type 2 Diabetes Naturally ). I learned that meat is converted to amino acids, but when it's eaten in excess it is stored as white AND brown fat. Lightbulb!  Why didn't any other author ever mention this in a ""diet"" book before? Always thought excess protein was digested into amino acids which ""hung out"" until they were needed!  Now I know why I had elevated blood glucose which I never had before and why I was insulin resistant and borderline Type 2 Diabetic after following The Fast Metabolism Diet: too much protein, too much starch, too much fruit, eating too often (i.e., snacks between meals). Dr. Lustig was right in his nutrition class The Bitter Truth: Sugar or products that break down into sugar are toxic!  So the Whole Foods apple with natural peanut butter that I ate 3 hours after lunch wasn't so healthy after all. Thank you to all those doctors who told me to eat 5-6 small meals each day. It didn't work. Grrr.Admittedly, conventional thinking about food and the food pyramid have gone through several changes since the 50s. When we used to eat three squares a day with no snacks in the 60s, we gravitated to a low fat diet in the 70s and grew wary of saturated fat in red meats due to heart attack risk, and moved on in the 90s to 5 or 6 ""feedings"" per day including meals, snacks, protein bars and smoothies, which was diastrous for me. It's time for the USDA to replace the old Food Pyramid calling for 6-11 servings of grains and starch per day for one that focuses on vegetables, protein, healthy fats, fiber and whole grains with notes about sleep and fasting.Through using a LCHF eating plan and ensuring I maintain a 12 hour ""fast"" between dinner and breakfast if not a few longer fasts, I have passed the 25 pound mark and am on my way to lose the rest, and it's only taken 10 years for me to find the right solution to correct insulin resistance and eliminate high blood sugar. Thank you Dr. Jung. Oh, I donated Haylie Pomroy's book to Goodwill because I am sure someone has to lose only 25 pounds. And I also asked my friends to remind me of what I always said before reading The Fast Metabolism Diet, ""How useful can a diet be when the book is written by a someone who's not a doctor?""",0,0,0,0

R2PDNBOAIWB8MA,"I've been on Amazon since the 1990s. This is my first 1 star review. (at least I don't remember giving another one.)I am not exaggerating to say this is among the worst books that I have ever read. How people rate it highly is a mystery to me. If someone rates it highly I am pretty sure they are in fact in need of self help. In fact, I think I need counseling after reading it.My guess is they know the author's religious denominational affiliation and are predisposed to think of it as great for that basis. It is written for adults but it is juvenile and incredibly naive. I would recommend Dr Seuss and any number of children's books over this one to enforce these lessons. You might think I am joking but really I am not.This book might be inspirational and new if you didn't pay any attention to your Jr High and High School literature class or you went to a private religious school where you were shielded from actual literary challenges. Perhaps you might find it inspirational if you haven't actually read a book after graduating high school.Other reviewers have noted the misuse of historic figures. That is true but putting that aside the book is still horridly awful with holes so big one can drive a fleet of trucks through them.It calls these ideas ""decisions."" They are actually ""values."" and of course once one picks a set of values to discuss then necessarily other questions arise. None of those questions or issues are discussed. Instead an unquestioning list of values is presented without any challenge or self-critique.  How do these values conflict? Why these and not others? What OTHER values should NOT be embraced? What values AMONG THERE should not be embraced? When should any one of these values by ignored or replaced by another because of circumstance or should they? Almost none of this is discussed when in fact such questions are key to adhering to or examining and set of values.Take the value ""I will persist without exception."" The narrative given to enforce this is the Angel Gabriel showing a hall of things that didn't come to be because persons did not persist. Of course, the things shown are things that might all be considered good or great. (Let me invent an example for illustration. Someone who would have cured cancer but he/she gave up medical school.) What is not given equal time is that the narrative is so naive it would necessarily include all unspeakable evil that never came to be because someone didn't ""persist.""One can analyze all of these in a similar way. One might respond that I am ""over analyzing"" these values and narratives. On the surface, this is a fair direction for a counter argument. The difficulty with that counter argument is that the values are so poorly and clumsily presented that it doesn't really require much analysis at all. It just requires one be minimally educated and literate.I was forced to read this book for a job where a ""boss"" learned of it from a ""coach."" I almost considered quitting which would have been ironic given that one of the values is about having a ""decided heart."" If I was hiring people and I asked about good books in an interview and this book came up I would drill down further. Unless the job was menial a positive review of this book by an applicant would likely equal disqualification for me.Dear lord I need a shower now.",0,0,1,1

R3HXTY3W6VLLRK,"I'm completely flummoxed as to how this movie received the rave reviews that it did. And why on earth is it considered a comedy? It didn't elicit as much as a grin let alone a chuckle. The main character, Miles, is a middle school English teacher who has been trying to write a book but has been a failure at that endeavor. Not surprising. He's a man who has no qualms about stealing hundreds of dollars from his mother on the one hand but is disgusted by his buddy's infidelity and lack of morals on the other hand. This empty, pathetic character seems to believe that the taste of wine matters. That being able to taste subtle differences in wine ""varietals"" gives him class. And a man who reads a porn magazine entitled ""Barely Legal"" is hardly someone you'd want teaching middle school kids. Miles' buddy, Jack, is even more pathetic. It's as if he's forever stuck in adolescence and he doesn't even want to move forward. It's humiliating to watch an adult behave in such a childish way. And his girlfriend for the week is just as bad. Already has one kid whom she leaves with her mother most of the time. And brings home a guy she just met in a bar and her claim to fame is she has sex like an animal. None of the characters in the movie (except maybe Mia) would be someone you'd want for a friend and have over for dinner, so why would we want to watch two hours of their stupidity?

R30JAN4ZXY934I,"This is a good chair with one glaring flaw. The seat height is set via a clamping mechanism consisting of eight, 1"" x .6"" inch ""stopper rubbers"" made of a type of soft, rubber tubing. (5/16"" ID) The manual states that the stopper rubbers should be changed as an entire set (8) ""if you see any cracking or damage"". I noticed some cracking (see photo) within 9 months of purchase during light use (2-4 hours/wk) and I only weigh 180lbs. I just found out from the manufacturer that replacements cost $6.95 ea ($55.60 for a set of 8) plus shipping of $40. I paid approx. $100 for the chair which means I would essentially need to re-up the original purchase price every year just for maintenance. Several Amazon reviewers suggested using fuel hose from an auto parts store and I'm currently investigating that avenue... most hoses with the correct measurements appear to be $1-$5/foot range so the price is definitely better. The original stopper rubbers appear to be made of a more ""squishy"" rubber... possibly a vinyl or PVC blend. If I find something that works well, I'll try to post it for those who find themselves in the same boat as me. If not, I'll ditch this one and try another suggestion, purchase a highly-rated ""astronomy"" chair.",0,0,0,0

R2Q8VDYZH4G55O,"Except for cinematography by Vittorio Storaro, this film is way over rated. It is totally homophobic. The entire premise of the reason the protagonist was a Fascist murderer is because he thought he accidentally shot and killed a man who molested, or at least tried to molest him once when he was 13. The man was 6-10 years older. So he became a murderer for Mussolini. WTF? What about all those dozen adult men and women who are shown standing two feet away while a dozen kids his age have his pants pulled down and are molesting him en masse, for who knows how many times. No, that would not make him a murderer. The guy who molested him was not a homosexual. He was a child molester, because the boy was prepubescent, presumably. Later in the film, we see the ""homosexual"" trying to pick up a much older male prostitute. I don't think child molesters evolve to like older people as sexual partners, so this is not true to life. He is also shown to be a total wimp, a stereotype. The protagonist's new wife confesses to having been raped for 6 years by a man 50 years older and says she enjoyed it. She seems as normal as anybody in the film. Talk about a double standard! The director should have followed the golden rule of filmmaking: Make films about things you know about. The dialogue, dubbed or not is ridiculous. It's so baldly dubbed, they could have said intelligent things that people might actually say. added bonus, gratuitous exploitation of the star actresses tits. You can see the blue gel wrapping the dance room moving in the wind. The only person not dancing was the Fascist murderer and his assistant. How inconspicuous. Brutally grotesque murder scene tops it off. Francis Ford Coppola, Sidney Lumet, and other filmmaker wrote a letter to talk an American distributor into distributing the film. Perhaps they first should have consulted with their gay friends to see how they felt about being stereotyped in film or on TV as child molesters, too typical of the time the film was made, 1970.",0,0,0,0

I searched the product information on Amazon and on the Epson website and couldn't establish whether or not this new version included that software.  The previous version, WF-3520, included ABBYY FineReader OCR software.  I CALLED EPSON and their representative assured me that the WF-3620 did indeed include the ABBYY FineReader software but you have to use the downloaded software to install, not the included disk.  That is not true.  To make a very long and frustrating story filled with wrong information short, this newer version DOES NOT INCLUDE OCR SOFTWARE.SET UP--Initially set up was easy and straightforward.  We wirelessly connected a Mac desktop, a Windows desktop and a Windows laptop directly from the Epson website.  Printed fine that day and the next.  Three days later, I couldn't print from either desktop; don't know about the laptop.  And the scanner didn't work either (and I didn't try but I don't think it worked with the initial set up).

People can follow any advice they choose and authors can call themselves a doctor if they like.  But authors should disclose from where they received their doctorate degrees.  Readers can assess the author's information and credentials from there.  The idea that one man had Crohn's disease and found a remedy and therefore the whole country ought to follow his diet plan is sheer nonsense.  The idea that the Maker's Diet is based upon Biblical writing is outrageously factitious.  I find no coconut trees in Biblical Palestine on record to produce the coconut oil that is promoted in the book.  I don't find any record of people in the Bible eating soil organisms to stay healthy.  The people who live the longest on the earth are those who consume few calories.  It's not the type of foods they eat, it's the volume of food consumed.  Calorie restriction is an unequivocal method of adding decades to the human life span.  The Bible promoted fasting, wine in moderation, and God provided different diets at different times in the Bible.  There was the Genesis plant food diet.  Then there was the Egyptian captivity diet.  The Israelites longed for fish and garlic once they left Egypt.  Then there is the desert wandering diet where they lived off of manna (probably a lean calorie diet).  Then there is the diet of the Promised Land, the ""land of milk and honey,"" where the Israelites were provided with pomegranates, grapes, apples, flax, fish, dates, raisins, figs, melons, garlic, and a smattering of goat milk and meat when they could find it (without refrigerators foods like these spoiled quickly).  I'd recommend health seekers read the Bible which is much more authoritative than the Maker's Diet book.  --Bill Sardi, Knowledge of Health, Inc, San Dimas, Ca.",0,0,0,0
R16W1LW67WIBKF,"I've had this trimmer for about two weeks now and used it quite a bit.  No problems so far, and when I cut thinner paper with punched edges I start from the middle on out to avoid ripping the delicate edges.  The knife is still sharp and cuts easy, and the trimmer feels solid for the size.  Pleased with it, hopefully it'll be easy to purchase replacement blades.Update, 4-28-11:I've had to severely downgrade my rating based on the terrible replacement blades:  they shred the paper rather than cutting it, the posts don't fit into the opening without force, and last night the blade protector slipped off while I was trying to get the ill fitting replacement blade out again and deeply cut the side of my index finger.  None of the thus far six replacement blades have worked smoothly as did the original one.  I bought the replacement blades at Michaels, and the package says ""for the paper trimmer"".Since I'll be looking for a new trimmer I have to say this one is a waste of money based on its short life.",0,0,0,0

R1UOD5RAXTV356,"I have owned this scale for a couple of weeks and today it went into the garbage can. It has the on off switches located on the side which is inconvenient for my uses because of where I placed it. Why not on front with the Readout? After a couple seconds the scale would lock, so if I wasn't quite quick enough when I added or subtracted food from the scale it would lock. I cannot conceive of a reason that a scale was designed to quit working in the middle of weighing something. After looking at the Chinese instructions and some Chinese take-out to get me in the mood, I could not find a way to turn of that ""feature"". There is only two ways to turn the scale back on to a usable status. First, turn it off, and then on and then wait for it to start up, or remove what you are weighing and wait about 10 or 15 seconds and then place the item back on the scale.The size of the platform is what made me try it and that is the only reason I gave it two stars.

R2B86Z2459LW7S,"When the most popular reviews are talking about trying to decipher how to put the staples in the stapler to get it to work, it’s a problem. I even tried googling how to do it and that didn’t help. I was literally 1 minute away from returning the item when I had the idea to check the page for the same brand staples I bought with the stapler. There was actually a video for how to install the staples ONLY under the staples themselves. Why wouldn’t they also include that video for the stapler!???? If they couldn’t bother including specific instructions for this complicated way to install the staples, I can’t bother leaving a good review. So far it works as advertised and I’m worried it’ll randomly fail like other people says theirs did. I’m Extremely frustrated and I’ve ordered more complicated things that required installation from Amazon and this irritated me more.

R3MQOSAQ7RBH2O,"First bought this product last year and was very happy with those envelopes. The original order came as shown in the advertising pictures on the product page... nice quality envelopes in a nice box. Same red product box as shown. Used them up, so I reordered, expecting the same product. Why wouldn't I? Sadly,  what I received this time wasn't even close!This time, what I received was exactly what you see in pictures I've attached to the review. First, no product box at all. Just a pile of loose envelopes in bubble wrap, shipped in a plain Amazon Bag...no product box, nor Amazon shipping box.Even worse, the envelopes are not the same either. They may or may not be the same weight of paper, though they feel lighter weight. The flaps for closing are about half the size of the prior envelopes, and the one I pulled out had almost NO adhesive on it at all. The interior privacy markings were also of a different pattern including the mfgr name now, and less privacy marking overall as well. IOW, They look nothing like the pictures on the product page. I could live with the cheap haphazard packaging, but for the envelopes themselves to be completely different and of lesser quality...this is just sad.Give how the product has changed to a much lower quality envelope, combined with lack of packaging, and haphazard shipping, this product listing is at best, misleading...and bordering on bait and switch.

Shortly after the printer complained that magenta cartridge was not installed.. Cartridge re-seated, but magenta still doesn't print.. I  was printing something that didn't really all the colors so I let it sit.  Then today I need to print some photos for a school project.  half through one 4x6"" photo all colors fade.  I printed probably 15 pages all together since the cartridges were installed, including a couple of color tests and clean print head pages.  I removed the cartridges thinking that they must be re-seated again.  They were empty.""That was quick,"" - I thought.  I installed a new set.Half of a 4x6 photo came out almost right, but the other half became unnaturally blue.  I reprinted it again.  Very blue through the photo.  Adjusted the photo digitally for more yellow tint (not original cartridges, probably the yellow is not bright enough?).  Reprinted - super blue.  got yellow cartridge out.  the cartridge itself is contaminated with blue.  Strange, I didn't see it before.  Did cleaning, printed color test.  All colors were way off.  Magenta square had a wide blue line in it.  Orange had a wide green.I pulled the whole print head and found it flooded with ink.  I guess that's where all the ink went from the first set!  Looked inside of the printer - the pad that remove excessive ink was full of goo.  Big ink spot where the cartridge rests.  Even if I replace the print head the pad still needs to be replaced too or it will contaminate it all over again.  Basically the printer is dead.

I usually do a through research before I purchase any product, however, I haven't with this one, trusted the sales guy to lead me to a great product for a replacement of my leaked ink HP PhotoSmart 8250 printer (which I've owned since 2008) by the way Thee BEST Photo printer by far. I wish I would have Read Reviews first!I installed, registered and setup everything as instructed and it worked flawlessly except from the mobile devices. I have a very wide knowledge in software troubleshooting as I am tech savvy, so I did some digging and finally found an app that works with my all of my android devices, so that was a problem solved. Now mind you, if you're not as tech savvy as I am, an average person wouldn't be able to figure it out as the Epson website does not have a solution to the problem. I have printed about 50-60 pages since 5 days ago, Today 12/05/16 I turn the printer on and it runs through it's head cleaning, then stops, shuts off, just to turn back on and do it over and over and over and over, you get the point. Ink was full, now completely gone! I cannot connect to the printer neither through wireless or usb connection at all, to manually reset it or fix. Epson has no solution and neither does internet for the problem I'm experiencing, and it won't even give me any error, NONE! Per Epson's user guide, I've disconnected printer from the outlet and pull the plug out of the printer, did a reset by holding down power and stop button for 7 seconds or more, waited 15 seconds then plug everything back to no avail! I'm attaching a video I took of the problem I'm experiencing with this printer, so you can see what I'm talking about. BTW, I had to stop the recording because it took over 4 minutes and it still wouldn't stop, very very frustrating!Thank goodness I'm still within a 14 day period so I can get a full refund, oh and I bought a 2yr warranty because the sales guy kept on with it, I now see why! I will never buy another Epson product again! I still own NX110 that I only used for scanning and fax because my HP was for printing photo and color pages.

The fact that this teenage girl would not know '70's punk rock while being born in the 90's and having a dumb blonde for a friend who wouldn't know Richard Hell from the Germs? The dialogue is SO over the top and unbelievable that a loner indie kid would actually talk that way. oh I forgot - the old soul vibe which is supposed to make her ""cool"". Her only options seems to be abortion or giving the kid to snotty yuppies. Wow, what fantastic choices. Way to have any kind of morals about the living thing inside you.  Her comments about the unborn child ""it"" as she refers to it are borderline offensive yet for no reason her step-mom encourages this type of mentality. And OF COURSE your parents are not only supportive of your teenage pregnancy but have witty one-liners to spout about it as well. And poor Michael cera - treated as a sperm-producing punching bag. He has no say in what is going on and only after the abortion and the yuppies fall through that Juno ""realizes"" they must have been in love all along and knocks on his door saying ""surprise! since I have nowhere better to go you are the father so be happy"" and Michael Cera has no option but to deal with it. Horrible dialogue which mo one should have to endure, unbelievable and rude storyline. Maybe this was made for people who watch things like Delta Farce and American Pie type of mentality. This movie is just a slap in the face to anyone who has a brain and some decent morals. There is a reason it was denied any awards. PS - why do people use the word ""indie"" for this movie? It has major stars and a big budget. I would just use the word ""boring"". A horrible snapshot of ignorant youth more concerned about being obssessed with nostalgic music and horror flicks rather than dealing with the living mistake now inside her.

The pictures only make sense if you are refilling the same model number which I was not.  Let's fast forward.I got out newspaper for the table and gloves for me.  I carefully assembled all the materials. Carefully removing the label as indicated, I inserted the needle into the black inkbottle and drew a small amount into the needle.  Then I inserted it into the small hole on the cartridge.  I very slowly injected ink into the cartridge.  Better safe than sorry.  I repeated the process with the color cartridges.  I put the cartridge labels back in place.  Then I re-installed the cartridges in my printer.  The good news:  the printer recognized them as HP, but showed them as empty or nearly empty.

The crown is not sharp and would barely annoy a potential attacker.  You could do more damage with your fingers, and the tip end (with the point retracted) would be less effective than a standard BIC pen.  Moreover, trying to unscrew the device to expose the tip for writing usually results in the device separating with the threads becoming exposed (as noted by another reviewer).

R3DZL05IA5XQFA,"Although my rating for this is 2 stars - one of my lowest ratings ever for a DVD - I'm going to be up front with you, be honest and say:  This movie MAY be right up your alley.  It really depends on how willing you are to overlook a story that could have been written by a high school prom committee that suddenly found themselves in possession of several cameras and 50 million dollars worth of special effects.You've HEARD (or read) the plot outline, right?  New Ice Age comes and covers most of the Northern Hemisphere and a handful of smart/brave Americans save..... well, they don't save all of the Northern Hemisphere, but they at least save themselves.Dennis Quaid is a good and reliable actor, and in some roles I can readily accept him.  As an almost-washed-up Texas High School Baseball coach I buy it.  As one of the ""Cutters"" in ""Breaking Away"", he was powerful and brooding.  In ""Day"" he plays basically the genius scientist who predicts disaster but those dummies in the government don't believe him.  Not only was it hard for me to believe him in this role - I kept telling myself that it is a pretty weak ""save the world"" movie that essentially uses a weatherman as it's hero.Ian Holm is absolutely fantastic and totally believable as an ally weatherman over in Britain, but Sir Ian's screen time is minimal and his character disappears before the 2nd act, never to be heard from again.The ""star"" of the movie, of course, are the special effects, and they LOOK good.  But while I'm watching a guilty-pleasure extended sequence where a whole herd of tornadoes waltz through Los Angeles I was thinking....""just HOW was it that global warming causing disturbances in the polar ice cap and North Atlantic caused tornadoes in Southern California?""I'd buy ""El Nino"" or the recent string of Hurricanes through Florida first.The ""fun"" parts of this movie could have been condensed into a 15 minute special effects extravaganza and left out the absolutely ludicrous and impossible stories about our heroes and their impossible survival through a cold front so cold that earlier in the movie 3 British Helicopters are frozen in mid-air and crash - just from the cold.  To emphasize how cold it is one of the crewmen starts clawing his way out of the downed chopper, before freezing solid beginning at the tip of his nose.Our little band of characters, the ones we KNOW are going to ""make it"" not only live through that wave of cold air - but there are scenes where we see them running ahead of the freeze.... in sort of the same way teenagers flee from Jason in the Friday 13th movies.So.... if you want to see a lot of North America wiped out by bad weather - you've come to the RIGHT movie.

R33RTLP7LK7E77,"An outrageously unfunny comedy that tries way too hard to think outside the box.  I literally did not crack a smile the entire movie.  Yes, a few lines were perhaps amusing, but definitely not laugh-out-loud funny, and simply not enough of them to make this a good comedy in my book.I found it to be a really bad movie all around: the story is not plausible, the characters are not believable, the dialogue was horrific, and I did not much care for the soundtrack.  Now, the acting was not bad (I actually walked away from this movie respecting Jennifer Gardner as an actress for the first time), but that is not enough to save the movie.I have to agree  whole-heartedly with all the reviewers who stressed that the movie has horrible, HORRIBLE dialogue.  It seems they tried so hard to make every line provocative and edgy, they ended up sucking every ounce of life and credibility out of them, for the sake of quirkiness.The plot of the movie felt half-baked in its unexplained contradictions:1.  Like many other reviewers said, Juno sounds like she's 30.  How does a girl that mature, who knew so much about abortion clinics, who did not have any religious imperatives not to use contraception, who did NOT have sex in the throws of the passion, etc. not think to use a condom, to begin with?  I just don't buy it.  And this undermines the entire premise.2.  Juno discusses peeing on a stick with a convenience store clerk (in a small town!), with a somewhat hostile clerk at that, in the presence of others, as well, and then, at some point, she complains that she is the target of looks and gossip at school?  This does not seem to compute.  Either she's such a free spirit, or so out of touch with reality, that she does not care, in which case, she should not care about the rumors, either (and I understand that teens can be cruel and could get even to such an aloof person, but we see no real nastiness going on in the movie).  And if she does care about her reputation at school, has she considered not waving the stick in people's faces?  If she cares, would she really want everyone to know that she had a pregnancy scare, if it turns out to be a false alarm?3.  There was 0 chemistry between Juno and her ""love"".  He had the appeal of a half-dried jellyfish in the movie.  Their relationship was not at all well penned, I felt not progression, no eye-opening moments, nothing.  Sure, not all love is at first sight, and sometimes you do realize that you're in love with someone who's been around for ages, but in that case, it'd be nice to at least get a glimpse of why this guy is great for this girl, and we get next to nothing to work with here.4.  There WAS relatively believable chemistry between her and the adoptive father.  However, it really annoyed me that when she discovered he was going to get a divorce, she was SHOCKED, even though she was slow-dancing with him and putting her head on his chest as he was revealing it, and she came over to begin with knowing full well he'd be home and his working wife would be away.  And she can't even claim being oblivious, because her stepmother spelled it out for her earlier.5.  In front of the abortion clinic, Juno tells her classmate of a girl, who OD-ed on her meds and lost it at the mall pool.  The classmate responds by saying ""I heard that was you"".  So, Juno has a major depression problem, but that is the first and last time we hear of it.  Why even mention it, if you will just wave it away later?I could nitpick more, but these are, in my opinion, crucial points, and they all were unrealistic, unexplained, or underdeveloped.While I actually liked the characters of her Dad and step Mom, I found their reaction utterly unrealistic.  While it could be refreshing to have an alternative to the mandatory freak-out session that usually ensues after such an announcement in other movies, no amount of leniency, open-mindednes, and hipness can vaccinate you against this game-changer.  Even if you do not intend to disown your daughter, and are ready to back her, no matter what she decides to do, it is STILL a health risk (especially for a clinically depressed teen!), a potential detriment to education, a financial burden on everyone in the family, etc.  So, I feel like the movie went too far in trying to downplay the gravity of the situation.Same goes for the best friend.  We hardly know why they are best friends, and I do believe that the best friend was supposed to be a cheerleader, and yet, she hangs out with an ""outcast"" (and don't even get me started on Hollywood repeatedly attempting to convince us that beautiful smart girls can't fit in), sticks with her through the entire pregnancy, when others, supposedly, avoid her, AND joyously and actively participates in the birthing of Juno's child!  Are there friends like that, at 16?  Perhaps, I hope so.  But it's just one perfect character too many.I rarely feel compelled to write a movie review, because, unlike a Kindle or some other tangible object, what works and what does not is not always something verifiable and reproducible, or even ""explainable"".  Still, more often than not, I can recognize the merits of a movie even when I don't like it.  This movie was just so far removed from what I expected based on the hype, that I decided to add my two cents in support of those who found the movie weak and undeserving of the praise (and I found out here - an Oscar for the screen play???  really???).",0,0,0,0

At 70% through the book I promised a friend if I read one more word of this dark and gloomy book I would pay them $25.00!  This book was THAT hard to take.  Here's the thing ...

Those things keep me in love with the characters in the stories, even if the stories are tragic and the characters often make weird decisions.  You want to walk away from the last page feeling changed - empowered to face your own challenges - and think about the novel days, months, even years later.  This book just needed more editing.

R3KNKWLLTJSFAQ,"A lot of reviews shower this author with praise for his presumed wit - according to his own website, The Sunday Times, for example, found it ""extraordinary"". On the website, he then goes on to helpfully inform the public that last year ""I was named one of Granta's Best of Young British Novelists"". It pains me to disagree with Mr Beauman's apparently stellar opinion of himself, but I think they are a teeny little bit off the mark there. In reference to a certain kind of author, the adjective ""unreadable"" could qualify as a compliment, implying, for example, complexity that masks great depth. It pains me a lot to even mention the names of authors such as Pynchon or Wallace in the same paragraph, but suffice to say, with regard to Ned Beauman, my use of the word ""unreadable"" is meant in the literal sense only. This book is shockingly bad. Far from witty and smart, Beauman simply comes across as the pathetically conceited young guy who can't write a single readable sentence. Please, please, do yourself a favour and do not buy this book.Update/Edit: Another reviewer now mentions that Beauman's father is a publisher. To me that explains a lot, if not everything. Please, please do yourself a favour and read a few of the negative reviews; relying only on the reviews in Tatler won't give you the full picture.",0,0,0,0
R18NN6FJQJOFIQ,"July 10th, Price ^ 62%.  Yikes.  Short take: It's well made, easy to assemble, and does what it's supposed to do.  I would normally give it a 5-star.  So why the 1-star?  I believe in honesty.  Look at the dimensions listed: 27x17x7.6.  Now that's bizarre, obviously.  It's not 7.6 inches in any dimension.  Dimensions can be critical, in my case 27"" high would not fit under my desk, but in reality it does.  That works for me.  It's top is level with my sitting down kneecap.  Many will be irritated that it's not 4"" higher (which would be close to the arm-rest on your chair.  I suspect that once upon a time, it was that height.Decent price was ~$22, now it's $36 with a hyped-up ""retail"" of $45.  IMHO, not worth it now from a price POV alone.It is 20 3/4"" high (to fit under something, remember the folders have tabs that stick up farther.  It is 12 5/8"" wide.  The width needed to accommodate regular hanging folders.  It is 15 3/8"" deep, the width to accommodate legal hanging folders (as shown in the product photo).  Yes, you can use either, as you wish.It's quite short. It's height is level with my knee.  I'd like it higher but it's OK, and shorter makes shorter box which makes it cheaper to ship and it is a very good price at $26.98 the lowest price has been $21, it does bounce around (price-wise) between $27 and $21 and has been out of stock for quite a while.

Both my wife and myself have a wide range in movie interest, however my wife fell asleep 3/4 of the way through it and I couldn't wait for the movie to end.The primary focus of the movie was on Paul Giamatti, and wine tasting. The only way the writers could have made the movie any slower was if they had cheese tasting, too.Paul Giamatti is a very good actor, but the part he played within this movie was extremely slow and whiney. To be honest, the whole movie was slow and tame, except when Paul Giamatti's co-star, Thomas Haden Church, was given the spot light to interact with the other characters.The editors and director could have trimmed out a large part of Paul Giamatti's character and made him the secondary character within the story. They should have focused more on making Thomas Haden Church the main character of the story, and they would have made the movie a bigger sell.If you are from northen California (wine country), you may be the only ones that really enjoy this movie.",0,0,0,0

R2OH8TPE0UYHTC,"I was excited by this purchase and thought I had done my research. Reviews stated that it was easy to set up and worked right out of the box. That was not my experience. The printer was returned after four hours of attempting to install and troubleshoot; two of those four hours were with an HP tech remoting my desktop as we both worked to fix whatever connectivity issue the printer had. He could not solve the problem.Highlights:1. Needing to use USB connection to set up wireless printing. Why? The whole point is that it's wireless, yes? Anyway, I did not look forward to completing the same wired install on every device in my house.2. After installing program I was unable to ""find"" the printer, mostly because it kept turning itself off. Repeatedly. In fact it wouldn't stay on, and sometimes it was on when the power light was off, but sometimes not. So...absolutely no  way to indicate if the thing was on or off.3.  In attempting to locate troubleshooting information I suddenly, and angrily, realized that this is an HP product. That's my mistake. I did not realize that HP had purchased Samsung. I bought the Samsung to replace an HP product that decided to not connect to anything (despite all signs saying it was connected, and no changes to system or network) after a year and a half of light use printing. I plan on taking the old printer into the yard and ""Office Spacing"" it with a baseball bat since no one at HP seems able to help me. So, new printer...and hey, surprise, I accidentally fell right back into the HP trap. HP computers are okay. HP printers are flimsy unsupported crap.4. Install did not recognize the serial number on its own product. So, that's a thing. I don't know what it means, but it's a thing. And it happened. Troubleshooting on HP website also did not recognize the serial number and provided limited information without it. Does this mean it is a fake? I have no idea.5. Took about an hour for me to give up and get in touch with HP customer service. Surprise! The phone lines are closed on the weekends, and the troubleshooter is useless AF.6. FINALLY got through to customer service on chat. Thankfully the tech on duty didn't treat me like an idiot (this happens). We ran down the list of things I had already tried, and I begrudgingly decided to allow him remote access to my computer. I hate having to resort to this. Hate it!7. Spent two hours fidgeting with settings, getting frustrated with the automatic turn off. Finally it printed a test page while connected to desktop with  USB, but we could not discover the problem with wireless. The printer is NO USE to me as a wired printer.8. After four total hours of trying to get the printer to do its one job,  print wirelessly, we gave up. The tech didn't know what to do next, so I thanked him and said I was done. I uninstalled, fixed the settings we had changed, and went to return.9. The irony of needing to print a return label for a printer is worthy of note. I sent it to a friend and asked him to print it.I am not amused. Attempting to get this stupid printer to work on a HP desktop running Win10 was ridiculous. I lost 4 hours of my life, and a trip to the UPS store and back to return it to Amazon. Now I have to go find another option and am printerless again.",0,0,0,0
RCA4JM1T8ZKD6,"I really looked forward to getting to see this movie for the first time.  As a huge Pegg/Frost fan, I expected the same type of intelligent humor that they have brought to so many of their other films.  Unfortunately, Paul was a huge disappointment.  That is not to say that it did not have it's funny moments, it certainly did.  The problem was is that they were few and too far between.  The ongoing ""nods"" to other science fiction films was also highly enjoyable.  The main problem came when the alien started talking.  Seth Rogan????  Are you freaking kidding me?  They could have picked any voice actor in the world and they picked Rogen?  Major flaw and disappointment.  Every time Paul spoke all I could see was Rogan's face and lame one-dimensional delivery of his lines (like every other movie he does). The movie would have been immensely better if they would have just picked someone else.  This was a total failure that I just could not get past.The real star of the movie is Jason Bateman.  He played the perfect ""straight man"" in this ""could-have-been-great"" comedy. His delivery and performance was far superior to everything else on the screen.Pegg and Frost did what they do best, just not as good as they have done in the past.  Going bigger and better than Shaun of the Dead will always be a challenge, but I enjoy watching Pegg try to pull it off.  It is a shame that he had to play against the failing voice work of Rogen.  Have I mentioned how bad Rogen was yet?  It is not that the lines or ""writing"" of the alien was bad.  I enjoyed his ""attitude and style.""  Rogen's voice simply did not match the character.Sure the film is full of crude humor (more fitting for the 14 yr old boy crowd than anything else) but I could have seen past that had Rogen's voice not been so annoying.  The anti-American and anti-Christian themes wore out their welcome rather quickly as well.  We get it, you think Christianity is dumb.  You made your ""artistic statement.""  Understand, you are in the minority.  Get over it and move on.  You do not have to bash us over the head with it.As a science fiction fan and someone who would really have enjoyed this ""trip of a lifetime"" (even without the alien and certainly without Rogen's voice) I truly wanted to love this movie.  Heck, the movie would have been even better had they left the alien out of it and just made it a ""nerd-buddy"" movie.  Then again, that would have given me exactly what I wanted and would have earned this film 5 stars...yeah, no Rogen!Truly, I expect better from Pegg/Frost.  I hope I will get it next time.",0,0,0,0

RKL2XUQEH4TF4,"My rating was lowered from four stars to two stars after I had to add update number 2.  Definitely pass on this one.This is a large unit.  I use it in an elementary classroom.  The sharpener dials to fit six different pencil sizes which is very convenient for the classroom.  It has an adequate shaving recepticle and is easily emptied.  (I also use the  Stanley Bostitch QuietSharp Executive in the classroom. That unit is more quiet than this one is and it is smaller. It does not handle varied sizes and that recepticle is quite small.)  The Swingline unit is very easy for the children to use and we do not have problems with jamming--I stopped using electric sharpeners in the classroom for several years because of jamming.  The swingline sharpens pencils smoothly as well.UPDATE #1:After using this a bit longer in the classroom I feel the need to update the review. The sharpener jams up and stops working. Sometimes leaving it idle for a short time is enough and we can then sharpen a few pencils but other times we go for days with it not working. Although this is in a classroom it does not get heavy use as we have more than shaprener in the room. It seems that the sensor for activating the sharpener is really faulty.UPDATE #2: this sharpener tends to implement the safety that prevents it from ""overheating"" a bit too readily.  After two pencils being sharpened, it often shuts down.  Although it has various openings, it also is a bit ""touchy"" about how the pencil is inserted.  My original rating is 4 stars but I think I would have to reduce that to 3 stars.  I find my cheaper units to be more reliable.A custodian knocked the unit onto the floor and the black plastic around the opening cracked. If the plastic is held just right it will partially sharpen still.  I think it is disappointing that the motor is OK but a crack in the housing prevents us from still using this unit.",0,0,0,0

R8IP14SMJSRU2,"After reading the reviews I ordered two, hoping that one of them would work. As expected, actually one of them worked, the other one was completely dead. Unfortunately there are virtually no alternatives for 9mm pencils that work with batteries. (If you know of any, please comment).The good thing with this sharpener is that the blade and the motor are basically fine and the construction is so simple that most issues are easy to spot and fix: If you unscrew the screw in the battery compartment you can take off the top part to look inside. It needs a bit of force because there are two latches in the front. Take care not to lose the little black plastic switch next to the sharpener hole. Don't bother trying to take off the bottom part. You don't need to.In my case, one of the contacts in the battery compartment was not soldered properly, so I fixed the solder joint and it worked. Also, the security mechanism that keeps the blade from moving when the front cover is not attached, is extremely flimsy. If you have no children or other people in your household who may try to touch the rotating blade, I recommend getting rid of that mechanism and simply soldering the two metal pieces near the front of the device together. If you do not solder, duct tape will work just fine. While you are at it, check if the two metal pieces next to the sharpener hole touch properly when you insert a pencil. If not, adjust and secure with duct tape. ^^Now you can put it back together. Make sure that the little black plastic switch is in place before you close the top. I haven't run into any more problems for a coup;e of months since fixing it so I hope it will work for you, too.",0,0,0,0

R3H0YW1Q995HO0,"So I bought this pen because I draw a lot. I heard it has a super fine tip and does not smudge. It dries immediately and a highlighter could be used in seconds. And I found this to be true (and loved it!) However, the reason why I gave it a 2 star was because of its ink flow and the way the nib was made. I felt like the nib was scratching the surface of my paper (leaving little pen scratch marks) It wasn't as smooth and I could hear/feel the pen scraping the paper as I write and draw. Now I’m not sure if this was a defect on my order, but the two pens I got were definitely not good. In addition, the pen would clog up, and no ink would run through it as I write (this got really annoying). And once I cleaned the nib, the ink would continuously bleed (“explode”) and eventually clog up again (it was a never ending cycle).Overall, if this pen were to work properly (ex. Consisted ink flow and smoother nib) then I would rate this pen a 5star. But as of right now and the way it acts up for me. I do NOT recommend these pens to artists/heavy note takers that want to draw/write without ink flow issues and pen scratch marks.",0,0,0,0

R451UAAXQYT9C,I have an Epson 8350 and the oem lamp lasted about 1000 hours and I was shocked to see that a replacement was over $200 from Epson directly.

R2SW7LQG70J85D,"Bought this for my husband and we read the whole thing cover to cover. It's not all bad, but I would only give it 2 stars.First, the good:Amazing ideas, easy to read, and sometimes pretty funny without being overly cheesy or lame.Some ideas include a list of stellar excuses to keep those ""difficult"" relatives and friends from holding the baby (things like, ""His rash is contagious"" or ""projectile diarrhea"" for instance, page 11), how to identify different cries, how to keep fit while watching the little one, tips for sleep deprived dads, and so forth. The jokes are pretty funny at times but there is still a ton of useful information for every stage of development.The bad:Many of the suggestions in this book are for couples who are in a certain income bracket (read: if you want a baby on a shoestring budget, this book isn't for you), and the suggestions on how to deal with a spouse who has just given birth are a little juvenile and reminded us both of the 1950's. Other negative points are that this book doesn't leave much room for parents who might want to go against the norm in terms of television exposure and sleeping arrangements. For instance:This book suggests that dads decorate and essentially take possession of a room of their own. For those who don't have the space in their homes, the author suggests that apartment dweller use a ""walk-in closet"" (p.89). Really? Does he expect every parent to have access to spare rooms and walk in-closets? Plenty of families live with neither and dads do just fine. While I agree that an ""escape from baby"" is something many new dads might need, the authors offer no alternatives for families who live in a lower income bracket or simply don't have the space. He also suggests buying all kinds of things, like multiple (over 5) pacifiers, and other nifty baby-gadgets that might not be in everyone's budget.Some other suggestions are a little questionable, such as bringing your baby to a race track or a dog run (p. 154-155), dosing your baby with medicine on a plane ride (p.197), serving liquor at a child's 1st birthday party to supervising adults (p. 213), filling an old sock with apples and giving it to a teething baby (p. 108), and my personal fave, what to do if you're camping with your baby in ""bear country"" and you encounter a bear (p. 210-211).If that doesn't beat all, the opinion of women in this book is a little insulting to say the least. My personal fave here is the suggestion that a man drop ""subtle hints"" to his partner, such as ""I read somewhere that sex has been shown to reduce stress and ease back and neck pain. Not only that, but it can also help your skin retain elasticity and retard the aging process. Isn't that interesting?"" (p. 93). Is this guy for real? Is there a woman on earth that would either find that subtle, let alone be turned on by that? I can just see it now, ""Hey sexy, I've been feeling a little saggy and old-looking, and my neck is killing me, think we should head up to the bedroom?"" Yes, after pushing a baby out of one's body, one's libido might come to a crashing halt for awhile (understandably so), but to suggest ""a high-speed internet connection"" (p.92) to the man who is still waiting to get some seems a little unnecessary (if a man is watching porn, or playing World of Warcraft to get through the post-delivery slump in his sex life, he certainly doesn't need to be reminded of this option, not to mention the many men out there who don't think looking at porn or playing video games is the wisest thing to be doing when their partner is recovering from delivery). Seriously? A high-speed internet connection? Seems like something a teenage boy might resort to, not a new father who is sleep deprived and genuinely interested in helping his partner recover. Another great opinion of women can be found on the section on bottle feeding. Apparently one's partner ""may start sobbing, seeing the bottle as an early symbol that your baby is leaving the nest"" (p. 59). Maybe I'm not as irrational as some other mothers, but a baby bottle is hardly what I'd call a symbol of ""leaving the nest."" A box of condoms and maybe a college application, but not a baby bottle.Another thing my husband and I found somewhat immature was the first place ribbons on a picture of a woman's breasts (p. 18) to show that breast milk is best. Now, I get that this is meant to be humorous, and cute, but seriously? Most people know that breast milk is best, no need to slap a couple of first place ribbons on a woman's chest like a pig at the county fair to make this point.Finally, if you're among those couples that might have various opinions on co-sleeping, or television exposure, or the ""cry-it-out"" method of having a child stay in his own crib at night, don't expect much variation on the pros and cons. The authors seem to be pro-co-sleeping, pro-television, and pro-""cry-it-out"". They're also pro-pacifier, which many parents disagree with, because like another reviewer said, God help you the day you don't have one available!The book itself isn't a total loss, but I would suggest you read this in addition to other books, and to really question the authors' positions in terms of what is best for you, and your family. There are some great ideas in terms of baby-proofing the house, games to play, ways to ease baby, and other neat tips, but go out of your way to read up on certain issues and don't take this book as the final authority on fatherhood. And for the love of God, don't assume your partner is going to be a weepy, saggy, irrational mess of tears and runny snot every minute of the day. Some women out there are tough, ready for motherhood, and understand the hardships that many new fathers face. Remember, not every woman will call you names and attempt to bash your face in with a bedpan during and after delivery. Some of us just love our families and accept that certain pains (and recovery from those pains) are just the unavoidable part of parenthood.",0,0,0,0

R95WVZY8YSAQ4,"I really don't get how people liked this movie so much, or how it won awards.This movie was painful to watch.  It was one of few movies that I was just waiting for it to be over.  When she had the baby I was relieved because that meant it would end soon.I kept my mouth shut so my girlfriend could enjoy it, but she hated it too.It was so wrong to advertise Michael Cera as a co-star.  He was in this film hardly at all.  Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner has much more screentime.  Cera was the reason I saw the movie, and his lacking just made it more disappointing.  If you like Arrested Development and Superbad, this is NOT the movie for you. (I love Arrested Development, Superbad was ok.)The soundtrack was also horrible, just like the ""art"" (or whatever you call it) for the movie intro.  It was like Napolean Dynamite, except much worse and whiny.  This director needs a good slap on the head, to snap out of this stupid artsy garbage.  How can people buy that?  Did critics actually think it was artsy in a good way?  All it did was make me roll my eyes.The story and morals of this movie are good.  I still found the overall story and message to be solid.

R3DJ99DQVMOWMT,"As a fan of Lord of the Flies and someone very interested in the subject matter of this novel - the interface between anatomically modern humans and Neanderthals - I was really looking forward to reading this book.  Sadly, it failed to deliver either in terms of the story and writing quality I expect of Golding or as an interesting exploration of its topic.Golding's portrayal of the Neanderthals - the main characters of the book through whose eyes we experience its events - suffers from outdated notions of these intelligent and resourceful hominins as bestial if likable buffoons.  One wonders how these dunderheads survived the harshest imaginable conditions for hundreds of thousands of years.Apart from that, I think Golding had the right idea, imagining a group of anatomically modern humans appearing as newcomers and coming into conflict with the indigenous Neanderthals.  It's fertile ground for drama and Golding does not fail completely to exploit it.  But as another reviewer commented, I think his ambition exceeded his grasp, and whether it's because he chose to imagine his main character as a Palaeolithic ""Rain Man"" or because his literary powers weren't chugging on all cylinders, Golding did not attain the clarity, coherence, or emotional impact I expected of him.

R25X972FUYCMU4,"I confess that I'm not much of a Steve Carell fan, but I approached this film with higher expectations because of the overall cast and the generally upbeat reviews. A romantic comedy that is virtually laugh-free,  about a dull, straight-laced man (Carell) who, faced with divorce from his neglected wife (Juianne Moore) hooks up with a successful swinger (Ryan Gosling) who teaches him how to pick up women in a local bar. And that is the sum and substance of the film, which after over an hour of tedium and unconvincing situations, we suddenly have a deeply felt scene between the amazing Ryan Gosling and the equally interesting Emma Stone that seems to have wandered in from another film. Sadly, the feeling doesn't last, and the film loses its footing very quickly. There are several other subplots, and they all collide during the very frantic, not very funny penultimate scene, followed by a finale that features Carell and is squirm-inducing.For the record I had rented this film, and was so depressed when it was over, I watched ""The Americanization of Emily,"" the 1964 satire with the wonderful pairing of James Garner and Julie Andrews, written by the brilliant Paddy Chayefsky, and once again found it funny, touching and altogether brilliant...in other words, all the things that ""Crazy, Stupid, Love"" is not.",0,0,0,0

Go back and read your earlier Scarpetta stories like Postmortem, Body of Evidence, and All That Remains - and then write another Scarpetta novel wherein she actually solves a FRESH case without ruminating on her past or Benton.  And for heaven's sake, do something with Marino!  He has become an unlovely caricature of his former self.  His unrequited love for Kay is really old, as is the Chandonne family story line.

R3A0K7SMTC77JG,"**This review may contain spoilers""There's an old Twilight Zone episode, a fantasy-drama called 'The Trouble with Templeton' which came out during the iconic show's second season.  It's a similar concept to 'Midnight in Paris'.  Templeton is a fading stage director who believes that his glory days were back in the 20s and gets the opportunity go back there and learn an important lesson.  Unlike the Twilight Zone episode, Woody Allen's story is more of a romantic comedy.  It features Owen Wilson as a hack Hollywood screenwriter who aspires for more as a high brow novelist.  Wilson is the protagonist, Gil,  who's vacationing in Paris with his fiancee and her parents.  Wilson delivers many of Woody Allen's expressions in the same way as 'The Master' and that's probably why Woody praises him vociferously during the news conference extra in the DVD bonus section.As in many other Woody Allen films, the protagonist is friendly with another couple, with the male partner depicted as a pretentious intellectual.  Woody also gets his ubiquitous digs in at right wingers, making jokes at the Tea Party's expense, through the mouth of the father-in-law to be, a corporate executive who decidedly is in the Republican camp.  As usual, Woody's protagonist must move on from a failed relationship with a woman at the end; in this case, it's the fiance, Inez, perkily played by Rachel McAdams.The central conceit of 'Midnight in Paris' is Gil's time traveling back to the 1920s in Paris.  Woody doesn't come up with a very clever mode of transport: a limousine from the 20s appears out of the blue at midnight on a Parisian street and whisks our protagonist back to those heady days where he runs into the likes of Zelda and F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway.During the news conference on the DVD, Woody makes it clear that his intent is to satirize the artistes who Gil runs into.  At first, it's rather neat to watch a perennially intoxicated Zelda Fitzgerald do her thing as well as listen to Cole Porter at at the piano, but soon we realize that Woody has little to say about these iconic figures.  Hemingway isn't very amusing blathering about all his macho concerns and Picasso shows up merely as a buffoon, seducing one woman after another.  Adrien Brody tries his best to suck out humor from a pretentious Salvador Dali but ultimately is unable to come up with anything funny.  There's a brief, slightly humorous bit where Gil suggests to the surrealist film director, Bunuel, the concept for his classic picture, ""The Exterminating Angel"", with the exasperated director rejecting it since he tells Gil that it doesn't make any sense.  Kathy Bates has little to do as Gertrude Stein, except offering her critique of Gil's new manuscript.A good part of 'Midnight' has to do with Gil's infatuation with Adriana, one of Picasso's cast-offs.  When Gil finds Adriana's autobiography at a bookseller in the present, he learns that he gave her a pair of earrings back in the 20s. This leads to an awkward scene where he attempts to steal Inez's earrings in order to fulfill the prophetic passage in Adriana's book. Gil is interrupted by Inez and her parents, who have returned to the hotel room after the father has some kind of heart scare.  Gil's machinations, attempting to prevent Inez from discovering that he stole the earrings, don't cut it since he could have avoided the whole predicament by buying earrings for Adriana at a store the next day (and that's what predictably transpires!).Gil finally learns an important life lesson that living in the past is useless when he joins Adriana in traveling back to her golden age of the 1890s.  Back in the 20s, Hemingway speculates that Inez has been cheating on Gil, who confronts her when he returns to the present time.'Midnight in Paris' is watchable but I guarantee you'll forget about this film after a few days.  Please note that Lea Seydoux is sensational as Gabrielle, the bookseller babe that Owen Wilson walks off into the sunset with at film's end!",0,0,0,0

R15WG8IKI4SRTI,"You cannot expect too much after the disastrous Reloaded.  Hell, I'd go further to say that the entire franchise has entered the irrecoverable zone.  In truth, the Matrix series will not be remembered as one of those great trilogies.  Ahem, recent attempts in Star Wars!  It's a quite a shame too, since the first film was such a fiery triumph.  I thought it served as a harbinger of what future movie-making was going to be - bold magic.  However, after the release of Reloaded everything went tomblike and cold.  Now the mere reason to see Revolutions is for the absolute closure towards Neo once and for all.  And believe me that's the best thing that could ever happen.First off the beginning is a big yawn-inducing way to takeoff.  It's practically pointless, really.  I'm perplexed and bewildered as how  the Wachowski brothers could possibly come up with this.  They managed to grip us in the first one and at least Reloaded threw in an interesting catalyst.  Here, we have Neo stuck in a limbo between the Matrix and reality.  It takes place in a deserted train station, governed by the rules of the TRAIN MAN!  It becomes obvious that Neo is stuck within the TRAINMAN'S world when the bum smashes Neo into a wall.  Morpheus, Trinity, and the Oracle's bodyguard spring into prompt action to persuade the FRENCHMAN! to free Neo.  They quickly succeed and we thankfully never see the TRAIN MAIN AND FRENCHMAN again!  Which brings up the question, why were we introduced to them in the first place?  I can't comprehend why, but maybe its because I can't pen up anything as *snicker* good *snicker* as this?Once a captivating plot turns into a mishmash of using the One concept to thwart the nasty baddies.  Like when Neo and Trinity were cruising on their hovercraft and met a fleet of octopi sentinels.  Since we already knew that Neo has the power to destroy them with a wave of a hand (Reloaded), a number of scenes become dryly predictable.  I recall when the Wachowski brothers received an MTV award for the first Matrix film.  They said if we liked the first one then we're going to love the second one.  I`m smirking right now and  I`ll just leave it at that.Dialogue and characters are a movie's backbone.  Mishandle the two and your on a crash collision into a fiasco.  Revolutions falls face-first and hard.  The dialogue lacks appeal and substance.  I was sorely reminded of Episode II and realized both movies have so much in common.  I'm thinking Lucas and the Wachowskis must've gotten together during the development.  It has to be the reason, it just has to be!  Since the dialogue feels so wooly and pokerfaced whereas the first film  had a charismatic Oracle.  Not to mention Agent Smith's chilly viewpoint in how the human race is a virus and the machines are the cure.We don't even sense that the humans are fighting against total extinction.  Why?  Because we don't give a damn what happens to the cast.  All I notice is the dire need to generate excessive amounts of battles that aren't even worth bragging about.  It's a bad thing when the audience, like myself, begin to want to see the destruction of  Zion and have the bad guys triumph.  There are a number of characters onscreen  and like the TRAIN MAN, I question their appearances.  I thought of a sarcastic whoopee when Niobe showcased her talent to maneuver the ship in ""impossible"" ways.  Then I laughed at the dialogue of a captain verbalizing how astounded he was.  This has to be a spoof of how Sci-Fi movies aren't supposed to done.  It just has to be!  Which leads me to the question when is the REAL Matrix follow-ups coming?  Face it, if you compared Reloaded and Revolutions to the first one, you'll practically substantiate their apparent discrepancies.Last thing I'll discuss are the major fight scenes.  Are we, the audience, really in need to see visual splendor?  Because that's all I'm sensing from the Matrix and Star Wars.  Style unseating substance.  End this nonsensical trend.  Graphically driving the movie does not spell out memorable scenes.  The standoff against sentinels and human mechs definitely looks more wacky than anything.  Suspense was at a low point during the otherwise climatic fight.  It feels out of place and dull.  Its hard to believe that millions of dollars were blown on the very mediocre battles.  And where did the martial arts run off to?  The excess of clanking robots blasting endless streams of firepower on the sentinels felt like a distraught imagination.  Since the machines drilled a hole to Zion why didn't they lob their explosives like they did in Reloaded?  As for the one-on-one clash with Neo and Smith, it superfluously mirrors something out of the cartoon Dragon Ball Z.  I scoff at this and scoff it some more!Sci-Fi has never felt ridiculously fictitious or futile.  Thanks a lot Revolutions.  I'm a fantasy junkie and you now make me seem like one of those fanboys who root for the impassive Neo and the cliché of style over substance.  Yet, hope enkindles!  There will be an emotional intimacy that will be in the next Lord of The Rings film!  Luckily everything that has a beginning has an ending, and with it goes the Matrix.",0,0,0,0

R2YB82B0CP3NHP,"This book was a gift that I have had for a while. I am finally getting around to reviewing it.First, I had extremely high hopes for this cookbook, as I often enjoy the recipes on the show. This book is filled with gorgeous pictures... of the chefs! Where are the photos of the food? I cannot stand this. Show me a picture of what the food looks like.Next, the layout of the book is completely illogical. Every section has meats, side dishes, drinks and crafts. I couldn't get my bearings on where everything is located.One of the recipes has some type of error. On page 23 a Kielbasa and Bean Stew has no beans. I'm not sure if it is missing beans or if the title was supposed to be Kielbasa and Beer Stew. I must admit that I didn't try the recipe. It just seemed too greasy for my taste.I love the Oz Family Fried Rice. Fried Rice is one of my go-to meals. I love that the recipe includes fresh ginger. It's my secret ingredient as well. Thai chopped Chicken salad was fast and yummy as well. The Chilled Tomato and Bread Soup was okay. The Apple Brown Betty and Grilled Peaches with Rosemary are two more good recipes with minimal ingredients. I also liked the Bacon Pancakes with Maple Bourbon Butter. I will tell you it is just as amazing as it sounds.You need to be a pretty good chef to make many of these dishes. Many of them include pizza dough or biscuits that you make from scratch. These are not Rachel Ray 30 minute meals. Some have way too many ingredients. Swamp thing is a twist on shrimp grits that now has 23 ingredients and has 20 minutes prep time and 30 minutes cook time.There are a few drink recipes that are included, but none of them were my kind of drinks, so what I would normally consider my favorite part was more ""eh"".In the end, I got about 5 good recipes out of this, which to me isn't the best cost-wise and definitely isn't a good investment space-wise.  This is one that I would check out at the library before deciding if it's your kind of cookbook. Overall, I was left underwhelmed.",0,0,0,0
R3SDM6XKZX2T39,"Of course I belonged to the throngs that bought the book without reading a review. I wouldn't be a nimrod, and life wouldn't be ironic if I didn't. My first compulsion was to regret the act, but now I'm looking at it as a learning experience. You know, like a list of things of what NOT to do.Unless a book is truly horrible, I usually stick through till the end, and while I can't entirely say that this book is utter rubbish, I believe that it comes dangerously close to being so. Like many other reviewers said here, I find that the prose/plot/settings of Paolini's work was painfully similar to Star Wars: A New Hope and Tolkien's Middle Earth. Now that hit a nerve. But I was trying to be understanding and pushed my annoyance onto the backburner; because a lot of fantasy works out there are obviously going to carry fragments of some of their classic predecessors - there's even a postmodern term for it, and it's called ""intertextuality"".To quote one of my old college professors: ""we don't so much ""write"" discourse as that we ""are written by"" the discourses we attempt to create: i.e, there are strongly entrenched models, tropes, conventions, etc. that govern the possibilities of how we will write.""So to a certain extent, as a reader (and dabbling writer), I can be forgiving of this. However, while all writers will more or less follow the footprints that greater authors before them have laid out, all I ask is that each footprint left behind be distinctive from the older markings. In other words, by all means, observe, appreciate and learn from these texts. But for heaven's sake, please make it your own. Paolini, however, doesn't see it that same way. Though I will grant him certain flashes of originality, such as the creation of that werecat creature and the Twins in the book, I don't think these characters are enough to overshadow his derivative writing. At one point I even believed that Saphira at least would be Paolini's saving grace, but he dashed my hopes there too.And as for the protagonist, Eragon, towards the end of the book I was hoping that he would be done away with and that someone else, someone more interesting, would rise up from the ashes to take his place. No luck there. 2-dimensional is not the word. I searched and searched for ways by which I could empathize with him, but I think my empathy well had dried up. And by the time that I was halfway through, his fainting spells were so much of a common occurrence that I wanted to dress him up in a pink outfit and get him cast in a Disney princess story. But wait, I don't think that even Sleeping Beauty or Snow White were in such dire need of the smelling salts. In comparison to Eragon, they'd probably have fared better too.As for Brom - I sometimes suspect that he was written in to play the convenient character. You know, the bloke that seems to know everything, be in the right place at the right time, and has the goods and resources to train the budding hero. There was obviously little effort made to garner some connection here between character and reader. Only Brom's grumpiness carried across as real. Saphira started out a promising creature, but she too seemed to become one of Eragon's many tools of convenience. And Arya? Girl, you have my sympathies. It's clear that Eragon/Paolini has got you perched on his mantle now; all poised and pretty. Oh, and love-interest-y too. The poor thing. The descriptions of her all centered around grace, beauty, and er...beauty again. I wouldn't mind so much if he didn't overdo it. She has slanted brows, cat-shaped eyes, is fair-of-face, exotic, and when she speaks, it appears that her words lie on the edge of a song. So you mean she's gonna break out into a song now? Kinda like the stuff they do on broadway or on London's West End. Yeah, that must be it. This must be some kind of musical-parody piece.Well, to save myself - and you poor readers - from my further rants, I'll stop here. I did want to expand on his writing a la thesaurus (that's obviously become his crutch now - and some kind of peculiar instrument to demonstrate his superiority with words), but I won't. I'll just say that oftentimes, simple really does work. And grandeur can be quite off-putting.I won't quite say that you should avoid this book at all costs, but if you're planning on buying it with your hard-earned money, I really hope you don't do that. If you can borrow it, it's a good demonstration of bad. Of what to avoid when you're constructing your own works.",0,0,0,0

R5JJ74XRAXX5S,"I started this diet having lost 47 pounds in the past 5 months through eating clean and organically while restricting calories to a reasonable amount, and exercising 60-90 minutes/5-6 days a week. In these past 5 months, I have allowed myself little ""treats"" of organic chocolate and the like every now and again, and still was pleased with the weight loss I accomplished.I had high hopes for the FMD because it appeared to be eating many of the same foods I had been, but just in different ""phases"". I should have known all the nonsense talk in the book of ""repairing my metabolism"" was too good to be true. At the end of 5 days on FMD, I had gained 4 pounds, so I stopped FMD immediately. On days 1 and 2, I felt good and the diet was easy to stick to. Days 3 and 4 were nothing short of hell. Although high protein and veggies are part of my typical diet, the sheer quantities prescribed by FMD made me feel horrible. It was difficult to eat that much, as it was literally too much food for my adjusted eating habits. It was also difficult feeling like I had no energy because of eating almost no carbs. I decided to stick out those days. But, lo and behold, day 5 was even worse than days 3 and 4. Having had such severe restrictions, I went crazy on day 5 and couldn't eat enough junk food. Things I ordinarily have no issues staying away from were irresistible to me- cake, large portions of chocolate, etc. I couldn't stop. I believe that my body felt so depleted, it prompted me to eat carbs like crazy. Or else, I have no willpower, but I believe that the weight loss I've accomplished in the past few months debunks that theory. Towards the end of day 5, I made a conscious decision to END the FMD. On day 6, I weighed myself and was 4 pounds heavier than prior to starting this diet, so it's over for me. The book is getting returned ASAP.I've since looked into the author's credentials, and find it quite interesting that it's extremely difficult to find reference to actual degrees earned. She talks in the book about having studied animal science. In general, I rate her credentials a big old TWO QUACKS UP.I have PCOS, and am on medication for that, so I do not believe that having that metabolic disorder should affect the results of the diet, but there's always a chance that it did. Regardless, I've now learned the hard way that FMD IS NOT THE DIET FOR ME! I'm going back to what worked for the last 5 months- just eating healthy, organic foods in controlled portions and literally exercising my butt off. Sometimes the simplest solution really is the best!",0,0,0,0

R22QCUPTVX9ZUK,"I guess this is what passes for academic history these days, where people are mere pawns of inexorable social phenomena. But what's most interesting about any history are the human dramas. South African history is littered with fascinating personalities and dramatic events. Van Riebeeck, Chaka, Dingane, Smith, Mlanjeni, Retief, Maritz, Jameson, Rhodes, Botha, the list of interesting personalities is endless. But they and the events they caused or experienced are but a vague background in this wordy tome. The people who drove events are ghosts rating a word or a paragraph, with no personality at all. The climactic battle of Blood River merits less than a paragraph (it's not even listed in the index). The author mentions a few people (Cecil Rhodes arrives in Africa and in a paragraph he's suddenly Prime Minister) and an event or two, then launches into yet another lengthy discussion of racial and class divisions.  The fraught racial and social context are by no means a mystery to anyone even remotely familiar with South Africa, but they are endlessly elaborated and repeated here, consuming at least a third of the text. After the the 5th repetition, let alone the 23rd, I got the point. Those issues are critical to understanding South Africa, but jeez, gimme a break, will ya? In the end, the author makes the fascinating, convoluted history of a storied nation simply . . . boring. I was sorely disappointed. Now searching for something better.",0,0,0,0

I thought it didn't need 2 Triple H matches on there as that wasn't the greatest feud. I think Cena vs Lesnar Extreme Rules needed to be included as well as Taker vs Lesnar at Summerslam though he lost though matches those were some of his biggest matches in the time period. Biggest Summerslam ever along with his return at Extreme Rules. Even Cena vs Lesnar Night Of Champions could be on there or him vs Big Show, Mark Henry.  The matches that are good Mania 30 vs Taker Slam 13 vs Cm Punk. Seth Rollins vs Lesnar would have better if there was a winner and Taker didn't interfere. Lesnar vs Angle is good at Slam 03. Hell in a Cell 15 is good vs Taker but I would have included Summerslam 15.  Overall this is a good enough set to be a must buy. Brock Lesnar is the biggest star in wrestling now and biggest draw.

R1CZ2D6D8HHHYC,"Last winter... I checked Eragon out from the library. About 50 or some pages in, I finally closed the book, put it down, and returned it to the library.Just as a baseline, here are some fantasy-ish books I read: Rowling, Tolkien, McCaffrey, Diana Wynne Jones, Lloyd Alexander.... some Tamora Pierce, Lawrence Watt-Evans, a little Terry Pratchett.... Roald Dahl, Bruce Coville, Arthur C. Clarke (ok, sci-fi)...So. Eragon. It... wasn't that good. The first few pages almost made me retch with its awful inexperienced writing. Some sort of big scary troll things were being described; or rather, the writer was doing his very best to describe how scary they were.Quite honestly, the writing was right out of some ill-written amature fanfic (although the spelling was better). But I decided to give the book a chance, and plowed on. I mean, I've read many online fanfics; good fanfics, very well written fanfics, and a bunch of bad fanfics. I'm used to all sorts of writing, and I know some fanfics can get unexpectedly better as they continue.Anyway, the book Eragon. I dragged my way through the first few pages... then, I think it got kind of interesting... I don't remember too well... Mainly I remember how grating the writing was. Reading Eragon was like trying to chew on sand-sprinkled spinach. Besides the pure writing style, a lot of other reasons have been covered already; ie, too much of Eragon came from somewhere else. For instance, the relationship described between the boy and the dragon -- the very word structure, I swear, could've been lifted out of McCaffrey's Dragonrider books.And for some reason, I was supposed to think that blue dragon was wonderful. Well, that dragon was blah, I didn't get that dragon's personality, I couldn't figure out if that dragon had a coherent personality at all, and I couldn't understand why the protagonist fellah Eragon or whoever was so smitten by the dragon. I wasn't connecting to this Eragon world at all. I finally gave up reading the book.(Since I got turned away too early, I won't try to review the plot.)I hear a movie is being made of this book. That just gives me the chills. But... Then again, there are a number of very nice movies based on awful books. We'll see.So like I mentioned in the review's title.

R3VM6QPE17XR9M,"I'd heard so much hype about this book and its sequels that I finally decided to give it a go. I won't say that I'm disappointed, exactly, but it definitely doesn't live up to the publicity.Yes, a seventeen year old wrote it and while that's admirable, it most definitely reads like the work of a teenager, derivative and unoriginal. It's rehash of so many other fantasy novels out there, all the clichés are present and accounted for: poor orphan finds magical bauble, magical doohickey forces orphan out of his/her little world and into the Big Wide Dangerous World, some ancient evil force (AEF) is reawakening, said AEF sees orphan as threat and goes after him/her, orphan discovers s/he has far bigger destiny and powers than previously expected. It's routine, and in this book, so many times it's also boring.The only thing that saved this from a one star rating is 1) me happening to like those clichés and 2) Eragon is actually interesting the more his eyes are opened to the world around him. He still acts the annoying, dumb, two dimensional hick enough to make me roll my eyes, but by the end of the book he's definitely growing as a character.",0,0,0,0

The first part of this collection is entirely skippable with a series of vapid conversations which, presumably, have a point. This point was entirely inscrutable to me. It wasn’t even pointless enough to make one ponder the pointlessness of such conversations. It just failed to make any impact at all. In a way, I suppose, this is a certain niche type of literary achievement. Not an achievement which I enjoyed whatsoever. The collection trended in the slightly more interesting as it progressed, but there is not a single story that proved easily scrutable or compelling.F",0,0,0,0

R30TUSITIUN44C,"The description of this book caught my eye and I was excited to dive into the story.  However, I did not find the story to be exciting. The book’s cover states that more than 500,000 books of the series are in print, and although I’m sure plenty of people enjoyed it, I, however wasn’t one of them.I made my way through about a quarter of the book, but it really dragged for me, often repeating the same things.  Alcorn’s writing style is in depth and very visual. The topic is interesting and perhaps I will go back and try reading it again in a few months.As I read the beginning of the book - it’s about three guys Jake, Doc and Finney. Best friends since childhood, that have watched their families grow up and spend football games together every week. One afternoon their lives are abruptly torn apart in a car accident, that leaves two dead and one wondering what really happened. Jake, left alive to sift through the mystery surrounding their deaths, begins to learn more about his best friends than he ever did.  When Doc dies, we get a front row seat of his experiences in hell, and when Finney arrives in heaven, we also get to make the journey with him.  Jake is left sorting through his own life and wondering about his very salvation.I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review.

R1M3X1HKA5U4OM,"This is a copy/paste from my Goodreads.com review. Please see some of my other reviews too!First, watch the movie before you read this book. In attempting to picture Hawkeye, can't go wrong with Daniel Day-Lewis. Cooper's flowery narrative and awful dialogue is hard enough for any good reader to wade through. Nevertheless, this is still an important book to read. The character of Hawkeye is one of the earliest incarnations of such heroes as Daniel Boone and The Lone Ranger. The only reason I found to keep turning pages was the anticipation of Hawkeye always arriving in the nick of time with his trusty Red Ryder to save the day. He is the most developed character in the book.There's also unintentional comedy with the character of David Gamut who was written out of the movie because the man can't ride a horse to save his life. Hawkeye frequently comments on his desire to take the psalmists pitch pipe and shove it down his throat. By the last half of the book I was starting to wish someone would put the poor man out of his misery.The two female characters are the second reason to read the book. If you've seen the movie, be prepared to be disappointed. No hanky panky for Hawkeye, he has respect for the ""gentle sex"" but he's asexual. Alice gets more action with her love interest. Magua, the bad guy, comes off as the coolest character in the book. He'll have Cora to do his wigwam cooking and gardening or die trying. The Indians show such distain for women, the greatest insult they can think of is calling another man a weak female. I suspect feminists aren't protesting against the reading of this book because you can't fight a classic.As classics go, this is not a stand out. I got more out of the Cliff's Notes.",0,0,0,0

R1AJ810CX99APW,"Wow,  I read this book and my first thought was, ""Wow, is this guy serious?"" Ninety-five percent of this book(minimum) is a cheap knockoff off LoTR, Dune, Star Wars,and the Belgariad. I've read some peoples arguements that the plot is just the typical epic fantasy plot, and yes, that is correct. It is very similair to how Joseph Campbell explains it, and I have no problems with epic fantasies having a rather repetitive plot line. What I absolutely disagree with is the blatant plagarism of names, specifics, and dialogues. The one that I remember the most, is the exchange at a river, where upon crossing the river, Bron had stolen the money back from the guard character. Now if a person had read ""Pawn of Prophecy"" by David Eddings they might think, ""well, golly gee, that sounds really familiar."" And that would be because the exact same exchange goes on, almost to the word. And oh, by the way, Pawn of Prophecy(1982) was written before CP was a twinkle in his fathers eye.  Now even if one can look past the ""ahem"" similairities between this book and others, the authors writing style leaves much to be desired. It is obviously written at the average fifteen year olds writing level, I half expected poorly drawn crayon dragons in the margin. CP avoids the use of ""said"" like the plague, and ends every chapter like a 90's dungeons and dragons game-Eragon falls asleep/gets knocked out/passes out ad nauseum.  I'm hoping at this point(if one makes it this far) that a person might ask, ""well, golly, if CP is such a terrible author, where did all these here five star ratings come from?"" While I do not know for sure, I would hypothesize that these ratings came from younger readers who have not yet read the full scope of fantasy/epic fantasy out there. I sure hope this one doesn't scare them away.  In conclusion I found this book to be dry, severely irritating(due to the ""similarities""), and all an all a waste of space on a bookshelf. So do everyone a favor and don't support this author, read some Eddings, Jordan, Martin, Herbert(sci fi), Hobb, Weiss and Hickman, or any of the other truely original, fantasy authors.",0,0,1,1

R3BCHMWZS1QL1G,"Seriously, just say the title to yourself. Slowly--one word at a time. Go ahead, no one's watching. Snakes...on...a...plane. Can you do that without laughing? I know I can't.What started out as an EXPLOSIVE internet phenomenon in spring 2006 became a legend by August. And unless you've been living under a rock for the last year and a half, you'll definitely know something about Snakes On A Plane. When the story surfaced, I thought it was such a genius idea for a brainless summer popcorn movie, became a regular on the IMDb board for a bit, got an official T-Shirt at Hot Topic, and, unfortunately, didn't get a chance to see it when it opened on August 18th. Well, last night I sat down with a friend at 1:30 in the morning with a can of Rockstar, popcorn, and french fries and put the movie on, truly, completely not knowing of what was about to be thrown in my face.As you can probably imagine, Snakes on a Plane is about...well...snakes on a plane. A teenager witnesses a brutal murder in Honolulu, doesn't do anything, and Samuel L. Jackson as a super-cool FBI agent must escort him to LA to testify. But the murderer wants this witness dead--so he releases deadly snakes on the plane to make sure he dies.The film is basically made up of people getting killed in the most random and outrageous ways imaginable by this ASTOUNDINGLY unrealistic movie, and Samuel L. Jackson killing the snakes and trying to protect the passengers. Hilarity ensues--I laughed throughout the whole movie. The dialogue is absolutely ridiculous, badly written, super-corny, yet excruciatingly funny. Kenan Thompson portrays a video-game addict passenger who attempts to fly the plane and the whole thing is just really, really funny.Aside from that, being honest--S.O.A.P is without a doubt the WORST movie I have ever seen. Ever. It has no story, it's extremely corny (even the scenes without the snakes), makes you want to kill yourself, it's terribly acted, and everything else bad you can think of. Yet, there's a little voice inside you protesting, insisting you watch the rest of Samuel L. Jackson beating the crap out of poisonous snakes. While it is the worst movie I've ever seen--I ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT. I know this is an over-used, worn-out expression, but this is really the only film I've ever seen where it 100% applies--Snakes on a Plane is SO bad, it's good. It makes for a fantastic laugh and it's a healthier alternative to drugs to forget all your problems and worries and just enjoy a night of watching snakes kill people on a plane. Overall, the ULTIMATE summer party movie. It's original as hell, side-splittingly funny, and 100% awesome--yet it's also the worst film ever produced.The only problem is, I have no idea whether I give this movie 5 stars or 0 stars. So I've decided on half and half--a 2 1/2.Just see this movie. SOAP will undoubtedly go down in history as a cult classic.",0,0,0,0

RMZQHXGRSO4SR,"To movie lovers everywhere, I apologize for giving Billy Jack one star -- zero stars was not an option on the review form. This cheaply made flick gets my vote for the all-time worst! A Native-American tribal cop, skilled in martial arts, goes around beating the crud out of people -- even killing. Why? Because he believes in peace! Supposedly, he's defending people against local bigots -- no problem there. But instead, he focuses on defending a liberal school's touchy-feely values. This goofball school makes the best argument yet against the voucher system. Why study math when we can all take mime lessons in order to express ourselves better? I believe in diversity, but here it's used more as a superficial plot device than in any meaningful way. (I use the word ""plot"" VERY loosely.) Eerily, one suspects that ""schools"" such as this thrive in places like Boulder and Sedona. The female lead -- Laughlin's homely, off-screen wife -- can't act and looks 20 years older than the star. OK, I know it shouldn't matter that she's ugly, but the point is that she and Laughlin are poorly matched on-screen. The moronic ending features Billy Jack being led away by the police between lines of zit-faced teenyboppers -- fists raised in the archaic ""power"" symbol -- while the over-ripe song ""One Tin Soldier"" plays in the background. Moral: 13-year-old girls are wiser than the rest of us, and violence is OK, as long as you support a liberal political and educational agenda.

R18BB4GRA6TF0R,"The title of this book is a fraud: Although there are environments and professions where introverts _thrive_ and various of their traits are _advantageous_ if not essential, the book barely acknowledges this.  And the occasional statements about the benefits of some of the characteristics of introverts and the you-are-ok reassurances come across as insincere and condescending because they are surrounded and vastly outweighed by admonitions that introverts must change and become more like extroverts or that they must accept that they just can't keep up.I picked up this book because it was favorably mentioned in discussions of a recent study of corporate management that found that contrary to assumptions that leaders are extroverts, that a mix of extroverts and introverts had decided advantages and that an introvert could be a successful CEO with close associates who were extroverts to complement (balance) him.I am a scientist/engineer and work in an introvert-rich environment.  Yet these people are not represented in this book--their existence is barely acknowledged. Although the author acknowledges that there is a range of introverts, she seems to be heavily focused only on the extremes, especially those who are easily overwhelmed by the normal course of everyday events. While this distortion may be a bias induced by whom the author sees as a therapist, it is a major factor in my hostility to this book.  Because the author cites various famous introverts who don't match this characterization, she should be aware of this skew.The book is riddled with contradictions between how it characterizes introverts and the writing.  The book characterizes introverts as focused and attentive, yet incessantly repeats the same few basic high-level points.  Introverts are self-aware and analytical, but the book assumes that they are oblivious and provides obvious banalities (Overwhelmed by events? Try pacing yourself.) Introverts like careful, deep analysis, but the book provides facile, shallow descriptions. Introverts are inner-directed and not motivated by groups, but the ""motivation"" is to present a list of successful introverts and say that that you can do it too.  This is the sort of cheerleading that introverts roll their eyes at.Although the author claims to be an introvert, I saw nothing in the book that would indicate such and came to the belief that the claim was simply a ploy employed by therapists to establish empathy, or possibly credibility. The anecdotes that she tells of herself don't feel authentic, but more like a story fashioned to make a point. Neither did I encounter any real understanding or empathy for introverts. The approach of this book is that of an extrovert--just do it--rather than an introvert who wants a deeper understanding to guide a plan of action.  In many places, the book felt as if textbook-derived understanding of introversion had been applied to a generic template for self-help books.Note: This is not an assessment of what the author is or isn't, but of what came through in the book--this is a review of the book, not the author.--- Additional---I read an interesting essay ""Is Shyness an Evolutionary Tactic?"" by Susan Cain in the 25 June 2011 New York Times.

R1AYYH2XJBA06F,"If you are a fan of any of the genres and sub genres of sci-fi this is one to avoid. Seriously - read the other one * reviews to get an overview of what a load of tosh this is. I read nine chapters so I gave it a fair crack and even at that it was jam-packed with spurious detail about characters, creatures and hybrids that just fogged up whatever this was supposed to be. The central concept and subsequent storyline are so contrived as to leave the reader wondering after each (short) reading whether to waste any more time reading on in case anything lucid or interesting might happen. I strongly suspect it doesn't. I bought this secondhand and grudge the few quid it cost. Avoid and read top sci-fi guys (like Bob Shaw - sadly deceased) who can create beautiful worlds and believeable technologies whilst still peopling their stories with characters who are clearly and strongly drawn and about whom you want to find out more - you want to feel engaged by them for God's sake !",0,0,0,0
R1AW6865RJQ57Q,"First off, I'm pretty familiar with the Shockey family and with hunting in general.  Having seen that Eva was writing a book, I was really looking forward to it.  Along with all of the hype on social media, I was expecting the book was going to be really good. I just finished the audio book today and I wasn't impressed.  While some of the family's and Eva's history was interesting, I felt the rest of the book was a let down.  I wasn't a big fan how Eva really dumbed down hunting (which is fine for those who aren't familiar with it) in explaining some of the simplest things about it.  I feel like most of her audience already knows these basic things about hunting and conservation so the least she could have done is talk to her audience as if they were knowledgeable on the subjects. I personally would not recommend the book to another person and I would also not pay much attention to all of the reviews by her ""launch team"".",1,1,0,1

Just pull the tape out about 8 inches and use the cut blade on the dispenser to cut the tape. Throw that 8 inches of tape in the garbage. Now you can begin using the double sided tape.

R1BR5NI6PSVUQF,"Returned it. Everything about the chair was great (nice look, matched my desk color, sturdy wood and caster wheels), but the arm holes were drilled in the wrong spot on each side. It was impossible to attach the arms to both the chair's back and the seat portion together. Had to choose one or the other--which is a fatal flaw because the stability of the back rest is mostly supported by the bolted arms. The worst part was that I noticed marks on the chair that showed I wasn't the first to encounter this problem. They sent me a chair that was already returned for the problems I listed above, which is a little insulting. Do not buy this chair as is. I've seen similar reviews mentioning the same issue.

It was some of the most graphic violence I've ever been exposed to; even my husband (who is immune to such things in general) was caught squirming in his seat at times.  I originally bought this book because of the good reviews.  I'd read that it was 'non-stop action' and this is true but seriously, I feel that the plot was weak and completely unbelievable.

Cannot fault Amazon customer service, they gave me a refund. I have exchanged it for a roller ball of the same design and that is working fine. I had to place a new order as its not possible to exchange a fountain pen for a rollerball (not like for like I presume). The design of the pen is what compelled me to replace it with a rollerball , its beautifully chiselled and gunmetal finish is stunning.

R1C44HAENKR8JT,"Let's face facts - the fifties were a horribly stifling time for women and had this movie not portrayed them as so, it would have been a distortion of truth.  Elite New England universities were notoriously conservative and the importance of 'clean' appearances was strictly enforced. A character such as Katharine, the rebellious art history professor would have made herself a mark for challenging the values of said establishment, no matter how beloved she was by her fellow students.The reason I gave this film only two stars was that it constantly second guessed itself.  Towards the beginning of the film, Katharine refuses faculty housing because she refuses to live in a place where she cannot have male visitors.  Later on, when she's rented a room somewhere else, the same restriction applies.  She pushes Joan (by incorrectly assuming she would want to have both career and family) into applying for Yale and when Joan choses to get married, gets properly called out for wanting others to do as she says, not as they would.Also, when was the influence of Katharine over Betty taking place? As far as I could tell, they couldn't stand each other.  Personally I think Betty was being correctly advised by Giselle, the one character who did seemed human and fallible.  Even though she was intelligent and well-spoken, the fact Giselle was free thinking and sexually active almost set her up for the inevitable ""slut self destructs"" storyline. I'm glad they nicked that in the bud, as the scene in the dorm room after Giselle catches Betty's no-good husband Spenser in New York showed.  Giselle passed up the opportunity to shatter Betty publicly to instead be a good friend to her.  Had this movie possessed more moments like this, it would have been well-balanced and more enjoyable.One good thing that comes from the fifties/early sixties period movies that have been made in the past few years (Pleasantville, Far From Heaven and Down with Love) is that it finally establishes that those days are past us.  They are now only fit for nicely shot movies and pretty soundtrack recordings.",0,0,0,0
R2UOSC3SQRWWJC,"Sure, Eragon is a real page-turner. However, you can't but help notice some cliche that's been put in the story. Eragon and Saphira acted childish and foolish sometimes without us (the reader) being told or shown so. Also, Paolini could have improved his method of characterization throughout the story. He could have made Jeod into a more round character because he would become important later, but we really didn't get to know him, only that he is part of the Varden. This is not overanalyzing the story but rather just looking at where Paolini could have improved. You can't help but see this. I am surprised that Knopf published the book without catching these errors, even more so because the book was to be marketed to teens and older children. On the other hand, Eragon is a great book, especially since it was written by a 15-year old, not 17. The marketing of the book did not make it popular; many books have been advertised a lot and still turn out to be flops. What made this book popular was that it was a book that could not be put down. Nobody buys the second book (Eldest) unless he or she liked the first, so nobody can say the book is popular because of marketing. People like it because it's a good thriller/ imagination stimulator. It's just not a book that you can stop. Eragon could have been better, but that doesn't make me think that it's the worst book in the world like some other reviewers have pointed out.The major conflict that plays into the climax isn't introduced until about halfway through the book. By then your thinking that the conflict and the climax will be dealing with the Ra'zac, but no. I'm not telling who, but a new character is introduced halfway in the story and the entire story takes a left turn from there. If you've already read both Eragon and Eldest, then you know that the Ra'zac conflict will continue in Eldest, but no clues in Eragon give that away.One more point I'd like to make is in retaliation to another review written recently. What teenager wouldn't want to be published if given the chance? He or she would have a voice in the world, something few teenagers and young adults have. Being successful may be a matter of opinion, but I just don't buy the fact that not all teenagers want to be published. Getting published is the same thing as saying that your writing stands out above most other writings in the nation. You are now a nationally known celebrity. What teenager wouldn't want that?One more thing is that you have all these reviewers giving Eragon 5 stars when all they say is that its a really great book. Can anyone explain WHY it's a really great book? (Not just that it's a page-turner)The movie Eragon is set to release in July 2006. It would probably do better there.",0,0,0,0

R2ZDQXALRG491H,"I haven't seen ""Brokeback Mountain,"" the much ballyhooed front runner for the best picture Oscar that, in the end, had to content itself with honors in three lesser categories (as well as best picture honors from just about every other organization that hands out such trophies), so I can't contribute to the debate that continues to rage, fueled by those who think Ang Lee's drama was robbed by ""Crash.""But having finally seen ""Crash"" in a copy loaned from my local public library, I can certainly understand why the controversy is so emotionally heated.""Crash"" STINKS!Let the dishonest ""no helpful"" votes begin (dishonest because they usually come from people who already saw and/or own this movie and are rating reviews based on whether or not they agree with them, not on whether or not the review was truly helpful).The most prominent champion of ""Crash"" was Roger Ebert (and his less prominent TV co-host) who admitted in his review of ""The Dukes of Hazzard"" that he wasn't familiar with the TV show on which it was based because he wasn't watching television much in the 70s when it was popular. Well, if Roger hadn't been so busy seeing movies, or, more likely the case, wasn't such a TV snob (as many ""film critics"" tend to be), he might have seen one of the seemingly endless number of made for TV movies from that decade that ""Crash"" resembles. Most were 90 minute ripoffs of theatrical films, and a fair number of them were produced by Aaron Spelling for ABC's Movie of the Week.Some had their feet planted squarely in the ""disaster"" genre so popular at the time in which assorted stereotypes are thrown together in a moment of crisis, argue about race and other matters few people are likely to think about when (A) trapped in a subway; (B) trapped on a hijacked plane; (C) trapped in an elevator in a burning building, etc, etc. There was always a street wise black guy in a Superfly outfit that few blacks would have been caught dead in; the Jewish character, usually a delicatessen owner, who spouts various cliched homilies; a Puerto Rican with a pregnant wife; a homosexual (limp-wristed variety), etc, all in opposition to each other until the heartwarming finale when their nearly fatal experience has drawn them together, enabling them to understand that, you know, black people are pretty much like white folk, and Puerto Ricans and Jewish delicatessen owners are, well, you know, no different than the blacks who, as already noted, are no different from the whites, etc, etc, etc.""Crash"" is marginally better because it doesn't trap its cardboard characters in a plane about to dive into the ocean, or on a cruise ship overturned by a tidal wave, or in a 20 car pileup on a busy highway, but it's still the kind of hackneyed attempt at serious filmmaking guaranteed to inspire snickers from those of us who know a little something about people and real life. Contrivance is a tool that every filmmaker uses, as does every story teller in any medium. When the story teller is truly gifted, the seams don't show. In ""Crash,"" those seams are dangling and coming apart in our faces, so obviously do the filmmakers hammer home their ""message,"" which has been delivered many times before, and more convincingly, too, whether it was in 1967's Oscar winning ""In the Heat of the Night,"" or an episode of the landmark 70s sitcom ""All in the Family.""The performances are all mediocre, but it's hard to fault the actors when they're spouting dialogue that sounds like it was cribbed from a newspaper's editorial pages, albeit with the addition of the F word that filmmmakers think ""real people"" use more frequently than they do. Cops may talk like that, and street punks may talk like that, but most Arab store owners, and most respectible people, do so only in the heat of passion. (Yeah, I know. EVERYONE in this movie is lost in the heat of passion, but not credibly so).Matt Dillon's facial expressions bring to mind the frequently deranged looking grin worn by Robert DeNiro in some of his lesser performances. And Dillon got an Oscar nomination for that??? Don Cheadle smokes cigarette after cigarette, as if he just doesn't know what to do with himself. Some of the other black actors get stuck with the worst, most unconvincing dialogue, deriding rap for perpetuating stereotypes on one hand, and taking offense that a white woman played by Sandra Bullock clutches her purse when they pass, even though these particular black characters are the kind who make clutching one's purse necessary.Other ""name"" (as opposed to ""star"") performers turn up throughout including Thandie Newton, Ryan Phillippe, Brendon Fraser, Jennifer Esposito, and Tony Danza. Tony Danza??? Yes, Tony Danza, the former sitcom actor turned talk show host, whose appearance in a small role serves no purpose other than to make the audience say, ""That's Tony Danza!""The music score may be the most pretentious aspect of ""Crash."" It's one of those New Agey things with an etheral vocal, the likes of which is being used too often in movies these days.It usually takes a little more time to digest the Academy's choices for best film and decide whether they made the right call or not, but not this year. The Academy blew it! ""Crash"" just may be the worst film ever to be named best picture of the year. Two big swollen thumbs down for this truly awful film.Brianna Lauren",1,1,0,1
R300F5PDCSKO11,"If you're going to buy this, check yourself first and make sure that  you're a confirmed, loyal fan of the original Dune series, because only  then might you find in it some redeeming features, namely the exposition of  some of Frank Herbert's original ideas. Apart from this, the book is trite  and childish; I felt (a) as though I were sifting through a Dr. Seuss book  to find nuggets of original intention and (b) that I could have dragged a  better version out of my arse - perhaps Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson  should consider ordering Frank Herbert's original notes such that they  follow a reasonably contiguous pattern and then publishing them ""as  is"". Gone, here, is the plot complexity and the atmosphere, but what's  missing most of all is the psychological angle which made all of Frank  Herbert's books so compelling. Buy this book for a 5-year-old so that he  can have some introduction to the concepts of the Dune series for when he's  old enough to understand it. Incidentally, the previous reviewer (Pyotr  Petrovich Bazarov) was incorrect about the axolotl tanks and the no-room:  the first Duncan ghola was presented to Paul quite early on, and the very  same no-room was rediscovered by Duncan Idaho's last incarnation in  ""Heretics of Dune"" some 10,000 years later, complete with  original Harkonnen images, nullentropy bins, etc. -- the novel is  consistent, for all its other faults.

R3419O61CXTIQ,"Having had a quick look through all the reviews for this film, it seems that there is a general consensus that it's a great film. Well, sorry to be the odd one out, but I found it immensely boring and pretentious. Yes, I  admit that the fight scenes are excellent, breathing new life into screen  combat. But what the hell is the story on about? It really wants to be a  philosophical allegory, including bits on religion and Alice In Wonderland  etc etc. It's not - it comes across some kind of weirdo's fantasy, all  blazing guns and S&M leather (just like Bound, the directors' previous  film). It really has no depth to it at all, but if you want a film to just  enjoy, then  suppose you could do worse than this. You'll just have to wade  through over an hour and a half until you get to anything good...but that's  what DVD can do, so in many ways it's a great film for the format. The  extras are copious and well put together, with the White Rabbit  feature  quite fun along with a great documentary on the filming of the bullet time  technology, all wrapped up in some snazzy menus (but the commentary is  quite tedious). The Matrix thinks it's clever, and spends half the film  trying to tell you this, which is the main reason I didn't like it. That,  and it's boring. Still, it has its moments.

R3AWPOQL1U1WR6,"This is so disappointing! It's so nice looking. As other reviewers mentioned, the back and drawer bottoms are not real wood, although they seem reasonably sturdy. However, the nails won't go through them. This is partly because the nails bend instantly; of the many included in the package, about half of them were unusable. I had to duct tape the backs of the drawers and the bottom back of the cabinet - in addition to adding pieces to the bottom because it wasn't long enough to meet the back. The pre-drilled holes are in the wrong places. It's hard to tell in this photo, but the bar in the middle that's supposed to be extra support is uneven, it tilts both vertically and diagonally, as in there's about an inch difference where each side sits from the side, and an inch difference measured from the floor as well. The drawers won't even go above and below it when it's in there. I'm not going to try to send it back, because it's more trouble than it's worth with such a large piece. But what a complete waste of money.",0,0,0,0

R8KOG71IZXCF2,"I bought this all-in-one with Amazon fulfillment of a NextGen order.  The unit I received may have been damaged: the box had at minimum been re-shipped several times.  Whatever the case, the device I received was deeply flawed and I had to return it.MAJOR PROBLEMS:This thing screams loudly while printing.  To say that it sounds like a cat is heat is insulting to cats, but the sound was a cross between that noise and your fire alarm going off.  Even after turning all the volume settings to ""off"" the screeching continued.  Not acceptable.Print quality is fair.  Note that this is an LCD printer, not a conventional laser printer, and it shows:  black print is OK but not saturated, and color print has a distinct grain, very much like photos reproduced in newspapers.  I ultimately bought the Canon MF8580 Cdw, which does a much better job of reproducing color print and photo images.DESIGN FLAWS/CONSIDERATIONS:Like all devices in this class, the Brother is heavy.  It can be muscled into place by one person, but hold out for a large person who enjoys the gym.The Brother will print envelopes and labels only using the straight-through feed, which necessitates dropping down the printer's back panel.  This isn't difficult in itself, but it does add another half-foot or so to the depth of the printer.  So don't believe the footprint dimensions stated on Amazon, and this may be an issue if you are trying to put the device on a standard desk or cubicle work surface.THE ONE REDEEMING GRACE:Amazon Prime was great about delivering on time and picking up the return from my home address, all with no additional charges.  If you are even vaguely considering ordering the Brother MFC9340CDW, go ahead and get Prime...it will pay for itself on the shipping and (I strongly suspect) eventual return of the item.THE BOTTOM LINE:If I could have granted zero stars,  I would have.  Save yourself some heartache (and backache) and steer clear of this one.",0,0,0,0

R2ZG6P79M4J29,"Well unlike some reviewers, I have never lost my sense of smell, and to me, this movie was quite the stinker.  Call me old-fashioned, but in order to enjoy a movie I must ""like"" the (at least one)characters or at least be able to relate to them. In ""Sideways"" we find a man who wallows in his own pity, a man who only wants to ""score"" one more time before he gets married despite the obvious costs... and oh yeah... a woman who is ""responsible"" enough to hide the joint she is smoking when her small son walks into the room.  Talk about a depressing cast of characters!  There is no one who I ""root"" for - they all seem like they are getting the miserable life that they deserve.  So why do some many people ""LOVE"" this movie? I will be the first to admit, that the acting is top-notch. The scenery was great - I truly felt transported to California wine country. So the movie almost seemed like a mini-vacation. However, those were really the only good points to the entire picture. I found the story either slow or at times even tedious. While I learned something about wine tasting -it isn't knowledge that I really needed (although I am positive some really enjoyed this aspect). In short, this movie reminds of what my friends say about beer (I am not a drinker) it is an acquired taste... and I think that is the perfect description of ""Sideways"" - a taste I defintely have not acquired.",0,0,0,0
R11BY14VORKQEV,"When I took the binder out the box, a loose screw fell out of who knows where - not a good sign.  The included instruction sheet was 100% in French.  The hole punch is very hard to operate; it is supposedly rated for 12 sheets, but I would not attempt more than 6 or 7 at a time (a lengthy task if you are binding a 150-page document).  Inserting the pages into the combs is also difficult and time-consuming.  (Vertical binders might work better, but I don't know this for a fact.)  This binder might be suitable for someone who needs to use a binder on rare occasions, but if that's the case then perhaps they don't really need to buy one.  The binder is designed for A4/21 hole paper, but it is adjustable to US letter size/19 holes with some trial and error.  The handle does NOT lock down for storage.

ROXD76T7TQ180,"Terribly hard to get to work with my Chromebook. Good instructions don't exist. Especially if you only have a Chromebook. Got lots of bad advice from Samsung tech support.  You have to use a PC or laptop but instructions don't directly tell you that. I don't have one. Samsung tech support eventually told me I could take the printer to someone who did have a PC and set it up there. They said to bring the printer back home and I would then be able to easily make it work on my wireless connection by changing the printer's address just using the Chromebook. That was totally wrong. You can't do that. Next Samsung tech support told me my Chromebook firewall was causing the problem and I should call the Chromebook manufacturer's tech support and have then fix that problem.  Wrong again! More hassle going down a blind alley. Finally, two tech savvy sons-in-law came over with a PC and, after two hours, got it working.  Basic problem is that understandable instructions do not exist anywhere...especially if you just have a Chromebook. The same problem might happen with any Cloud Ready printer you buy, I don't know. One thing I do know for a fact is that the Samsung tech support people I talked to really had no clue how to help me.  I called them at least three times and talked to a different person every time.

RIHBUA1W5MYV2,"I bought this printer in May 2015 and pretty much tolerated it for the first couple years. Yes, it would disconnect from wifi every once in awhile, and it was annoying to have to reinstall drivers to get it working again. But I got it cheap at a time when there were few affordably priced laser printers, so I considered it a trade-off. However, HP has now taken over and things have gone from mediocre to absolutely awful. It will no longer connect to wireless at all, even after I scoured the internet for the drivers (HP's customer service is non-existent, so don't bother asking for help). All of the documentation online is ancient. In fact, I was surprised to see that it is still for sale because I was sure it had been discontinued. I have no idea how they can sell a printer that no longer has online support or current drivers. Based on my experience, as well as the reviews here and elsewhere online, this model should be considered a wired laser printer that occasionally gives you the gift of wireless connectivity once a year.

RBZZUJTXBSP77,"The author has a wonderful witty mind - so many interesting, unusual, fun phrases and thoughts.  BUT... she needs to come up with a better reason to keep the couple apart.  The problem in both books 1 and 2 is:  The heroine desires the guy, loves the guy, misses him, and wants to be with him.  But for illogical reasons or fears she runs away, avoids him, and breaks up with him - even after having great sex.  Some will say this is a character's actions NOT fitting her motivations (violating a writing rule).  Others will say illogical silly heroine can be humorous.  But humor is in the eye of the beholder and this beholder wasn't there.  But I did chuckle and smile several times because the author has a fabulous mind.  But for much of the book I was annoyed and impatient.Most of the story has Janie insecure and afraid.  She is angsty in her conversations.  For almost every question Quinn asks, she takes a long time to answer.  She beats around the bush, changes the subject, answers other questions, and delays.  Another example, Janie does not want to have sex with Quinn if he is seeing other women, but she takes forever beating around the bush to say it, using ummmm's uhhhh's and vague metaphors.  A few times this happened with other characters.  Someone starts to say something I'm eager to hear, and then takes five minutes of distractions before saying it.  Maybe that works sometimes, but I did not like it here.OTHER BOOKS:I gave 2 stars to the first two books in the series.  This is book 1.  Book 2 is ""Friends Without Benefits.""I gave 5 stars to book 3 ""Love Hacked"" - those characters and actions were really good.AUDIOBOOK NARRATOR:Jennifer Grace did an excellent job with Janie, but she was a little off for Quinn.  I felt him differently than she did.DATA:Narrative mode: 1st person Janie.  Epilogue: 1st person Quinn.  Unabridged audiobook length: 14 hrs and 19 mins.  Swearing language: f*** and s*** about once each.  Sexual language: none, but the v-word used a couple times in other conversation.  Number of sex scenes: about 4, mostly behind closed doors.

REVZIKISIO9BA,"The product is okay, half the holes needed to put this thing together were not drilled out. The back doesn't match the rest of the item, the back of the item and the bottoms of the drawers have to be nailed in, but the nails are flimsy and the board is so thick it is borderline impossible to hammer through without injury. In fact,  I ended up using a nail gun. Assembly is unnecessarily difficult, and also doesn't make any sense. For example, why do I have to nail in the bottom composite board to the drawer when you went through the trouble of boring out a track to slide it in on 3 sides of the drawer, but not the back???Then, after all was said and done, AFTER it was assembled, I realized there is a huge scratch on the top.

R23NCQWLRR62A4,"I went into this movie with the hopes that I would like it. I wasn't sure about another actor playing Han Solo, but I was pleasantly surprised. He did an OK job portraying Han Solo. His acting wasn't great, but it wasn't terrible either. And I liked him.However, much of the movie was either confusing, boring, or both. Some parts, such as the final showdown with Crimson Dawn are exciting and fast-paced. But the majority of the movie felt very sluggish and low-stakes. We already know Han Solo survives because we see him in later movies. So the threat of him dying if he does not complete his ""mission"" falls flat. It doesn't create suspense or keep you on the edge of your seat. The plot felt contrived and forced. It didn't have much point, and nothing was really accomplished. The ""Rebellion"" gets some valuable fuel to help their cause. Han Solo meets Chewbacca and Lando and gets his ship. That's basically it. We didn't need a whole movie about that. It's just a backstory dump that doesn't have enough backstory. The characters weren't compelling enough and there weren't enough interesting elements to drive the very flimsy plot, so the whole movie just dragged.Qi'ra is an interesting character, but her unexplained motives make her fall flat as well. We don't really understand why she betrayed Han in the end and left him. Why did she kill her boss? Was it because she wanted to take over Crimson Dawn? Is she force sensitive and it was the dark side of the force was controlling her? Was she sick of being submissive, so she made sure that she became the one in power by taking over Crimson Dawn? Throughout the movie, people say she is a survivor. I think that's supposed to help explain why she killed her boss and left Han, but it doesn't do enough. We don't understand why she took over Crimson Dawn and went to help the dark side instead of leaving with Han. If she really loved him so much, then why did she not go with him? She would have been free. and she would have been her own woman. Han wouldn't have tied her down. Or did she think he would? Her thought process needs to be explained.And Han's reaction to her leaving doesn't seem strong enough. We're led to believe that he's madly in love with her. He worked for years to get back to her, to rescue her. So why, when she betrays him and leaves, does he just say ""Oh well"" and go get his ship? Why is he not more upset? Why does he not act more betrayed? I think the purpose of this movie is to show how Han Solo became the ""watch out for yourself and no one else"" guy we see in the original trilogy. The betrayals he experiences in the movie should help shape him into this person. But his reactions to these betrayals are minimal and unemotional, so they don't really do much to shape him as a character. And they definitely don't seem impactful enough to create the iconic character we see in the original trilogy.Qi'ra and Han's romance feels forced throughout the entire movie. It's cheesy in some parts, more lustful than loving in others, and all-around bad. Both characters are supposed to be super committed to each other, but neither feels committed at all. They have no chemistry and no emotional connection. All of their interactions feel very stiff and unnatural. The whole ""romance"" just feels like a plot gimmick to explain why Han became who he was in the original trilogy. But, because the characters do not feel emotionally invested in each other, it falls flat.In the scene where Qi'ra takes over Crimson Dawn, we see her talking to a hologram of Darth Maul. Now correct me if I'm wrong, but he died many years before this movie takes place. And I know comic books and other Star Wars media have said that Darth Maul did not really die, but these sources are not accepted as canon. So Darth Maul being in the movie--unexplained--is very confusing. According to the movies--which are canon--he dies. So why is he suddenly alive and talking to Qi'ra? And how is he connected to Crimson Dawn? Is Crimson Dawn working for the empire? Throughout the movie, it's implied that Crimson Dawn is just a heartless gang. But are their evil purposes more in line with the Empire than we think? None of these things are explained, which makes this scene and Crimson Dawn's importance in the Star Wars universe very confusing.One thing I did like was Lando. He was the character that made the movie worth watching. His acting was brilliant, and he really seemed like the Lando from the original trilogy. His character gets some added depth in this movie, which was really fun to watch. And his relationship with Han was perfect. The two had great chemistry, and their scenes together were probably the best in the movie.I would not recommend this movie. The characters are flat and unemotional for the most part, the plot is contrived and confusing, and the ending is horrible. It ends, and you're left wondering ""Is that really it? Nothing was explained!"" This movie seems very much like a setup for a sequel, with plenty of unexplained loose ends and characters that should play a larger role in the Star Wars universe than they do in this movie. But, unless we know that a sequel is coming out, we should not be left wondering why certain characters were motivated to do the things they did, why other characters did not have stronger emotional reactions to what should be key moments in their life, and why characters who should be dead are suddenly alive and well. Each movie should be able to stand on its own as a well-explained story with a strong plot and compelling characters. This movie had none of these things. If you're looking for a fluff watch with no real depth or character development, then this may be for you. But if not, this probably isn't a movie you want to watch.",0,0,0,0

There's lots of pages, there's dialogue and there's stuff that happens and it's all written in prose that is definitely passable.  But if you're the kind of person who likes the original books, and cares that they are light years beyond this one, then don't even bother reading it.  Don't let that morbid desire to ""know what happened"" get to you and make you read the book.  You'll be happier not knowing every detail of every aspect of every character's past.  I'm not going to accuse Brian Herbert of being a bad person for trying to cash in on his father's stuff, but it really shows in these books.  The narrative is boring and uninteresting.  The plots are predictable, the characters are bad space-opera Star Wars-style characters and it all just feels like a blatant attempt to ""explain"" things mentioned in the original series.

This cart seemed to be a good price and didn't have the *worst* reviews, so I went ahead an ordered it.When the cart showed up, it was clearly damaged. The metal was bent and the basket had been assembled improperly. I had to switch around the way the basket was installed so that the wheels would install properly.

To make matters worse, due to the way the metal was bent, I couldn't install the wheels correctly -- there was no way to get the pin on the other side of the bar.Once assembled, I was worried about its ability to actually hold anything. So I took it on a test run to the grocery store a few blocks from us. It's supposed to be able to carry 50 pounds? Nope. The axle snapped on the way back and the entire cart collapsed.

I thought that Coldplay would try to branch into a new sound that could inspire me more than their more deliberate commercial release of Rush of Blood to the Head but X&Y is as lively as a rotting animal curled up by the side of the highway.,0,0,1,1

RW2E43PNM5SDM,"Well, luckily, my hole-punching needs are neither precise nor often. This was about the cheapest 3-hole punch available and I guess I got what I paid for. My main issues are: It will only accommodate around 15-20 pages at a time, which wouldn't be so bad except it also has no facility for orienting the punches in the same place on any two batches of pages, so if you're punching a 100 page document to go into a binder, the pages won't all line up perfectly with each other.

RJFJTBK7OFW48,"I had to come back to turn in a very poor performance on this retractable ink joyI had to come back to review the poor performance/failure of my retractable ink joy pens (set of 8).  I was so surprised by the product repeated failure - and the company response.  Within a month of use, the green ink gathered between the retracted tip and translucent  barrel and created blotches when trying to write.  I contacted the company, they requested I send back the pen in a padded envelope (so they could research failure) and they sent a replacement pen a month later, not convenient but ok response.  By the time the replacement arrived, another pen had failed in the same way and within 5 months a total of four of the 8 pens have failed (two remaining pens have not been used/still have tip seal on them).  I emailed customer service (3 failed pens, orange, turquoise and the new green) and got the same request to wrap up and ship them back- sorry not interested in taking my time and $ to ship defective product back again.  I have not had any problem with their removable cap model of ink joy- but they are not as quick for jotting a note with.  The positive- the colors are cool and when the pens are working they are very fluid and smooth- hence the two stars.  All in, I will not buy again.  I will also say I store the retractable and the removable cap pens vertical, in a pencil cup, but I would hope that is not the limiting factor for successful use.",0,0,0,0
R1QUEH9DG437OI,"Like many reviewers I was happy when I first bought this in 2014. I am a small home based business and mostly print 10-20 color estimates per day. I wasn't wowed with the print quality but thought it was good enough. It's easy to use and scans well. Printing envelopes worked okay, but sometimes creases the envelope.About 6 months later the paper started coming out with imprints that looked like embossing. Online research showed there's a fuser problem. Brother support was good and swapped it out for a new printer. In 2015 the same thing happened again. This time they had me take it to a local repair shop (under warranty) and they replaced the fuser. Fast forward to 2016 and the same thing happened again but the warranty is expired.In the long haul, this Brother printer does not hold up. You may get a year out of it but be prepared to replace once the warranty is gone.Due to fuser problems I recently replaced with the HP M477fdw. Wow! What a difference. The print quality is much better. The speed and printing noise is better also. The HP starts printing immediately and the quality of prints is much more crisp and professional looking.

R3DUYF2JP9U5PQ,"This is utterly amazing !! I had just fired up this P/C to try to make contact with you to report my dislike for this very same drill bit set and when this page opened up....Saved me a lot of frustration on finding out what to do...Where  has ""quality control"" gone to? I ordered this nice looking DBS about 1 month ago but didn't get an opportunity to use it until yesterday afternoon in an attempt to drill out a broken off bolt .. An operation that I have done many hundreds of times in my 70 years of the many types of tools.. I lost all my tools in that Hurricane that hit central NJ so hard last Nov-Dec.. Not wanting to  even attempt to replace every drill bit that was rust encrusted I decided to buy this smaller set.. It looked and read like it would suffice for my few remaining years!!  Well imagine my surprise when after ""dimpling"" the center of said  1/4"" bolt I proceeded to this ""easy job"".. I was using a new Bosch PS21-2A 12 Volt drill so I know that I was NOT abusing the bit in question.. Was about 1/4"" in when I felt ""snap"", and I said ""OH S--T""!!  I cleared the hole and skipped over the next size bit and went to 11/64""..Was just hitting bottom of the 1st started hole and I felt another ""snap"".. Disgusted I retrieved a couple of my rusty bit's, cleaned the rust off and finished the job with no problem... I hope the remaining 28 bit's give better service than these 2 did !!!Well today, about a month after I posted the previous review, I attempted to drill 3 holes, 13/64th, in a Wrot Copper plumbing fitting, approx. 3/16"" thick, and the drill bit came loose from it's ""staked"" in position in it's holder.. When the 1st bit's snapped a few weeks ago I called eToolcity.com and they sent me 3 bit's to replace the ones that broke, however the replacements were not treated with that gold colored coating, Nitrate or whatever it is..  Going to try to return for replacement !!",0,0,0,0

Personally, I enjoy pens that work and write smoothly. To get the BIC 4-Color Ball Pen to release any ink whatsoever, I had to scribble all over the paper I was using. Not only did it ruin the appearance of what I was attempting to write on, but it also stopped releasing the ink about ten seconds after it had finally started. I wouldn't recommend these pens to anybody. I'm sure there must be a better multi-color pen in the world, and if there's not, you can always just buy a bunch of different colored pens that actually work. Trust me, you don't want to buy these.

R2SN8JWRMP1X0S,"I was a loyal HP printer owner and I still have an old tank, ten years old (820Cse) that refuses to die but it uses a parallel cord and well, it needs to be retired.  These newer HPs that should be so much improved have become throw away units and you should throw them away before you install them and save yourself a lot of trouble.  After I put in new ink cartridges my last one wouldn't calibrate.  So I looked for recommendations for a printer and this Lexmark had high marks.  For me it installed without a hitch.  I now have four computers networked to the Lexmark  printer.  One by USB, two laptops wireless, and a second desktop via DSL network. Now we have the test of time in progress.  Will it last? but so far it works great.Update and downgrade (3/2012): I reinstalled my router and after that I couldn't get the printer to work on my network.  I did not call tech support, ya know, hate the wait and ya gotta be sharp that day to click this and click that, just dread to do it.  But on my primary computer, it still worked fine albeit slow.  The machine will take the time to suck the page back inside to print the back of the page even when there is no back of the page.  One of the big selling points that drew me in was the $4.99 black cartridge.  Well, the printer is designed to trickle in a little color into the black.  I suppose that makes the black blacker.  This is to herd the cattle over with their money to buy the expensive color set.  I always click draft quality and most of the time even click black only, yet somehow the color got all used up, but when the color is out it will not print with the $4.99 black.  The set of three colors go for $52 at Office Depot and the same at Amazon .  I used the HP820 for years with the color cartridge bone dry.  I am gonna try a Brother HL-5340D Laser.

I was hoping this printer, the Brother MFC-9340CDW, would also be the same.Setup was very easy, instructions were very clear, and the interface is wonderful. Wifi/AirPrint printing worked great.

The fax setup was pretty easy as well.  The colors are great too.

R20WUPT3CVG5K4,"Before anyone goes ballistic, let me say right off the bat that the ONLY reason I am giving this Blu-Ray a rating of 1 star is because of the embedded subtitles.  In my opinion, this film, along with Plata Quemada, The Killing of Sister George, The Boys in the Band, The Fox, Chamaco, The History Boys, El Lugar Sin Límites, Le Salaire de la Peur, Una Giornata Particolare, and a few others I won't mention for the sake of brevity, is one of the great gay films of all time, and destined to become a classic.  It's a film about love, and the power of love to move mountains, and to make imperfect human beings do perfect things in the face of adversity.  It's a film about doing the right thing, and the irony (and the beauty) of this story is that it is only by owning up to his actions and by being true to himself that the protagonist finally becomes a real man.  I love this film, and if I had to select a dozen movies to take with me to a deserted island, this would be one of them.So why only 1 star?  Blame it on the subtitles.  In this day and age, with Blu-Ray technology being what it is, Wolfe is way behind the times and insists on embedded subtitles.  A damn nuisance!  If you speak the language that the film is in (in this case Spanish), having the damn subtitles obstructing picture clarity is the absolute pits.  It ruins your viewing pleasure, and furthermore it detracts from it, because mentally you're reading the subtitles and doing your own translating at the same time, and in most cases finding fault with the English translation given by the subtitler.  It's a mess!If I'm going to pay top money for a Blu-Ray release, then I want to have the choice of OPTIONAL subtitles.  I don't want subtitles imposed on me.  I think ALL releases should have subtitles.  In the case of films spoken in English, subtitles are ESSENTIAL because the sound engineers nowadays have a field day adding ambient noises and sound effects to everything, and most times these are so overwhelming that they totally block out the dialogue, making it unintelligible.  In the case of foreign films, subtitles are obviously necessary, but they should be OPTIONAL.  There are roughly 60 million people of Hispanic origin living in the United States.  There are also a few million that are not native Spanish speakers but speak Spanish fluently or otherwise.  These people should have the option of viewing this wonderful film unencumbered, or switching on the subtitles if they so wish.Now, if Wolfe really wanted to do things right, like the protagonist of this film, then they would have included both English and Spanish optional subtitles.  Why?  Because the Spanish spoken in this film is peppered with local Peruvian idiomatic expressions that are not familiar to ALL Spanish speakers.  For you Americans, that would roughly equate to Cockney dialect being spoken in a British film, or just regular British words like bloke for guy, bird for girlfriend, water closet or loo for restroom, and fancy for like.I speak Spanish, French, Italian, and Portuguese besides English.  If I had my way, ALL films released on DVD and Blu-Ray in the United States (where I live) would have a minimum of 2 subtitles, one being English, and the other being the language the film is spoken in.  If I'm watching a film in French, for instance, and I'm missing a few words here and there, I'd much rather read the subtitles in the original French than an English translation that may or may not be altogether accurate.I hope whoever re-releases CONTRACORRIENTE when Wolfe's license expires will do it right and include both English and Spanish OPTIONAL subtitles, because this is a little masterpiece of a movie that deserves to be seen, understood, and enjoyed by as many people as possible.  Are you listening, Javier Fuentes-León?  How about giving us Spanish subtitles of your original script?  And I hope Wolfe stops its horrible practice of embedded subtitles for all its releases.  That stinks, Wolfe.Please watch this film.  It's a little gem.  And please watch all those other films I mentioned.  And please, liberated ones, I want no flack about The Boys in the Band.  I think it's marvelous, and it's a masterpiece.  I don't think it's Neanderthalish, or demeaning, or any of those abusive adjectives that have become fashionable to throw at it.  If you feel so strongly about Pride, then don't waist your time dissing The Boys, put it to better use: go out and fight for marriage equality.",0,0,0,0

R2K5ZTYBX858R9,"The Aeron is the first high dollar office chair I have ever purchased. Recently I have begun to work from home and in a remote part of the US and have been unable to go test chairs out in person. So I did extensive online research and looked at as many reviews about the best bang for the buck office chairs and the Herman Miller Aeron was by far at the top of the heap according to those reviews. Other notes I am 6'4"" and 265lbs, have had lower back problems in the past, and work approx 10-12 hours per day in the office. With this criterion my needs are definitely custom to most office chair users. There is many Big and Tall Chairs out there to review. Most of these are for the combination of big and tall not just tall. The Aeron has a size chart that puts my height and weight into the C type chair and advertises two different lumbar options. One is stationary and the other adjustable. I chose the adjustable lumbar with my order. Once I received the chair I put it together. The chair is very simple to install only taking 10-15 mins. The chair is good looking as well. I then went through the instruction guide and adjusted the settings to my liking and begun to use the chair immediately. I have to say that I am very disappointed in the chair. The height of the back is not quite what I was expecting and when I lean back the chair top is at the middle of my shoulder blades. It is not very comfortable there and I will honestly say that I did not take a good look at the specs for the back height. All the reviews I perused were all positive on the mesh seat and back. This will be my first experience with a mesh back and seat and it was not a good one. With the mesh back is its locked and upright position it allows for my mid and upper back to sink in to the point of which there is no support at all for any part of my back except for the lumbar I ordered as an option. The mesh seat has a multitude of concerns for me. 1st of all it has no traction. This means it allows for my butt and thighs to slide forward ever so slightly every few minutes depending on how much motion I have in my normal daily tasks. 2nd the mesh seat drops all my bottom weight into the middle of the seat and strains the tailbone in a way that I have not experienced before. I feel after a few hours of sitting like I was sitting on a bench or in bleacher seating. The back and front of the seat is hard plastic, so as I put my butt back as far as I can in the seat for proper ergonomic posture I can feel the back of the plastic part of the seat under my butt and under my thighs as well. This brings me to the next point of concern. This seat is not made for anyone over 6 feet. The seat is too short for my long thighs. The seat does not come under my legs enough to support my thighs which in turn makes my posture less desired. As you can probably tell from my review I am constantly having to move and adjust and occasionally stand and walk around for a few minutes every hour or so for posture relief. I am not sure about someone of a little less weight and height but this chair was not for me and now I am on the hunt for another chair hopefully at a comparable or less price. Because to be honest the price of the chair for me was very expensive, considering it having so many drawbacks.",0,0,0,0

R3UFDGM22QPSMV,"UPDATE: I was never contacted by Company/C.S. after review. Be aware: Stickers are NOT included! Will not re purchase.I really like the aesthetic portion of the planner, it's beautiful in its design and it will be extremely useful for productiveness. I have two minor things that made me knock off two stars.First, the grammar mistakes on the cover, such as ""capricon"" and ""pieces"". I believe this should lower the value of the planner, for $35 ish dollars, you expect it to be grammatically correct. Everything else on the inside is precise, as far as I can tell.Second, the advertisement suggests that you will be receiving bonus stickers and I never received any stickers at all. This upsets me because that was a deciding factor between this planner and another planner. This is deceiving and that would have ultimately made me pick another planner, had I known that there weren't going to be any stickers included.As for the pros, I do see myself using this planner because I like the way it is organized. It just works for me. I counted 12 months and it has 5 weeks per month. It seems sturdy enough to where I don't see any future problems with the pages coming off. The binding is very well put. The rose-gold color is gorgeous and it's exactly what I was looking for. I wanted a specific layout for my planner and I'm glad this is able to satisfy that. That being said, I hope customer service acknowledges my 2 complaints. If so, I will be purchasing again next year. To be updated.",0,0,0,0

R2OLWTG9R59484,"LADY MACBETH is not to be confused with the Shakespeare play MACBETH. Instead this film is based on the 1865 novel “Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District” written by Nikolai Leskov. The film itself judging by reviews is either one you love or hate. Place me somewhere in between in that confused and bored category.The story revolves around Katherine (Florence Pugh), a young woman sold into marriage to a man twice her age named Alexander (Paul Hilton). From their wedding night forward he may sleep with her but never attempts to consummate their marriage. Instead he is a controlling tyrant who insists that she disrobe for him each night before bed and constantly tells her to stay indoors.When an accident at one of the businesses his father owns calls him away, Katherine immediately begins to disobey his wishes, walking the grounds as she chooses. Her only companion is Anna (Naomi Ackie), a servant who obeys her master but answers to Katherine.One day Katherine catches the farm hands have hoisted Anna up in a canvas saying they are trying to weigh her. Katherine forces them to let her down but is intrigued by what she saw. She tells the ringleader, a new groomsman named Sebastian (Cosmo Jarvis) to guess her weight upon which he lifts her in his arms.Apparently this is all it takes as the two begin a shameful affair spending most of their nights in bed together. When her father-in-law returns he attempts to set her straight on how to behave. The end result is his being poisoned with mushrooms and then Katherine and Sebastian return to the carnal encounters. As a result of the master’s death Anna loses her ability to speak.At some point the inevitable return of Alexander is bound to happen. What transpires from there is something best left for those who make the choice to watch the film. If you are not among that group then my suggestion would be to seek out other reviews as someone is bound to make it common knowledge.For me the film was as detached from emotions as Katherine was when the film began. Taking place in 1865 it has that feel of a gothic romance novel without the gothic castle location or the actual romance. Instead that is replaced with lust and physical contact. Imagine Heathcliff and Catherine romping around in bed, remove the romance and you’ll get the idea of what I’m talking about here.While watching it was easy to note the style being used with little or no music to interfere with the story. The dialogue is kept to short sentences when used. The décor is true to the time period with little extras to be found in the house and the costuming is the same. This might lend itself to realism but it also tends to add to the boredom as well.The performances are there with little that is exceptional. Of the characters it is Pugh as Katherine that has the most to offer here but her outlook and behavior is so dour that the changes in her personality are unexceptional. The change from purchased wife with a frigid husband to full on adulterous tramp is hard to believe. Those that love the film view this as an attempt at combating the patriarchal system of the time, a liberation of the female character from her surroundings. I say if you view it that way then you’re more pretentious than you should be.I’ve never been fond of movies that attempt to create deep “art”, normally finding that if the attempt is being made then the odds are the results will be a grandiose attempt to create something that doesn’t actually exist. A recent blurb describing another film said something to the effect if you have to explain what you just watched then the movie wasn’t very good. Movies like this, where the goal is to make a film with supposed deeper roots than are on display, fail miserably at what they set out to do. True art in film more often comes without the intent of it being so.Perhaps there are other out there who will enjoy the film and I say good for you. As for me it was difficult to stay awake and watch. Compound that with the early scenes of Katherine being told to disrobe by her husband, watching an actress in a role that requires her to do so and then considering the furor over Harvey Weinstein and his behavior and it just leaves you with a bad feeling.",0,0,0,0

R9L59WV1RUK8N,"There are two kinds of people in this world. People who think Crash is a gripping, emotional tour-de-force and an insightful look at racism in our culture.

R1NGCN40DSQDR5,"I can't believe that this film was made by the same Wachowski brothers who made the (excellent) first Matrix. It plays as if they handed a big wad of money to someone who specialises in brainless action flicks (e.g. starring Van Damm or Vin Diesel or Arnie) and said ""here, go and spend this stringing together some cool action sequences, don't worry about logic or continuity at all"".Okay, sure the characters are the same, but the whole style is different. There are far too many repetitive action sequences, e.g. at least 20 closeup shots of Temuera shouting ""AAaaaargh!"" as he fires round after round of ammo into the sentinels - by the 20th time, I felt like shouting ""AAaaaargh!"" as well. There was oodles of supposed Matrix ""philosophy"", but unlike the first two Matrices, none of it actually made sense, or continued from the structure established by the earlier films!I could attack every minute of this shockingly bad film (every minute was flawed), but here's just one example: In the end, Neo offers peace to the machines, and they accept, letting him back into the matrix to defeat Smith. WHAT?! Did we forget that the machines NEED to keep humanity enslaved as their only source of energy? What the hell is this supposed to mean?Could go on and on, but won't.

R28T4UKQU97DOP,"I purchased this safe after a moderate amount of research and thought all was well until last week. I started using it and discovered they keys I received didn't work (wrong cut completely). I had a locksmith come out and open the safe so I could retrieve something I had inside it (see below). I could have easily used a hammer or crowbar to get it open but it would obviously ruin the safe.Here's what I can say at this point:1) It's a sturdy safe by a well-known brand but the locking function should be considered a deterrent, not something that will prevent access.2) Check to see if the correct keys were sent. I read many reviews and several complained of the key breaking off inside the lock. I would probablt would also have broken them but decided to call a pro. The locksmith confirmed the keys I received were the wrong ones.3) I like the safe itself--it is heavy and more than adequate for what I need it for.4) Finally (seems kind of obvious now...) before putting something in the safe, make sure the keys you received work!It is after the warranty period, so I spent $100 to get the safe opened without ruining it and to have new keys made that actually work.

R3VNPU6CG8RDBE,"This novel is simply one in the line of Finnegan's Wake. What I do is open the book at any point and start to read for a few minutes and then go back to a serious and more well rounded novel like something from John Barth or poetry by Neruda. I love the 5 star reviews on this website. They are almost always caught in the gloaming of excesses that accompany complete adoration and obscene misunderstanding.Well, I don't think I have finished this novel but at some point I expect to have read every page yet out of order. Really, does it matter. I get the feeling that this book was written by a very human robot on meth. That is all I can say for the author as he does not seem to care about his fanbase and rarely makes an appearance or even an interview available.Plot: uh ha, hahahahaha! Dear reader, you are not so worthy as to receive a coherent or even interesting plot as to find in your little 15 dollar booklet an ever increasingly disparaging amount of passages that seem to find worth in words but not in full syntactic sentences that ever cohere to anything resembling a readable or enjoyable novel. Burroughs and Kerouac and even Joyce minus Wake grew more and more obscure, yet still for the most part humorous and never condescending to the proficient student of literature (which is all of us). There are exceptions, of course, and I really will read Mason & Dixon if what I hear is true; that it in no way resembles this here profound yet meaningless template of wooden characterization and soulless passion.This book however seems overjoyed even zealous to go from one subject to the next incorporating 3 more subjects in the last line and then divulging to the next 2 subjects within a half line more, all the while introducing four characters of who none will appear again except if you are lucky 350 pages later in some crazed paranoiac rant or dream that is really in truth only mildly interesting to peruse and read or judge. It grows tedious. With the release of Pynchon's new novel a mere half decade or less after Against The Day--almost inconceivable by past practice--I have come to the conclusion that he may be a hack, part genius, but ultimately a robot in disguise; a fickle heartless machine of a man out to make a living just like everybody else.

For the first 6 months or so the printer worked great - good print quality on black and white, color, paper, pictures etc.  The wireless feature also worked great on several home PC's.  Combined with the low ink price it was a real winner.  Lately however it has performed miserably.  Black ink cartridges although low in cost seem to be consumed after printing 10-20 pages.  I uploaded the firm ware a couple of weeks ago based on on-line chat support from Lexmark.  I was hopeful that this would solve the problems.  No such luck.

While this book is a fast, easy read, I didn't see what a lot of the other reviewers saw in this book.Not that it isn't entertaining.  TAGD is a historical romance, but when comparing Koen to writers such as Phillipa Gregory and even Jean Plaidy, Koen's book seems transparent and fluffy.  Her characters are somewhat unsympathetic and seem to lack basic common sense at times.  Its hard to like anybody in this book as many of the characters seem to fall into stereotypes, i.e. the wronged woman, the doting matriarch, the wicked mother.  Also, some of the plot twists are so obvious in coming, i.e. ""one man's dark secret.""Yes, the book is a fun beach read type of work.  But, don't be disappointed if you come to this book and realize that it just doesn't have the emotional connectivity to character like other books, such as The Constant Princess or The Other Boleyn Girl.

I learned a lot by reading this. This is a type of a book for a 20 year old person who is interested in science technology and physics. Not a kind of a book for a 9th grader to be reading. But I give the author credit because even some things interested me and I am a very hard critic.  Lewis Thomas' book is a basically  about  a well written collection of essays. It views a biological life also people opinions on it. In most chapters it tells you about things that could happen that are bad. If something hit a cell and it could cause damage to your body. For instance they talk about germs, and pheromones things like that. The guy is saying threw out the book we must learn to have a more caring and protective attitude toward Nature and environment. (which I agree on ). In this book you learn about a lot of things like DNA, mitochondria and bacteria, pheromones,meningitis,diptheria things like that. It has a lot of biological facts and theories, but does not really make the reader understand. You need to have strong knowledge of all these scientific terms to understand some of the book. I would probably rate this a 2 because I need more knowledge to understand the concept on this book.",0,0,0,0

I sell vinyl-cut decals, and these aren't quite stiff enough to keep them from getting bent or creased in the mail. Each time I mail one, I cut up a second one, inserting an extra piece of the cardboard into the envelop I'm actually sending to stiffen it a bit. So essentially I'm using 3 mailers for ever 2 that actually go out. Also, since the cardboard is just glued together on the inside, the actual usable size of the mailer is reduced (and uneven, depending on where the glue is). So don't expect to get the full usable size. All in all, I'll still use them up, but I wouldn't buy them again.",0,0,0,0

ROOZHDLDF320A,"Nightwing Vol. 1 Traps and Trapezes throws Richard Grayson back on the saddle as the witty, acrobatic crime fighter Nightwing. For the last year, Dick has been occupying the mantle of Batman in Bruce Wayne’s absence, and now he is readjusting to life as… himself. Nightwing is in the prime of his life, being a practically flawless acrobat, remarkable fighter, and exceptional detective. “Traps and Trapezes” follows Nightwing, who while trying to focus on the present, is confronted by his past when Haly’s Circus returns to Gotham for the first time since his parents’ deaths.Kyle Higgins author of Deathstroke (which I rated 3 stars) is given a good superhero, but delivers a so-so story. It’s a very fast-paced story, taking Nightwing from city to city with Haly’s circus. In my opinion Higgins didn’t truly cement the character, but instead turned him into a “rolling stone”. The redeeming factor however, wasn’t the special guest appearance from a certain Bat family member, but Eddy Barrows’ nice artwork and decent action sequences.Overall, I wouldn’t recommend this book to those who aren’t die-hard Nightwing fans. I recommend that DC assign another author to save this series (unintentionally bashing Higgins). Nightwing Vol. 1 collects issues 1-7 (2.5 stars).",0,0,0,0

R27N6AL1754D5E,"I bought Spin because of the great reviews.  Clearly, I am in the minority, but I am sorely disappointed.  It could have been a much better read.Spin has a great idea. The Earth is wrapped in a time distortion field that makes the world beyond Earth go by faster than Earth itself.  (At least, it does from our perspective.)  Figuring out the nature of the spin and why it happened is the crux of the book.  And, it seems the idea and some plot points were well thought out.  I like big ideas.But, the characters are very one dimensional and do not grow over time. The main character, who is a young boy at the beginning of the book, acts in the same way at the start as he does at the end.  He does not grow or change in any way.  Another main character joins a fanatical cult.  Yet, we do not experience what happened to the character that would drive this outcome.  There are also people who come and go for no reason other than to further a plot point.  You do not feel how these other people change the main characters at all.Towards the end, I started reading faster just because I wanted to pick up the plot points and to see why the spin happened.  The fate of the characters did not interest me at all.",0,0,0,0

R3S55U5PYKTJB7,"CEASED PRINTING AFTER JUST A FEW MONTHS - Print head was clogged just a few short months into the life of this printer.  I didn't know what the problem was though so I bought new XL cartridges thinking it needed new ink and of course it still would not print.  The 5690 printed very poor quality pages for a few months before never working again.  Unfortunately I bought this when it was 369 USD, whereas now I see them for 210 USD.  I used the cleaning feature to no avail and even hired a computer technician who told me it might be a loss!  Because of the hundreds of dollars already spent on this printer itself and on two sets of XL cartridges, am going to try the home cleaning kit as a last resort.  I can't believe it came highly rated in Consumer Reports, which is what prompted me to spend 369 on an inkjet printer in the first place.  Also, even in its short life when it was printing shoddy pages of text, it was VERY difficult to connect to any device via wi-fi and required turing the wi-fi off and on.

This was a horribly written novel, romance or otherwise, with poorly developed relationships and a very trite theme.  The hero, Hunter, supposedly has this deep hatred of whites; yet for no apparent reason (other than her beautiful golden hair...and that she's so ""brave"" in attempting suicide by starvation) he falls completely inexplicably in love with her in a matter of days.  His character was also unbelievably ""good"" and I just couldn't buy it.The heroine was also super annoying. It was basically 400 pages of her being hot and cold, trusting/not trusting, about the hero.  I seriously think I could have skipped the entire middle half of the book and not missed much.If you want a great Native American themed romance novel, with great characters and one of the sweetest unorthodox love stories, try Dancing on Coals by Ellen O'Connell.

RMOUWZBOM7ALV,"I was really upset when I received my item in a beat-up box where the paper cutter handle was exposed and was just hanging by a thread with the tape around it. It was not very pleasing to the eyes. I bought this cutter because of the reviews and the price. Sometimes, it's better to pay more to have fewer headaches.Some of my thoughts...1. The box that it came in was beat-up. It was the original box but come on, it was ripped everywhere.2. There was a clinging sound inside. A tiny piece broke off (probably from the shipping) when I was trying to take off the tape to open the box.3. The locking mechanism was broken. When I finally got all of the tapes around the box, that handle with a freaking sharp edge just popped open on my face. That was a little something. There's no way for me to lock it in place either.  So it just stayed lifted. Not safe at all.4. The handle is already chipped and the adjustable backstop was fractured (plastic material).5. The paper cutter was sharp and lightweight but I guess you will have to put some weight when you try to cut papers and make sure it's on a flat open space area for safety.6. It was a perfect size for home-use. It wasn't too big or small to just do normal document or paper cuttings.I contacted Amazon to return my item and finally, on the 3rd day the company reached out to me. I appreciated their response and they seemed genuine about their feedback. Just sad I can't use the cutter and will have to find something else.",0,0,0,0

Unfortunately instead of following Menolly, the main character of the first two books, this book switches focus to Piemur, who we met in book two.  I think the book suffers quite a bit for this.  While Piemur goes through the same growing pains that Menolly did in trying to find his spot in the world, I found that I just didn't care about him. I was either rolling my eyes as he kept silent about the hazing he was receiving from his bunkmates as that hazing escalated to attempted murder, or rolling my eyes as he went in the complete opposite side of reactions and stole something very important from a holder he was spying on.  I found myself scanning the last part of the book, which rehashed Menolly's adventures in living holdless, just in a different location.  The only parts of the book I really cared for were those were we returned to Menolly's viewpoint.I think the whole book could have been better if McCaffery had stuck to Menolly's viewpoint.",0,0,0,0

R38W1FAJ22U0DP,"Wow. So this one was pretty predictable. And dull. It seemed like an idea that would set a 13 year old boy on fire but would seem too stretched, too stupid, to work on anyone past high school. Remember how in the 90s video game plots started becoming more mature, but that essentially meant adding blood and guts to a simplistic, inane, half-baked idea? When drama and characters essentially didn't exist? This book feels like it came from this time. It feels like Night Trap: The Novel.Honestly, it's poor. Serial killers turned super soldiers? Hardly. It's just dumb. Don't even get me started on the whole grandma-with-a-shotgun sideplot. I think it was meant to add some drama, but it's just so forced. Even Jerry Bruckheimer would laugh at the lack of subtlety.Overall this book has good reviews. I'm a bit shocked and must respetfully disagree with the majority. This is one of those books where someone seems kind and benevolent, and suddenly becomes the face of all evil. Yes, he could have been lying, but he turns evil to someone he loved and was still on his side. Just because. No reason. And that's the bottom line of this book - no reason. No complexity. No purpose. Not even any interesting blood, gore or violence. Just the emptiness that comes from an idea as shallow as serial killers turned super soldiers.",0,0,0,0

RDIQR329JOVBT,"I've read the last three in this series.  Bangkok 8 and Bangkok Tattoo were excellent.  Bangkok Haunts less so. With The Godfather of Kathmandu it appears that Burdett is just mailing it in.  I give it two stars because of some of the interesting, mostly parenthetical, observations.  The plot is a real mess.  A tragedy occurs to one of the characters, yet I didn't feel it, and I didn't believe the character felt it.  Trying to follow the permutations of the Vikorn vs. Zinna wars, the smuggling of heroin by a telepathic Tibetan, and the murder or suicide of an American film director is just a little too much.  None of it fit together, none of it felt like it could have actually happened, and none of the characters other than Sonchai (who was fleshed out a bit in the earlier books) was interesting.  I think maybe the author is just getting tired of this subject.  It was hard to read.  I try to read books all the way through, and stuck with it to the end, but it was a chore to do it.  Instead of discipline, the author gets more and more preposterous, and that just doesn't do it for me.

R10OYE1UIGFPRR,"I bought this on Sept. 10, 2015.  I had to call Epson to help set up the printer.  They only set it up for copy and fax so I had to call back to set it up to scan. The customer service reps are hard to understand.  They do not do a good job of explaining the set up process.  Maybe it is because they are just reading out of a manual like most overseas customer service reps do.  In March of 2016 I started having problems printing with the black ink.  The printer doesn't recognize the ink cartridges I installed.  I use only original Epson ink.  The black cartridge will not print correctly it skips lines when it prints.  The chamber that holds the ink cartridges can not be opened without forcing it open.  It slides so far over to the right that part of it is under a piece of plastic and the chamber door can't be opened properly.

So, I am going to get someone else's problem just like someone will get my problem once they refurbish mine.  Obviously, this happens quite frequently.

R1JNV8LUB4STNY,"I don't recommend this.  I have been listening to Behemoth since 2002 (Zos Kia Cvltvs is still the best IMO, but I've liked every other album since until this one) and I had high hopes for this album.  I really wanted to like it.  But I just don't like it.  And by don't like it,  I mean I don't like a single song on the entire album.  I literally went through the entire album giving every song 2 stars out of 5 in my itunes.  Nothing terrible here, but nothing really good.Ok the music itself.  It's very...watered down.  No track on this album matches the extreme brutality of any preceding record.  I'm sorry, but I buy Behemoth records because I want blackened death metal.  That's not this.  The last two tracks in particular almost seem to veer into arena rock or power ballad territory at certain points.  It seems that Nergal attempts to make up for this for making every line of lyrics anti-christian and anti-jewish (more on this later).  It seems like Behemoth is really trying to be Behemoth, but the edge is gone.  Or you could say the whole album sounds like an imposter trying to impersonate Behemoth but never quite matching the brutal power of the music.Ok the lyrics.  Obviously with a title like The Satanist, you expect a lot of references to Satan.  But do we really need to talk about Satan for the entire album?  One of the things that made Behemoth great IMO was it wasn't just your standard fare anti christian metal references.  A lot of pagan, mysticism, and kabbalah references along with some lyrics in ancient or dead languages.  Nope none of that here.  I guess it's hard to argue with the theme of choice, but i just find it a little boring.Behemoth's lyrics have always been very anti christian.  A lot of this stems from the Catholic Church's power and influence over the band's home country of Poland.  This includes a somewhat famous legal battle pitting the band's free speech rights versus the Catholic Church feeling offended by their act.  But this album is the first that clearly has very negative jewish references.  With lines like ""Hosanna Hosanna / Tribe ov Judah decimate / Hosanna Hosanna / Root ov David eradicate"" or ""I raped and raped and raped the daughters ov Zion"" or ""Satan ov Elohim"" (BTW Nergal, there is no satan ov Elohim because there is no adversary of God in Judaism.  You're usually not one to mess up your biblical references like that).  Maybe Nergal would be surprised to find out that the band has quite a few jews listening to them.  I understand their stance against christianity but leave judaism out of your hate.  The lyrics overall feel lazy as if Nergal is trying to convince himself how angry and hateful he is.Well that's a lot of negative things I've said about the album.  I wish I didn't feel that way.  On a personal note, I was really relieved when I found out Nergal had beaten leukemia.  And maybe he has a different perspective on life now than he did before and he just doesn't have that same edge.  That's fine and I respect that.  But that doesn't mean I have to like the music out of sympathy for what he went through.",0,0,0,0

R1AJ2ASC74UBUI,"'Robert Heinlein's Citizen of the Galaxy' by Robert Lazaro, Eric Gignac and Steve Erwin, is an adaptation of a classic book.  The problem is that it's not a very good adaptation.The story follows young Thorby, a slave on a distant planet.  When no one will buy him, he is taken in by a crippled beggar.  That this will change his life is probably no spoiler based on the title of the book.  That this mysterious beggar is probably more than he pretends to be is also likely to be no surprise.  Thorby finds himself on an upward path back to back where he belongs.  Along the way he meets people who mean well by him and want to harm him.  He learns much about the galaxy around him.  How he reacts to these folks and circumstances is what should make the story.Except in this case, Thorby is just sort of pushed around to serve the story, and never seems to become his own man.  The adaptation feels like a sightseeing tour by someone who is not familiar with the territory.  The big milestones are here, but the underlying elements, like Baslim's spying on the slave trade or the true matriarchal culture of the traders.  Those things are there, but it all comes across as a bland retelling.  The art is ok, and serves the narrative well enough.  Maybe there are too many story elements and it should have been a longer adaptation, but this fell way short of my expectations.I received a review copy of this graphic novel from Diamond Book Distributors, IDW Publishing, and NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.

R160XSWXV0PS55,"UPDATE 1 Year Review: The positives I gave this chair some credit for on my initial reviews was looks and cushion. Well, after using this chair 3-5 days a week while working from home for a year, I can honestly say the initial cushion quality has gone out the window. The cushion has not held up....to the point where I’m shopping for a new chair already and I plan on spending a lot more money to get a sturdy, higher quality chair. This chai wobbles and moves in places it shouldn’t now, I feel the cheap sub material through the cushion now, and so honestly regret this purchase. It looks decent and is okay if you’re a lighter/smaller person it might be good for the only, but otherwise run away.I originally posted this review with a 4 star rating, but after working from home for a week on it, I am updating my review to sow a 3 star rating based on how uncomfortable I feel sitting in it for a long period of time. It has its upside but ultimately it is a small/tight fitting chair that is now with the money for taller people wanting it for regular use.Cons:I saw some reviews talking about how narrow the arm rests/seat area is. I figured these were picky or oversized people. Turns out they were right. Compared to my prior chair from Office Max, this chair is WAY more narrow. I’m 6’3” and “normal” sized/athletic shaped and slender....my hips are right at the arm rests (not touching but very close). Compared to my old chair, the arm rests also extend towards the front of the seat more....coupled with the narrow seat opening, the arm rests length makes it harder to get out of the chair at an angled direction. I have to swivel my chair completely sideways and stand up straight instead of partially turning and sliding in or out sideways. Also, the seat is not only narrow sideways but is is “short” longways.... sitting all the way back, the seat goes about halfway toward my knees.... my old chair went almost to my knee area (difference that is noticeable in comfort/weight distribution ). It seats almost like a driver side seat in a car given how most of your weight is on just your butt and instead of spread down your hamstrings, too. The chair just seems disproportionate and smaller than it should be. Smaller people might be good though. Last complaint is I ordered a black chair and they mailed me a white one. Easily fixed but still annoying and shouldn’t happen.Pros:Whatever shortcomings it has in comfort because of design/size, it at least got it right in the padding. This chair is one of the more comfortable home office chairs I’ve sat in under $200 when it comes to the seat cushion. The padding seems to be thick and solid without being too supportive or too soft. Aside from that, the overall look is very sharp. The chrome is nicely done and spruces the chair’s appearance up. They did a good job on the overall look. Also, the chair went together quite easily. Packaging was good, too.Conclusion:While there is enough of a cramped seat feeling to make it worth 2 stars deduction, and if it was too much smaller I would have returned it, the chair is nice enough looking and cushioned enough to make the $105 chair worth keeping now that I have it...and at the end of the day it is just big enough to work. I work from home and have already spent several hours sitting and it seems to be a a decision I’ll be able to live with, but I wouldn’t order it again if I could do it all over.",0,0,0,0

R3Y3HA0PMPI60,"Hey everyone who believed the so-called ""science"" used for this movie, better think again.  I copied this article to show that most scientists and actual data do not support the crackpot ""greenhouse effect"".  You may not believe me but read for yourself.Is the debate now over for skeptics of global warming hysteria? Readers of USA Today may certainly have that impression.""Satellite and weather-balloon research released today removes a last bastion of scientific doubt about global warming, researchers say,"" reported USA Today on Aug.12. 2005.Certainly the USA Today report was partially correct - the researchers did, in fact, ""say"" [read ""claim""] that ""the last bastion of scientific doubt"" had been removed. But claims and reality often don't match up.Three papers published in the journal Science last week purport to debunk an important argument advanced by skeptics of the notion of catastrophic, manmade global warming. The skeptics' argument is that while temperatures measured on the Earth's surface seem to indicate that global temperatures have increased at a rate of about 0.20 degrees Centigrade per decade (deg. C/decade) since the 1970s, temperatures measured in the atmosphere by satellite and weather balloons have shown only a relatively insignificant amount of warming for the same time period (about 0.09 deg. C/decade).The implication of the skeptics' argument is that whatever warming seems to be happening on the Earth's surface, similar warming isn't happening in the atmosphere. This might mean that any observed surface warming is more likely due to the urban heat island effect -- where the heat-retaining properties of concrete and asphalt in urban areas artificially increase local temperatures -- rather than increasing atmospheric levels of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide.One of the new Science studies reported that the satellites had drifted in orbit, causing errors in temperature measurement. Corrections to the satellite data, according to the researchers, would increase the atmospheric warming estimate to 0.19 deg. C/decade -- more in line with the 0.20 deg. C/decade warming of the Earth's surface. Another study reported that heating from tropical sunlight had skewed the balloon temperature measurements.Ben Santer of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, one of the studies' authors, told USA Today that, ""Once corrected, the satellite and balloon temperatures align with other surface and upper atmosphere measures, as well as climate change models.""So is it really game-set-match in favor of the global warming alarmists? Not so fast, say the skeptics.When University of Alabama-Huntsville researcher Roy Spencer, a prominent climatologist, factored the newly reported corrections into his calculations, his estimate of atmospheric warming was only 0.12 deg. C/decade -- higher than the prior estimate of 0.09 deg. C/decade, but well below the Science study estimate of 0.19 deg C/decade and the surface temperature estimate of 0.20 deg. C/decade.As to the claimed errors in the weather balloon measurements, Spencer says that no other effort to adjust the balloon data has produced warming estimates as high as those reported in the new study and that it will take time for the research community to form opinions about whether the new adjustments advocated are justified.Climate expert Dr. Fred Singer of the Science and Environmental Policy Project says the temperature adjustments are ""not a big deal.""""Greenhouse theory says (and the models calculate) that the atmospheric trend should be 30 percent greater than the surface trend -- and it isn't,"" says Singer. ""Furthermore, the models predict that polar [temperature] trends should greatly exceed the tropical values -- and they clearly don't ... In fact, the Antarctic has been cooling,"" adds Singer.Singer also had some related thoughts concerning the gloom-and-doom forecasts concerning future temperatures.Last January, a study in the journal Nature estimated that a doubling of atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide would increase global temperatures anywhere from 1.9 degrees Centigrade to 11.5 degrees Centigrade by mid-century. But Singer says the researchers ""varied only six out of many more parameters necessary to model clouds... Their result confirms... that clouds are still too difficult to model and that climate models underlying the Kyoto Protocol have never been validated.""So it's far from ""case-closed"" on global warming skepticism. Moreover, aside from the controversy over the satellite and weather balloon data, many key climate questions remain unanswered including: whether humans are causing significant warming; whether warming is undesirable; and whether anything be done to avert any undesirable warming.Because of its prohibitive costs, alarm over global warming has been rejected numerous times by President Bush and the U.S. Senate. European nations are already discovering that their economies can't live with the Kyoto Protocol that was just implemented in February.Despite alarmist media reports, global warming-mania is melting. It's no wonder the alarmists are in such a hurry to close the book on the science.[...]Hope this helped.",0,0,0,0

RO5UM4SB06EE4,"I have witheld my thoughts on this series until this book in order to better review all three books. My final analyse is that if you look at the series as only a work of fiction it might be an interesting read but since it uses actual historical events and portends to assume they way actual people (ie Grant and Lee) would have acted if the situation had been different, in my opinion its pure rubbish. The first book about Gettysburg is easily the best of the three since it is closer to the actual events and follows a course of action the participants did consider. The second and third books arer pure fiction and should be considered in that light. I think that all three books are weak in the sense they show a poor understanding of the mindset of both Grant and Lee.

R1U0TC156NPP9A,"Like a lot of SF fans of my generation, I grew up on Heinlein's juvenile novels. I've read and reread all of his fiction, have had my political and personal values shaped by him, and consider myself a huge fan. If anyone is in the target audience for this book, I am. Nevertheless I found the experience of reading this book to be a dreary chore. Where the first volume documented a part of Heinlein's life that had some intrinsic drama, this volume begins with him at the peak of his power as a writer and then goes on to document a period during which his health declined and his writing ceased to be influential in the field, while becoming more and more commercially successful. This is all documented in excruciating detail, including every medical procedure.There is a serious lack of balance in the treatment of Heinlein. Every negative review of his work is treated dismissively. Every attempt by his editors to give him guidance is described as interference by a nitwit with the work of a genius. Legal and interpersonal disputes are depicted with Heinlein's opponents as villains straight out of central casting. Whether consciously or not, Patterson adopts Heinlein's voice and point of view. Although quotes from Heinlein's papers are indented relative to the main text, the main text often reads as a continuation of the same quote or as an attempt by Patterson to channel for Heinlein. The main text is full of phrases and jokes that are clearly recycled from Heinlein's personal repertoire, as well as anecdotes recorded the way Heinlein liked to tell them.",0,0,0,0

R3VX0351FSA4VJ,"I'm doing my bit to bring down the average rating for Castaneda's book because I think that science and scholarship require rigorous honesty with both others and oneself, and Castaneda's work was a conscious and deliberate fraud.  It is also part of (and a prime influence on) a larger and long-standing trend of misrepresenting the cultural traditions of peoples ranging from the Lakota to the pre-Christian Celts, misrepresentations that always conveniently march with the author's own yearnings for peace, brotherhood, inner harmony, harmony with nature, or mind-blowing drug trips, as the case may be.There are many who support such lying, although they may call it tricksterism.  Their motives vary: contempt for rational inquiry as a disease of the Western mind, or a personal preference for imaginative possibility over too-much-work realilty, or a tricksterish joy in pulling the noses of scientists and scholars, or (perhaps) admiration of someone who managed to parlay THEIR tricksterism into fame, fortune, and a Ph.D. from UCLA.  I've read at least one ""why-should-we-care"" review in which the reviewer's attitude seems founded in the idea that only an unsophisticated, uptight person would care if Castaneda was a liar.I prefer to believe that an enlighted Westerner truly respectful of indigenous shamanic traditions should care if such a tradition is being misrepresented and exploited for money. (If indigenous peoples have not always fared well at the hands of conventional anthropology, it is merely adding injury to injury to go all postmodern on them and start treating them as fictional characters subject to infinite regressions of irresponsible description.)  Castaneda's lies aren't a critique of conventional fieldwork (as David Silverman absurdly claimed); they are merely an awful warning reminding us of the necessity for rigor in research and analysis--and some rigor on the part of the junior scholar's mentors, as well.  The conventional fieldworker who fronts himself in his writing invites the critic to evaluate his experience and discount as much of it as seems appropriate.  Castaneda, sitting in the UCLA library reading about peyote trips at times he was supposedly in the desert having them, is just lying.One reason many of his admirers don't care if he's lying is that they see him as playing Don Juan to us, putting the reader through hoops as Don Juan put him through hoops in the books.  They want there to be an imaginative truth in ""Don Juan"" that justifies the place of honor it held in their youthful reading.  But Castaneda's books aren't skillful koans begging to be deciphered in order to trigger mystical insights.  They are just clumsy and rather obvious fictional descriptions of mystical experiences that are commonplaces in fiction (including fictional encounters with shamans).  The only difference with Castaneda is that his experiences were presented as fact, and a generation of hippies invested themselves in finding significance in this claptrap when they might have found greater spiritual benefits in reading some good poetry.  Strip away the claims of literal truth from Castaneda's books, and there is no deeper or higher or more spiritual or more poetic truth.  He isn't reaching for the stars; he is lying for profit.It is perhaps useful to compare ""The Teachings of Don Juan"" to Aldous Huxley's ""The Doors of Perception,"" a sincere and well-written book that really is reaching for something.  Or Robert Graves' ""The White Goddess,"" a work often taken as descriptive history, but freely admitted by its author to be a speculative, poetic meditation on the divine sources of inspiration in Western mythic tradition.  Or Robert Pirsig's ""Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance,"" an attempt at original philosophy told (sort of) through first-person experience whose genesis was transparent and mundane.  Or the genuine self-fronted fieldwork in African Diaspora religions done by James Wafer in ""A Taste of Blood"" and Karen Brown in ""Mama Lola.""  By contrast, Castaneda is a tawdry sideshow shill.Or, to take a different sort of example, a ghost story in a collection of supposedly true ghost encounters is almost always short and matter-of-fact in writing style, with nothing like the chilling effect of a literary ghost story such as ""The Haunting of Hill House.""  There's  no reason it should be well-told, because its perceived value is as an accurate account of true experience.  If it isn't a true experience, then it had damned well better be well told.  With Castaneda, even though doubts about the veracity of his experiences began to be expressed quite early, the ""true story"" assertion carried all before it, and created a nimbus of apparent value around not very much.  (The same thing is the case with the appalling success of ""The Da Vinci Code,"" which was so popular because so many people believed it be a true--or at least plausible--account of history, employing sound methods of research and interpretation.)Most of us can look back on our youth to find infatuations that don't really stand the test of time.  (I'm looking at you, ""Collected Poems of Dorothy Parker""!)  We can appreciate in retrospect what was of value in whatever it was, and why it spoke to us, without having to prove that it really did contain the wisdom of the ages.  Let go, Don Juan worshippers!But the main point can't be made too often:  Castaneda presented lies as spiritual truth, hoaxing a generation of seekers for his own profit.",0,0,0,0

R2I621LCA2DUS4,"I didn't like Trickster's Choice very much, but because I was a fan of Tamora Pierce's I bought this book and read it, hoping the story of Alianne, the daughter of Alanna could be redeemed. Apparently, it couldn't.Trickster's Queen is a continuation of Trickster's Choice, and in this book we learn what happens to Aly, Nawat, the Raka rebellion, and the whole attempt to put the ""twice royal"" girl, Sarai, on the throne. Unfortunately, everything is totally predictable, and, well, boring.The book was fairly long, and that in itself is perfectly alright, but on top of that, it was boring. I don't know how anybody can make a rebellion boring, but Tamora Pierce certainly can. I mean, maybe I just bought a faulty copy with missing pages, but as far as I can tell, nothing ever went wrong for Aly and her crew- everything seemed to work out as planned- even better than planned thanks to the appearence of the darkings (things first introduced in the Wild Magic Quartet), Aly's ""charm"" and rescourcefullness, and a huge spy network which Aly sets up within the first couple pages of the book. Had Aly and the raka raced any setbacks, or an intellgent villian, the book would have been infinately better.My second problem with the book is the ""protagonist"" of the book, Aly. I found Aly to be a boring character thanks to her lack of personal flaws; not only was she daring and brave, but she was beautiful, charming, and daring. I'm not saying Tamora Pierce had to make Aly stupid or ugly, or anything like that, but had Pierce added some personal quirks like, maybe Aly could be afraid of heights, or spiders, or whatever, she could have been an interesting, real character. Right now I feel that Aly is a boring character whose every move is predictable.My third issue with the book is Nawat and his little romance with Aly. I'm sorry, but I just cannot get over the fact that the love interest is a crow-turned-man. This would be alright had Nawat gained a brain when he became a man, but the fact that he retained his bird-brain killed me. Everything out of his mouth was along the lines of ""Aly, lets make nestlings!"" And thanks to Nawat's one track non-existant mind, the romance between him and Aly was so, for lack of a better word, stupid. I couldn't figure out why they liked each other so much as their romance seemed to be all about ""making nestlings."" I just gained no insight into either character.And my fourth (and don't worry, final) problem is the ending of the book. And I wish I could say why but I don't want to ruin this book anymore for people.Despite it's flaws, the writing was pretty good. *Just* the plot and characters were more than lacking. I know I'm going against the flow with this review, as everybody seems to love this book for some reason. Maybe I'm just out-growing Tamora Pierce, but I don't know... I still love her books about Daine and Alanna. I think this book would be best for those 12 and under, but for me, at age 16, this book was just a great big dissapointment.",0,0,0,0

Waiting too long, ""custom stamps"" wasn't an option, and we turned to DYMO Printable Postage stamps as for our solution.Printing the stamps was fairly easy, and the stickers fit well and stuck just as fine.  The reason for my 2-star rating is because I noticed on my credit card statement there were two months following where I was being billed by the company for what I thought was a NO MONTHLY CHARGE service.  (I only used these printable stamps and not their custom stamp services).  The ""technical support rep"" refused to escalate or forward my messages to a manager or actual support rep, refused to credit the two monthly fees, and basically said ""sorry -- we think you signed up for the monthly-fee option, and although we see you didn't use its services we won't give you any refunds.""Good product.  Sub-par service.Word of warning -- be careful what you sign up for and don't expect kindness from support!",0,0,0,0

R3TY5HV0QLAB4O,"The Bad News: The Box, oh that cursed box. There are a million reasons why this pretty much sucks, but I will mention my reasons (cause I can, hell I paid the money!!!)#1 The Looks: I do not think most people would complain if it had been done for a movie or a single cancelled season or two of some show. See Total Recall, Basic instinct etc... Why? because it would stand alone and stand out. That is good marketing. You want your product to stand out. You want to be creative. Why this didn't work with the Simpson's? Well if this had been done for season #1 it would have been met with much less resistance. People would just think ""that's a pretty unique box set"" and would not have given it much extra thought.#2 the Quality: Sure the quality is not that of a tin, but I did not have the problems some others have had. I guess I did get warned about how crappy it was, so I was EXTRA careful when I opened it. I think a show with the longevity and success as the Simpson's; the network should realize that the show has been around for so long because it has DIE HARD fans (and when I say fans here I mean fanatical). They are going to be picky about the products because they are the ones shelling out TOP $$$$$ to buy the product and I mean top dollar hear. Only the Sopranos seem to be more expensive (and take as long to release). They should have been smart and only sold this as a limited collectors edition instead of making it the only choice. AND THEY SHOULD HAVE MADE A TIN THAT WOULD STAND ON ITS EDGE!!! Leaving people who are loyal customers without the choice, at the store, is a now a proven DUMB move. Always have options for the customer. Then they have no one to blame but themselves when they buy it. Any show with such a legacy should not be this incompetent.#3 Continuity: When you make 5 strait box sets that are perfectly uniform and then, do some major drugs, or hire a new marketer to try to boost sales by going off the marketing deep end by doing something radically different, don't be surprised when you get a backlash like this. Look at Seinfeld, Cheers, Married with Children, Southpark, M*A*S*H etc... They all are uniform. It is like a Trademark. Also, if they would have made this in a decent tin package and only a tin package I would still not have been thrilled. I like the continuity, like many others. The box is the trademark of the series. It is like a logo. Imagine the Nike logo changing. It is the same thing. The box is supposed to be an extension of the logo that your eyes recognize at a glance. It is called branding.#4 the Possible angle: Marketers often try to find a way to get some free publicity. Good or Bad. Look at all of the free press you can get from a stunt like this. Look at all the buzz this has created. People are REALLY talking about the Simpson's box set now. It is good to make sure you stay in the limelight. If they would not have done this, everyone would have said the same things ""great season, good shows, another hit"". This gets people talking about you. The last thing anyone in the marketing world wants is a low profile.#5 The replacement box: I think, like stated above, they should have had this at the store for an option. The problem was that they had already made a ton of them and did not want to get stuck with all the Homers heads that would be out there and decided to make this like a mail in rebate hoping that most people would not go through the effort, but they are made a miscalculation here. People will mail in for this, because they have to look at something they dislike every time they go to watch any of the Simpson's episodes. So they will constantly have to be reminded of how much they dislike this box set and the fact that they paid about $50 (with tax) on this set.#6 Why 1 Star? Because I personally hated this box set, I have the right to say how I feel, just like the rest of you. If you do not like what I write, don't read it. You can pretty much tell by the title and the stars that this is a rip on the packaging. So all of you people telling people with my views that we are idiots, losers or anal retentive, do not comment on people like me who have the right to make their own opinion good or bad. We paid the same money you did, and we have a right to our opinion without some stupid personal attack saying how wrong we are. Just state your opinion and let it be said. No need to turn this into a battle of the 13 year olds.#7 The insults on wanting a new box set package: This does not really bother me at all. They are having some fun in the Simpson's way about this whole mix up. Not a big deal to me. Hell, I laughed at it.#8 Why the one star? Because a huge corporate conglomerate should never be so incompetent when it comes the their own product. There is no excuse to remake the EDSEL. If the EDSEL were a movie, Hollywood would sure have either remade it or made EDSEL II (electric boogaloo) Coming to a theater near you.This is the first review I have given for the Simpson's and I own all of the box sets 1 - 6 now. All the people who purchased the seasons know this is a good show. My opinion is really not going to make a difference on whether someone is going to buy this or not, but hopefully my opinion will help in getting seasons 6 - 10 packaged like the seasons 1 - 5.The Good News: There are some great episodes on Season six ,but we all know that. If I just said that, and not comment on the box, this review would not be worth reading. We all know that the Simpsons is one of the best shows ever produced. I will not buy any of the seasons after season 10. I thought the show had changed dramatically after season 9, but I will buy the 10th just to have the first 10.Bart of Darkness, Lisa's Rival, Another Simpsons Clip Show, Itchy and Scratchy Land, Sideshow Bob Roberts, Treehouse of Horror V, Bart's Girlfriend, Lisa on Ice, Homer Bad Man, Grandpa vs. Sexual Inadequacy, Fear of Flying, Homer the Great, And Maggie Makes Three, Bart's Comet, Homie the Clown, Bart vs. Australia, Homer vs. Patty and Selma, A Star is Burns, Lisa's Wedding, Two Dozen and One Greyhounds, The PTA Disbands, Round Springfield, The Springfield Connection, Lemon of Troy, Who Shot Mr. Burns.All excellent.Why the long winded review?

R2UZAXHADV9PF6,"I'm normally never a 1 star rating type of person, I generally feel like it's somebody exaggerating their point.  But based off of Amazon's descriptions of each rating, 1 being ""I hate it"" I went by that standard.  I was given this product at work because it was an inexpensive solution to a tiered file folder holder. DO NOT GET THIS. Standard sized folders just barely fit on the legs, so while you're working the slightest knock, of the folders, either while doing work or while grabbing a different folder out, tend to send multiple folder's corners dropping between the legs, leaving a very messy looking setup.  Trying to fix the fallen folders tends to knock more off. It causes more time then i'd like to admit fixing and refixing the folders.  I end up feeling like those bumbling idiot characters from over-acted infomercials- ""does this happen to you??"".Eventually I just purchased a higher quality and much more expensive version on my own and have been extremely happy ever since.  The version I got was the Safco Products Onyx Mesh Desktop Organizer with 8 Tiered Sections.

That would be fine if the pens were kept in the trays, but that's impossible for me, so I numbered each pen with its corresponding refill pack. Another aggravation.  Probably unreturnable now.

R3DGQ4Z6LCN9SD,"Similar experiences with what others have already commented on - I am not giving the printer a 1 star because if did perform very well for about 2 years.  But afterwards, the quality of the printing developed numerous lines and smudges first in the color printing and now in black ink / text printing.  This did  problem did not improve with the recommended online Epson maintenance suggestions.  You also cannot access the printhead because of the printer design.Most frustrating really is that the Epson Customer Service Center required me to go through their online recommendations of printhead cleaning X 3 AGAIN even though it was completed recently and they wouldn't even provide additional options for management until after this was done.  So I wasted more ink for the printhead cleaning with the final conclusion of ""Hmm...needs to be repaired"" from the agent before be provided the information on the closest Epson Customer Service Center or a 15% discount for a new Epson printer.This was my first Epson printer based on recommendations.  It did work well for two years.

R1DTOU1NNYCTGR,"Bought my DP-X1 on November 8, 2016  and the first issue within the first two months was the battery not holding  full charge (it says its 100% but it drains within  day), so I bought an Anker charger which solved the battery charging issue.After a few months of using the DP-X1 with a headphone, the 3.5 phone jack became loose, google it and found a lot of other people had complained regarding poor quality on the jack, and so I put some glue on the rim of the jack to make it sturdy, that helped a lot.Fast forward to May, 2021 and all of a sudden, the 3.5 phone jack is NOT working properly anymore, the audio is only one channel and NO bass, just treble.For reference, (refer to photos attached with 3.5-3.5mm jack that are permanently put in placed) after my first issue with the jack, I had made it to a point NOT to remove ON-OFF the phone jack to PRESERVE it from wear and tear and yet here I am with the phone jack failing.I called the Amazon Seller who sold me the device which wonderfully replied to me within 2 hours - but sadly, they dont service the unit.I called ONKYO USA, but they DONT service the unit either (WOW, a $800 unit, top of the line DAC) and they dont offer customer service and instead told me to contact ONKYO JAPAN thru email - its been a week already and no reply and as I try to find ways to fix this unit, googling had shown multiple forum posts that ONKYO dont really care about their customers and that the DP-X1 is one of those unit that clients dont hear back from ONKYO customer service.As it turns out, the phone jack is soldered to the board and the failure point seems to be the both the 3.5m and 2.5mm balance output jacks - people had complained that the failure rate of these are very HIGH - which is SAD for a $800 unit.SO IM writing this review to inform potential buyers of ONKYO products, especially high end units - if you think you're paying high price for quality - there's NO QUALITY at ALL and definitely the CUSTOMER SERVICE is non  existent.I DO LOVE THE AUDIO QUALITY with the EQUALIZER though - but that no good at the moment since the audio jacks are not working.",0,0,0,0

R3J7DZTKRDX5BG,"<i>The Thorn Queen</i> by Elise Holland was a hard book to rate. As the story begins, we're introduced to Meylyne, a young girl of two worlds who has been forced to live in the world below as a result of her parentage while she watches the parade above though she knows she could be in deep trouble were she to be seen. It was a fascinating start to what seemed like a brilliant story. There is a sickly prince, secret scandals, and a snake people who live beneath the below world and remain separate and are condemned by those of the other two worlds. There was so much potential in the way the worlds were built, the different places and people who lived there. Holland built a deeply intriguing setting and people for her story that I was incredibly excited to learn more.But as the story progressed, this changed. Holland rarely took advantage of the truly enticing pieces she had created within her world, instead focusing on a hodgepodge of random characters and a quest-like adventure that branched off in numerous directions for seemingly no reason at all. The story, overall, felt incredibly disjointed. It was almost like those side quests in a video game that don't quite have much to do with the story, but give you a little extra piece if you decide to go ahead and do them. And I felt this way throughout much of the book. Nothing ever seemed to follow a real path, but instead all of these additional mini-quests were added to detract from the story until the author decided to return to the set upon plot.And this was irritating in itself, but forgivable as while it added some rather dull moments to the book and did hurt the reading experience, it didn't really destroy the tale. Perhaps the most problematic issue I have with <i>The Thorn Queen</i> were the characters. Not a single one was interesting past the first few chapters. I found Hope supremely annoying. I felt that Blue did not really add much to the story. And then there is the matter of Meylyne who progressively got more and more annoying as the story continued. Her character never felt developed, but instead reacted to various changes and new information about her life that slowly came into focus.Our villain, the Thorn Queen herself, was shocking in the worst possible way. There was nothing whatsoever to suggest the identity of this character and while I'm sure the author intended her identity to be a surprise, it was so out of the blue that she ended up disingenuously representing a character later on. The motivations behind the Thorn Queen made little sense, especially due to the fact that her development made a massive jump from how she was portrayed initially to what she eventually became, a jump that made very little sense in the long run. It was as though there were two completely different characters pretending to be the same one.I found I didn't care what happened to any of the characters and while I think that this story had a great deal of potential, I was thoroughly disappointed with the plot and subsequently the characters themselves as a result. Neither really complimented the other, but rather served to make each one less and less realistic. I think this story could have been fantastic, especially with the exceptional world building of the author. But it followed a strange path that never really managed to connect well and ultimately lost me along the way. I wish this book had avoided the entire plot of the Thorn Queen and gone in a different direction.I was provided a free copy of this book via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.",0,0,0,0

R6UYC5S3QXGLH,"This was the first Patrcia Cornwell I have read.  Due to the popularity of her works, I decided everyone couldn't be wrong, could they.  And the answer is Yes, they are wrong, at least as far as this book is concerned.  While Cornwell writes well and keeps you engrossed in the book (at least superficially), the book lacks any real plot. The story just meanders through a bunch of characters, some of whom seem interesting, but never really drives home any realistic plot.  As far as Kay Scarpetta is concerned, she wasn't even a major player in the book.  If fact, if I hadn't know Scarpetta was the main character of the book, I would have guessed someone else -- I think -- I really couldn't find a main character to focus on.  And as disappointed as I was about the plot (being generous here) the ending was terrible -- it just ended -- with no real buildup to an exciting conclusion.  It just tied a few loose ends together so you wouldn't have a bunch of people left out there, like the wolfman was, but got rid of most of the ones in this story -- with Scarpetta having very little to do with anything.  I suspect some of her earlier books were better, in order to have accumulated such a large reading audience (all those NY Times best sellers), but even for the loyal Cornwell/Scarpetta fans, I suspect they found this book disappointing.  The book was so bad, I am not sure I can even bring myself to read one of her earlier works, to see why the popularity of the books.  I think she just turned this book out, fast, thinking it would sell, no matter what -- and she was right, the book is selling.  But it is a bad book -- if I could rate it less than 1 star, I would.",0,0,0,0
R1TZDLZ8IA4J2,"The other reviews are accurate - it DOES pick up pet hair and lint, but really not as effectively as a tape roller. It's not that sticky, so it misses things and you have to roll it back and forth several times. You also have to rinse it off and dry it frequently during use. To get the pet hair off my couch, I had to rinse it at least 7 times and I still had hairs left over, and my cat doesn't shed nearly as much as others. The product photos are definitely not accurate - there's no way it could pick up that type of thick pet dander and leave the surface below completely clean like it shows. That's blatant false advertising. It's really just not that effective, but I guess it's something you could have laying around if you just needed to take a quick swipe of something minor.

R1J9JN83JVHZ1S,"First things first:  This unit is more like a thermal wax transfer printer (for those of you old enough to remember those) than a laser. I didn't know this until after I bought it and read that it puts down a thin layer of wax to create colors. When crinkled, you can see the wax ""crack"" or wear down. True laser printers don't use wax. Okay, not that huge of a deal breaker because of the low price.But then there's the question of how economical it is to keep.  The replacement toner cartridges cost more than the unit itself. Other reviews talked about how it drains power out of the sockets - it's totally true! Our computer room has 4 breakers, with the overhead fan/light & desk lamps on the lowest powered one (the original - we added the rest). The first time I turned it on, ALL of the lights flickered for more than a few seconds. When you power it up or print to it, it sucks the electricity right out of the wall! That can't be good news for when our electric bill comes.It is very slow to print, which is acceptable considering the price.  The wireless networking feature doesn't work like it's supposed to, and we tried every which way to set it up.One major annoyance is that I lose the device status/connectivity every time I shut down or reboot my pc.  We've got it hardwired to the network, and everything's perfectly fine until I have to reboot/power down my computer. When I power back up, the device shows as being ""Offline"", even though the printer is on. The printer is still listed under ""Devices & Printers"", but until I reinstall it, it will continue to show it as offline.But, if you don't mind the power drain, wax transfer, high replacement toner cost, and using the printer directly connected to your pc via usb, it's definitely the printer to buy.

R2R637LIEYS4R5,"When this file cabinet arrived, one of the interior guide rails was dislocated. This caused the cabinet to wobble like a balloon animal, and prevented any drawers from shutting all the way until I found the problem (by completely removing the top drawer) and fixed it. It was a fairly easy fix, which only makes me ask why they didn't do it before they shipped it.I would have considered the dislocated piece a small oversight, or maybe something that occurred during shipping, except the cabinet is also about 1/2 inch too short on one side at the bottom. Shipping didn't do that. Despite being on a flat-tile floor, it leans considerably, so it has to be propped up with a wooden splint. Fortunately I only planned to shut this in a closet anyway, so I don't have to look at it. I wasn't expecting this to be top-of-the-line, but for $200+ I do expect it to at least be square.I gave it 2 stars because it does function as a file cabinet, and it hasn't fallen apart.

R26XOJABXA4QHS,"Purchased these labels (#41567 1 1/2"" x 1 1/2"" Square Kraft Labels) and regret every minute of it. Although they look nice, I couldn't get the Avery template to work with them. Tried as I may, I couldn't get the template to line up with the labels when printing. I have never had this happen with other Avery label products, but these are a nightmare. As others have stated, they come in a 4 x 6 sized sheet and had they been in a traditional 8 x 11 sheet, maybe that would be better. Paying $12 for 60 labels is steep, but if the company template works with their product, not a problem. If you waste half of them trying to print the product with the company's template, it's a rip off. I gave up trying after 3 sheets were wasted. Sadly, I couldn't use them with my project. Be aware that this could happen to you.Oh, and I find it interesting that all the positive 5 star comments are from people who were given the product for FREE. I paid through the nose for mine, and think there is room for major improvement. I found kraft labels on an 8 x 11 sheet (24 labels/sheet) for mere pennies compared to these at OnlineLabels.com. You can order labels by the sheet if you wish, and I got 240 labels for UNDER the Avery price here. Save your money and DON'T support Avery since they seem to have a disconnect with the consumers.",1,1,0,1
RN67J2EJCW0TG,"So I had a 'Heavy Duty' chair I got on sale a couple of years back, and I love it. The piston went bad about a year ago, which wasn't a big deal, but then the base became broken a few months ago as well, which made it very wobbly. I bought a new piston and base at the same time because the rest of the chair was still in excellent shape. The piston was rated at 1000 lbs. The base (the product I am reviewing here) was rated at 500 lbs. My original chair was rated at 330 lbs, and boy was that accurate - right after it broke I weighed myself and sure enough I was just TWO lbs over! So I bought what I thought was even better parts than my original, fixed it, and it was great... for two weeks. It became wobbly again, but I ignored it, and last night the chair literally broke off and I ended up on the floor (I am both large AND old, so it HURT). Apparently the metal tore like tissue paper. My old base (OEM) was rated at 2/3 that, and I got almost three years out of it. The 500 lbs rating is BS, and I am VERY dissatisfied (Because now I have to replace it again, and I am very annoyed about that). If your as big as me or bigger, look for another brand - this one is made terrible. I am going to try and track down a replacement OEM part this time (the piston, on the other hand, seems to be holding up fine). Oh, and the pivot lock mechanism only lasted two days!",0,0,0,0

RCCIB8V1KDESE,"I rented and viewed ""The Day After Tomorrow"" recently.I was bored throughout and would have simply turned it off and hit ""rewind"", had I not paid to see the movie.I had read nothing but negative reviews of ""The Day After Tomorrow"" and had rented it with the intention of setting straight those who were so critical of a movie depicting the nightmare worst case scenario of global warming--something I consider to be a real possibility.Sadly, I must now join the chorus of critics of Roland Emmerich's latest cliche-ridden disaster flick.The film is characterized by a suffocating concoction of dauntless American heroism and sappy traditional home and family values rubbed into the viewer's nose ad nauseum--a reflection, no doubt, of the mood now prevalent in this nation.There is also excessive Hollywood style special effect sock, bang and pow noise and violence where a thoughtful examination of the very real issue of global warming might have been more helpful.Additionally, as per Hollywood's stock in trade formula, inordinately intelligent African Americans spout endless profundities, while no Native American, Hispanic or Arab American says or does anything noteworthy.There is even a quasi-supernatural demonization of escaped zoo wolves at one point to further annoy the thoughtful viewer.And a child-like PG 13 rendition of a sanitized hand-holding romance between two brainy students is as near as the movie comes to anything romantic.Global warming is a serious and pressing problem for the human species--one made more so by the Bush administration's refusal to sign the Kyoto Protocol.But Emmerich's ""The Day After Tomorrow""--a movie that could have been a great teaching tool--so trivializes the issue that the cause of enlightenment about the perils of global warming may have been done more harm than good.I was very disappointed by ""The Day After Tomorrow"".D.

I don't have a windows pc. I have a chromebook.Kevin P: As we are unable to print from cloud printing, we need to update the firmware and we need a windows PC to update the firmware of the printer to print wirelessly from cloud printing.Visitor: so Samsung sold me a ""cloud ready"" printer advertised to work with my specific laptop that is not, in fact, cloud ready, and will not, in fact, work with my laptop without the presence of an additional computer?Kevin P: I understand your concern, we need an additional computer only to setup the wireless cloud printing on the printer.Kevin P: Once we setup the printer, we print wirelessly without any additional computer.Visitor: well, I have no other computer.

R127F55AR85NAM,"Relative to other debuts and the usual dreck in the historical-fiction/mystery/thriller/suspense arenas, I would rate this book at 2-2.5 stars. Just the idea of it (on the trail of a serial killer in Stalinist Russia) is worth a star. Kudos on the ambition and treading new ground.Relative to my expectations, however, I am having a hard time giving it a single star. Having read the gushing reviews, I thought I was in for a rare treat. I was wrong. In fact, far from rare...the writing here is common. There is nothing particularly artful or engaging about the narrative style. The dialogue is stiff.Apart from some minimal nuance granted the leads, most characters are entirely one-dimensional. And even the leads are just barely sympathetic. I understand that the setting of the story is a time and place of great oppression, with fear and paranoia ruling the day. But here there is such a sheer lack of humanity on display that I came to expect that each new adult character introduced would be not just cold, but an outright sadist. And that is not to say that I have a problem with any of the violence. With themes of a serial killer and Stalin's Soviet Union, one should expect the journey to be grim. But here it was comically so.As I wrote earlier, I appreciated the broad strokes of the plot and felt there was some real potential. I read it eagerly. But, as is all too often the case in the genre, the author relied too heavily on coincidence to advance the story. Anyone who is expecting any engaging detective work will not find it here. The absolute height of the detective work on display is some dots on a map.[Warning: the mildest of spoilers ahead]The resolution is completely unsatisfying. And not just the final confrontation with the killer, but also the aftermath. After a long hard slog where no good deed goes unpunished and where no righteous man or woman can be expected to survive, we are fed a tidy little ending where EVERYTHING turns out right. I will admit that I was in dire need of a ray of sunshine by the end, but I found the brightness of it to be so incongruous with the rest of the book as to be laughable.Which brings me back to the infuriating praise. Picking one shining example out of the thousands, I'll quote Robert Towne (writer/screenwriter of ""Chinatown"") from the jacket: ""Achingly suspenseful, full of feeling and the twists and turns that one expects from le Carré at his best...""At his BEST. Le Carré, with his genius for plotting and awesome command of the English language and ability to render even the most minor of characters in full. I would love for Mr. Towne to look John le Carré in the eye and tell him in all sincerity that the plotting of this unremarkable debut novel is on par with the best work he's ever done -- with the likes of ""The Spy Who Came in From the Cold"" or ""Tinker Tailor.""  That is preposterous. I know authors throw around quotes of praise like bird feed, but sometimes it is just so far off base that I can't ignore it.I don't want to be unfair to the author, blaming him for others' reviews. As I said, if I came into this with no expectations I would give it a couple of stars. The idea was a good one. And this is his first work. I had similar lukewarm feelings about Jo Nesbø's ""The Bat"" and his Harry Hole detective series has come to be a favorite of mine. So, as I have nothing else on my radar at the moment, I am going to  stick with Tom Rob Smith and see if he has grown with his second and third installment. I hope so.",0,0,0,0
R2IP0NMLCFB57,"I had high expectations for this movie, but it ended up being a major failure. It was also boring. Seeing boring and Steve Carell in the same sentence is not something you see everyday. He has a proven track record of enjoyable movies such as The 40 Year Old Virgin, Over The Hedge, Little Miss Sunshine, Dan In Real Life, Get Smart, Evan Almighty, Horton Hears A Who!, Despicable Me, and Dinner For Schmucks. I was expecting this movie to be on that same level. But it failed to accomplish that. The speech during the graduation by Cal (Carell) seemed forced and awkward. Other than that, Carell's performance wasn't bad. But his best dramedy character is Dan Burns in the movie Dan In Real Life. Julianne Moore's character is easily forgettable. For a memorable Julianne Moore character, check out Freedomland. Emma Stone is also a forgettable character here. Ryan Goseling is the latest one to strike while the iron is hot, being in 3 awful or easy to forget movies that came out in 2011. Those movies being this, Drive, and The Ides Of March. Goseling gets somewhat of a pass because he's in Remember The Titans and I like that movie. I love Marissa Tomei and I was disappointed that her role was a bit part. She's clearly the stand out character of this movie. Kevin Bacon as the romantic antagonist David Lindhagen, is rather light weight. He's not sinister enough in his role. The whole boy and baby sitter subplot was really awkward and creepy. His public displays of love were way over the top, the babysitter's crush on Cal is creepy, the pics the babysitter sends Cal are creepy, and the boy's speech is very unrealistic. And to ask the same question another reviewer asked: why does a 13 year old need a baby sitter? I could see him needing a baby sitter if he were 10. But not at 13.

R35HKPK37NACLX,"Like a typewriter stuck on one letter, this book is full of similes.  As repetitive as a woodpecker working on an old oaken log, this book is full of similes.  If you enjoy similes like a dog enjoys scratching his fleas, then you may find this book entertaining.Like a freshman English professor tired of reading excessive adjectives in assignments, I did not.I too stuck it through to the very end, wading through the tedious and verbose prose; probably more because I'm stubborn (and always finish my books) and not due to the fact that I was enjoying the read.The storyline, though sometimes confusing, was above average.  It almost begs a sequel.

R2EWCQI7XYOCXZ,"Arthur C. Clarke's ""Childhood's End"" is an interesting book.  But, unfortunately, Clarke spends far, far too much of it describing things instead of letting us pick up what he's trying to say via action or even dialog.  What we end up with is a story that feels very sparse because it's floating in a vast sea of descriptive text and philosophy.  I suppose that would have been tolerable if the story he relates were a bit more positive.  But, the best that can be said of it is that it's interesting and thought-provoking.  So, all I can do is rate the book is a Not Very Good 2 stars out of 5.",0,0,0,0
R3GZ30CZVD94CK,"I had to read this book for a college, Chinese History class. I still remember how 'ethnocentric' it is. He bragged about how he could beat these poor, backward, malnourished Chinese people in a foot race. I guess he didn't forsee that the Chinese would sweep the Beijing Olympics with an astonishing amount of medals. He also talked about 'Chinese propaganda signs' as if his culture didn't have anti-smoking commercials and other various forms of 'propaganda'. Really, this book was written by an angry 20 some thing year old who cared more about puffing up his own ego than any kind of deep understanding  of a foreign culture.  It's just a shame that this guy had a successful  career as a journalist. The fact that this book was so popular shows the tribe state of journalism and intellectuallism in the usa.

R1022S7JFH09H,"I don't normally post reviews of books that I haven't read recently. But two or three years after reading ""Their Eyes Were Watching God"" in my African American Literature Class, my feelings on it are still so strong that I just have to make them known somewhere.Overall, the writing style wasn't bad, and was pretty and poetic at times. The story wasn't bad; a bit dull, but still had interesting moments. My problem with this book was the protagonist, Janie. Now if Janie were a real person, of course I'd sympathize with her troubles.  But knowing she was created by an author who wanted to make a statement about race, I feel that the way the protagonist was presented was obnoxious.Janie's plight stems from the fact that she is 3/4 white, but lives in the African American community in the days of instituted racism. All right, I understand how upsetting that must be for such a person; to be resented by other blacks, but still not ""white"" enough to be treated as an equal by white people; to know that white blood got into your family through rape. Janie's plight, in that sense, is very sympathetic. That being said, I got very tired very quickly of hearing about what a curse Janie's ""beauty"" was. How all the men wanted her, how all the women were jealous of her, because her pale skin and strait here were just soooo much more beautiful than regular African American features. That offended me, and I'm not even black...I'm white! Maybe I was just offended as a woman; I don't care to hear about the pains of being ""too beautiful"" and how ""being popular is so exhausting!"" I sympathized much more with Janie's dark-skinned bullies than with Janie.I'll admit that my distaste for this book may be more my own fault than the author's. I sympathize with underdogs more than with the people who are ""lonely at the top."" So I'll say that this book isn't necessarily bad; but if you're looking for a book about plights of people at the bottom of the social ladder, this will not satisfy.",0,0,0,0

R1WSJFJ3L7JR7Z,"There are pieces of this work that are riveting, relevant, and highly cognizant of aspects of the human condition that are rarely explored. However, unless you like constant digressions into the stuff of dreamland, where digging out the story is a near Herculean task, where you need an encyclopedic knowledge of obscure cultural references, and have a fair working knowledge of both German and the facts of the German rocket operation of WWII, this book is not for you.Starting from a rather different portrait of London at the beginning of the V1 and V2 attacks, it becomes immediately obvious that this is not a standard novel with clear-cut protagonists and structure. The characters introduced here are not your everyday people, as many are imbued with (possible) extra-sensory talents, such as one that makes sure the individual is never at the place where one of those rockets lands (at a near random place within London, but which follows a well known mathematical distribution). Nor is the organization one you have ever heard of, and its relationship to the top level power structure is Byzantine, something that becomes important to understanding the later stages of this work.At the beginning of Part 2, we begin following the actions and adventures of one Slothrop, and the main focus of the work starts to come into view, as he diligently (for him) follows the clues to the design and fabrication of the A4 rocket, serial number 00000, and Impolex G, a new plastic of wondrous properties. This search will lead Slothrop to many corners of post-WWII Europe, and his obsessions, James Bondian actions, and just who he is underneath all his many guises and disguises forms the basic scaffold of the book's theme of paranoia run rampant, of the symbol of the rocket as a metaphor for both individual lives and that of multiple cultures.All of this is buried in constant digressions from `reality' in often page-long sentences that drift inevitably towards the stuff of dreams and pure non-sense. Many times these digressions do paint images, sometimes quite forceful, a few beautiful, but many degrade into the pornographic and extremely gross (be warned! - I'm not easily disturbed by such things, but I found many of these just flatly beyond the pale). There are many poems, ditties, and `songs' in the later half that are nothing but bad doggerel, and do little to advance either theme or plot. There is a fair amount of un-translated German here, understanding of which is frequently important (happily I have a fair understanding of the language). The total cast of characters is quite large, and remembering who is who is quite a task. In short, digging out the gold in this work is not easy, and clearly the work could have been improved by a large amount of cutting of the `extraneous' material.Still, there are pieces of this work that are illuminating, with themes and symbolism not frequently encountered, and sometimes the prose lifts to the realm of true poetry. Whether these aspects are enough to justify the effort of reading this is questionable, and probably depends on the individual reader's tolerance or liking of such things.---Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)",0,0,0,0

R8ENJ1OK9VDLM,"I am an elementary school teacher, and I thought that these Dr. Seuss Valentines would be perfect for my students. At $14.97, I also thought that they would be substantial. As I wasn't able to see what an individual card looked like, I thought that for $14.97 the cards would be small individual cards in separate envelopes. In the least I expected to get a high quality, glossy card (even without an envelope) to give to the kids.What came in the box was described best by one of my fellow teachers who said that the Valentines looked as if they came from the Dollar Store. They truly are no better than cards purchased at the Dollar Store. For $14.97 they are cheap, tear-part cards...the cards that didn't even fold over. I'm not sure if it is Paper Magic who has grossly overpriced this item or if it a royalty issue with the estate of 'Dr. Seuss.' Either way, someone is making a lot of money off of this, and it really is shameful.After thinking about it I decided not to give these to my students.

R1QF83V9C27INE,"This review reflects my experience with Amazon.  I have owned the non-lip version of this mat for about 2 years and I think its the best mat I've used.  I decided to buy this one on Amazon because I wanted to protect my floor directly under my desk from my trampling feet while gaming.  I read several reviews about how it ships rolled up and is difficult to unroll.I decided to roll the dice and order it, because I am fairly certain most of the reviewers did not go to the ES Robbins site or youtube channels that state you should lay it flat for 24+ hours before using it.  I was happy to see that my mat arrived shipped flat, however it was in giant plastic...envelope?  that had many rips and tears.  My woes started when I saw that there was an orange tape used to seal the envelope.  The tape also was on the end of the lip and rear of the mat, because the envelope was clearly not large enough to house the entire mat and seal it.  The orange tape was very difficult to rip off and left tons of orange residue on the mat.  I spent about an hour with a roll of paper towels, GooGone, and soap/water removing all of the residue.  There is still slight bits of orange coloring around a few of the anchor bars, and I can only hope that my carpet doesn't get stains from it...  I wonder what person decided that sticky tape directly on a chair mat was a good idea, especially since its going to be on carpet 24/7...Again, I want to say that my review is from my experience with Amazon.

RA5S9W8GR4KWJ,"I'm so disappointed with Strathmore. I've bought their cards in the past and pulled out some old work to compare when i noticed how awful this product was.  The old product was classic 140 pound cold press texture.  This one... well-- just wait until you actually put paint on the paper.  It dries into a weird texture that looks like corduroy material (see image.  Zoom in). Every single card in my 100 count box has this awful kind of tilted cord texture. It doesn't absorb water,  the water just floats until it's murky. The pigments won't blend.  It reminds me of years ago when I had a case of half sheets that were run over by a truck.  Literally tire tread marks appeared in the paint.  That's exactly what this looks like but with tiny little treads everywhere.

RCTDPU34ZLZ3H,I recently purchased this item not knowing what to expect like many other readers. Luckily it is available from Amazon with free postage return because you are likely to want to return it. I initially persevered starting off with scanning 110mm negative. The results were very poor. Even on the highest resolution scan the results looked like something from a John Bull printing press from the 1960's. The results with the 35mm negatives were better and occasionally reasonably acceptable. I consider that I wasted a lot of time scanning in negatives that I feel I will have to do all over again. One other really annoying thin about this device is the fact that the light has an inconsistent spread. In the centre of the slide you can see a dark circle and around the corners the scanned copy is brighter. You can notice this particularly when reviewing the slide window without a slide in place. Save yourself the time and go for something that has consistently good reviews. Bear in mind that you do not know how good the scans could be with a better unit. I will put a comment on Amazon if I find one which performs well.,0,0,0,0

What about ""Bargain"", even if this disk was free it would still be a rip off!! The cover of Bizkit's Behind Blue Eyes was weak, Peter Denis can't hokld a candle to Fred Dursts vocal.  I liked the meaning behind ""Won't get fooled Again"" cuz I will never be fooled to play this unremarkable music by cheesy geezers from the sixties!!

R3RFS4PU8B77W7,"After reading mixed reviews I decided to borrow this ebook from the library instead of buying it. I am so glad I did because it would have been a total waste of money. Let's not even talk about the time wasted reading this book. I am perplexed by the good reviews on amazon as there is nothing good about this book. Not the story, not the characters, not the style of writing.As others have mentioned I was not a fan of each chapter jumping to different characters you have not been introduced to as well as different time periods. You make no personal connection to any of the characters because they are only with you for one chapter and then it is on to the next character. I was really hoping towards the end the author would tie them all together and end the book in some great and unexpected way but no, that never happened. You get one chapter and that is it.Overall the story is boring and uneventful. You know a book is bad when you find yourself skimming through all the useless filler to simply try to get through the book. I finished this book in three days, not because it was so good I couldn't put it down but just because I do not like to read books half through. It felt like homework to try to get through it and finish it. Skip this dud!!",0,0,1,1
R13UKHKMPVZEK3,"The problem with this prequel, or almost ANY prequel for that matter, is that, while working to fill in backstory for the fans, the fans already have an idea of how things will turn out in order to lead up to the  original series, thereby giving no real payoff within the prequel itself -  the story, therefore, is very paint-by-numbers.In order to attact the  attention of new readers, however, another disservice is done: ""House  Attreides"" is written in a simplistic fashion to provide new readers  with essential info, and this insults the intelligence of those who have  followed the original series.After reading this story, I shudder to  think that someone may mistakenly begin reading the Dune series with  ""House Attreides"" instead of ""Dune"".  I would never  recommend this book to a newcomer OR a long-time Frank Herbert fan.  It is  too simplistically written, and I agree with a prior reviewer who stated  that it was written on the same level as Kevin Anderson's ""Young  Jedi"" series.  This book is not mature nor challenging; it doesn't  have near the heart or ambition of the original series.The most  irritating point of the book for me is how it is peppered with the  characters wondering about the secret of the spice.  Well, any fan of  ""Dune"" knows the answer, and while this is designed to give a  sense of plot development to new readers, this technique is pretty cheesy  and falls flat on its face for fans.On one hand, I can't believe that  the story of Dune would be polluted with this mess.  On the other hand, I  *can* understand it ($$$).  Don't bother with this book.",0,0,0,0

The book to me lacked the angst and struggle of a buildup to what makes the YA novels good. Sure there was a little back and forth banter with herself and how she would move past her state of mind and move forward, but there was never any with withdrawal or longing that made you sit on the end of your seat waiting to turn to the next page. Not at all like a Beautiful Disaster, with this crazy insane ""connection"" the author kept referring to. I actually found myself skimming the book a lot trying to move past all the overload of detail that in the end didn't really matter to the story. I wanted to put it down a lot but I made myself finish it, because I paid $2.99 for it, I know that is not a lot but I can't stand wasting money. The detail at time would make me forget about the scene at hand because you were busy reading about the room they were in. I really just expected more I guess. I feel like there was a lot of filler with a so-so story.

R1HXEWKLCT87T1,"I bought this off of Amazon from seller orderinstant(USA), in November 2012.Wrong item was sent to me. The item I purchased was supposed to be brand new in original packaging.Instead, I received a refurbished version with the wrong box.I ordered the Nokia 6700 Classic Gold Edition Unlocked Cell Cellular Mobile Phone.When I looked at the phone inside I could tell that someone was tampering with its internal parts and the label with the UPC code was changed.It was obviously a refurbished phone. They may have as well put a golden body on top of a regular 6700 Nokia (most of them are not the Golden edition).So I could not be sure if it actually is the Golden edition, plus it was supposed to be brand new. One of the sides of the phone could not snap back properly to its place also. And last, but not least, the phone sis not come in the original box. The box was of a regular 6700 Nokia - white in color, but the original box does say'Nokia 6700 Classic Gold Edition' on it and it should be all black color (I'm talking about the color of the box here). Also 2 of the original accessories were missing - the pouch and the something else, I forgot. You can google 'Nokia 6700 Classic Gold Edition' and see how the box should look like and what accessories should be included inside. There are some unboxing video reviews in YouTube too.I contacted the seller for a refund. The seller responded to all my emails and accepted a return.I did not pay for return shipping. The seller sent me a label, which I printed. After they received the item, they refunded me.I was not happy with the item, as it was refurbished (tampered with) and in the wrong box (and some missing accessories), but I overall I am happy with the seller!

R1IVI7DUKHXGJH,"I've never given a 1-star review before, but I'm so completely disappointed in this product that I just had to this time.This stapler made a lot of sense to me -- the downward force when stapling is smack dab on top of where the staple (or brad) fires. This virtually eliminates kick-back and lands the staple solidly on target. It's pretty straightforward and only mildly awkward once you get used to the idea (which happens pretty quickly) - you just have to keep in mind that you're using a stapler that fires from ""the other end."" (Side note: Personally I don't try to operate any tool without understanding its basic operation, including what's sharp, what moves, and how the tool might react when used. This is especially true for those tools that fire _projectiles_, so follow this advice and you probably won't wind up with a staple in your hand... or worse.)I say ""mildly awkward,"" by the way, because I think when we (people in general) put force into a push, we're accustomed to using the heels of our palms - right in line with the forearm. That's more in line with how the traditional staple guns work. With this one, though, you kind of have to rock your wrist forward when you squeeze. It's as if you're pushing from the area between your thumb and first finger, which feels a bit unnatural.Anyway, I bought this stapler, a package of brad nails (same brand) and a package of staples (again, same brand). The staples fired about 80% of the time; the brads about 70%. I shot about 50 of each before the first jam (on a staple). I managed to get it cleared and shot about 15 more staples before it jammed again... then again, and again. Between misfires and jams, this product was really slowing me down. Finally ""something gave"" inside and the handle went limp. I don't think it was jammed - I think it just plain old broke because something was rattling inside. And the duty was light, too - by this time I was simply firing staples into a 2x4 to get a better idea of how often it actually worked. ANd I was careful not to hit another staple.So I returned it and got a replacement. With roughly the same rate of misfire, I was already disappointed, and after the third or fourth jam, it simply would not clear. The handle felt limp again, but not like before - it felt as if the gun were cocked and ready to fire, but just not firing - and of course there was no way I was going to look ""down the barrel"" to see what might be wrong. The jam wouldn't budge.So I returned it and got a replacement - again. Long story short: same problems. I'm totally disenchanted. I had carefully read and followed the instructions (which, by the way, mentioned how uncommonly rare it would be for the product to ever jam), I used only brads and staples of the same brand, and the target was only relatively soft 2x4 pine.And so my only 1-star review to date... Based on my experience, I advise against this product full heartedly.",0,0,0,0

R168I24AW3J4OP,"Embattled Rebel is a big disappointment. Short on analysis and short on interpretation one can hardly credit this is written by the author of Battle Cry of Freedom and Tried By War.  At a mere 250 pages (with 50 blank, photos or battle maps) James McPherson apparently has little to say about a subject others have written volumes: Jefferson Davis' role as commander in chief of the Confederate Rebellion.Indeed, Embattled Rebel has us careening through Civil War battles and campaigns at a dizzying pace.  Imagine touring Gettysburg with a NASCAR driver and you get a sense of reading McPherson's latest effort.  Antietam--3 pages (plus 1 map and a photo of R.E. Lee), Gettysburg--4 pages (plus one map).  Sherman's Atlanta Campaign a whopping 8 pages with a single map.  It took General Sherman longer to put on the boots that marched through Georgia then it did for Jim McPherson to write about his campaign.McPherson, seems blithely unaware his colleagues have devoted entire books to single battles.  Jeff Davis' contribution to Gettysburg doesn't merit a dozen paragraphs.  If that is true, this book needn't be written.  If untrue it is badly written.  The factual information in it reads more like Jeff Davis' Wiki page than historical analysis.  Jeff Davis begins Embattled Rebel sickly, arrogant, haughty and admired. He ends it sickly, arrogant, haughty and despised.  Thanks for the update, but is that really worth $25.00?In a positively loopy introduction McPherson advises, in the spirit of ""full disclosure"" his sympathies have always been....wait for it....with the Union!  Phew.  For a moment I thought America's premier Civil War historian was going to admit to supporting secession or hankering after a slave or two.  Fifteen years into the 21st century, EVERY decent human being's sympathies are pro-Union, anti-slavery, Mr. McP.  Full disclosure seems hardly necessary, so back to the book.The introduction natters on quoting scathing indictments of Davis' character and ability by Robert Toombs, Pierre Beauregard and Linton Stephens.  McPherson is happy to report he discovered the subject of his book wasn't as bad as all that--as though this is news.  No reputable historian looks to a subject's enemies for character reference, so what precisely McPherson's point was remains a mystery.More disturbing though and perhaps the greatest flaw in Embattled Rebel is a refusal to compare Davis to Lincoln because the latter had a tremendous material advantage in winning the war. Nobody doubts such an advantage.  But by omitting comparison, McPherson refuses to consider, not whether Davis should have WON the war, but whether he should have grown, and matured and evolved, which Abraham Lincoln certainly did and Jefferson Davis certainly did not.This is a serious and hugely disappointing omission. How could any man go through the ""fiery trial"" Davis endured and come out the other side the same serenely smug and condescending stiff-neck?  How and why the Confederate President manages such an unenviable feat is never examined or considered.  At the end of the war we are left with a half-mad ideologue exhorting the population to continue to sacrifice, continue to die for a cause that everyone but he knows is lost.  How and why he deludes himself so completely is unconsidered.McPherson seems unaware that great leaders (Washington, Lincoln, Roosevelt, Regan) are required to not only make decisions, but to inspire and convince.  In the latter two categories Jefferson Davis was a miserable, divisive failure, but the author is loathe say so.  Indeed the tragedy of his life is not that he was unfit for office, but that he was seemingly the perfect man for the job.  Between resumes and reality lies a vast chasm which Jefferson Davis fell through.I was fortunate to receive a reviewer's copy of Embattled Rebel.  If I had laid out $20-$25 for this meager work I would be really, really annoyed.  Unless you're dying to make a contribution to the James McPherson retirement fund (not an unworthy cause) I would suggest your local public library.",0,0,0,0

R19WQ6IWZ203ME,"I found two faults which wasted a lot of expensively printed paper - and then I looked at the critical reviews. I should have looked before ordering but I mistakenly thought that at the high price it should be the best.I confirm the design defects which have been reported by other reviewers:1) This stapler is not suitable for a brochure comprising two or three sheets of paper which are to be folded to create a 4 or 8 page booklet. The reason for this is that there is always one leg of the staple which gets folded too far, pushing it back through so that it protrudes through the spine of the booklet. If you don't mind being restricted to producing booklets with more than 12 pages then this first defect may or may not apply. However, by the time I had wasted hours printing and destroying brochures due to the staplers ineptness I had no motivation to experiment with more sheets to see how many it needed before it did what it was supposed to do.2) The guide does not hold it's position.

RZ38WBYSDSW1K,"This book got off to a very bad start.  The first paragraph, (the THIRD SENTENCE!), contains a glaring error.  Shifting gears on a motorcycle is done using the left foot, not the right foot.  If the authors are going to go into details on the fluid grace that is a proper motorcycle gear change, they should at least ask someone who has ridden a motorcycle to review what they have written.  This kind of error is inexcusable, in my opinion.  In all fairness, in general the technical details of this sort were much better than in many other books I have read.The book suffered a bit from bad dialog.  For example:  ""Accident, my cute behind,"" said Molly.  Who talks like that about a murdered friend?  Accident, my a$$ would be a bit more believable.Overall, I thought the book was pretty good, up until the trial section.  That part of the book was so implausible that it required a concerted effort not to burst out laughing at the absurdity.  Some examples:-One of Jack's high school classmates just happened to be a medical examiner who was able to examine his brother's body.  She finished college, finished medical school, did her internship, worked in a clinic, and then became a county medical examiner, skilled at doing autopsies, all by the ripe old age of 29.  Nice career so far.-The ability to keep the police and FBI from tracking down the source of a live broadcast for two days is ludicrous.-The idea that the three or four accomplices in the kidnapping could get off scot-free is ridiculous.  The accomplices were Jack's best friends, and the police and FBI couldn't figure who they were?  The premise was that the kidnapping victims were so upset about the whole affair they wouldn't be able to identify them.  Ridiculous.-On a similar note, one of the kidnapping victims says in the live broadcast that they were transported in a milk delivery truck.  How many milk delivery trucks could there be in the area?  And one of Jack's best friends is now working as a milk delivery driver.  Nope, the FBI couldn't crack that mystery.-The ending was like that of a cheesy, feel-good, made-for-TV movie, as other reviewers have said.This is far from the worst book I ever read, which is Babylon Rising.  (Beach House is like a literary masterpiece compared to that piece of printed puke.)The book might be worth a read, but is not worth spending any money on it.  Borrow it, don't buy it.",0,0,0,0

But the main problem I had with this film is the same problem I always seem to have with R rated films:  They would be as good or better if they were PG.  There is no subtlety in filmmaking these days.  As if I couldn't tell the characters were having sex unless I actually see their legs in the air and their bare ugly asses.  For some reason film directors have a need to shock us with pornographic images.  The depictions od sex in this film weren't as graphic as what you often see, but they were totally unnecessary.  Same goes for the drug use.  Is getting the R rating really that important?But besides that, there was, as I said plenty to dislike about the characters.  I will break with many of the other negative reviews at a certain point.

Speakman makes Burkett a rich offer that Burkett is happy to accept.  Within hours, Burkett is out visiting his favorite madam.  A little after that, the madam faces some brutal facts . . . Burkett is a marked man who is scheduled to be taken down by Stanley Rodarte, a man who wants to pin a murder on Burkett and recover a fortune in hidden loot.As Burkett holds up his end of the deal, he's profoundly uncomfortable with his role as in-person sperm donor for Foster Speakman's wife, Laura.  As time passes, the circumstances get worse until Burkett finds himself friendless and on the run.There's a mystery here that is gradually revealed:  Why did the Speakmans want Burkett as the father of their child?

R17X8P49CUELNM,"Although it prints fast, the color pics I printed were not as good as the cheapest Dell inkjet I have. But the reason I could not rate this printer above a 1 is because of the way that Brother forces you to buy all of the color cartridges just to be able to use the printer once their ink is low or out if you make the mistake or removing a color cartridge. I felt like I was being held from being able to print my tax returns until I purchased new cartridges. I realize there are ""hacks"" online to get around some of these issues but none worked for me. I first purchased a black cartridge since I really only needed Black for now. I made sure it was genuine Innobella. One I replaced it, still same crappy print job. I following instructions from Brother to select gray-scale in the preferences, clean the jets, etc. Didn't work either. Unplugged it etc. Then I made the mistake of removing one of the color cartridges to shake it hoping to fool the sensors since they ask you to shake the new ones before installation. When I replaced the cartridge, it would no longer recognize the cartridge. At that point it would no longer print unless I could fix that error. Worked all day on ""hacks"" until I finally broke down and ordered another set of color cartridges from Amazon,  I made sure they was genuine Innobella. Thankfully I received them in two days to get my returns printed. However print quality is still not good even after cleaning the jets three times. I would never buy another Brother product again because this issue cost me almost $100 of money I didn't have to spend this month with still inferior print jobs.",0,0,0,0

The scriptwriters of this story chose to do nothing with them - we leave them as we met them.  Perhaps in comedy the prop of the ""unlikely duo"" can be a source of laughs and lightness when done right, but in this case, the two characters have the most unbelievable of friendships.  Supposedly these two have been friends for many many years, since freshman year of college.  Miles is to be the best man at Jack's wedding.  And yet, it is clear that they don't know each other, don't know how to be with each other, don't know how to act around each other.  It is not even clear that they enjoy each other's company very much.  The only way way Miles could be Jack's best man is if Jack doesn't have any other friends - which, by the way, may be true, since Jack is such a monster of a person; but why would Miles want to be Jack's friend?  I am still trying to figure that one out.One last comment about the women: it is amazing how one-dimensional the women of this movie are.  Women are, in this movie, those things we men pursue.  Oh, and they don't like it when we are dishonest with them.  And they often have baggage, like these things called ""children"" whose photos appear on refrigerator doors and who are always either asleep in the next room or away at grandma's for the weekend.  And sometimes they can be good conversationalists, indulging us men in the things we care about most and telling us when we need to hear it how amazing we are.  That is about as much character development as the women characters get in this movie.  This is a movie about the men and their ""pains"".  Women are, as I mention above, just stage props for propelling the men's story along.  I found this disappointing, especially since I found the men of this movie to be so pathetic.",0,0,0,0

No, it's exactly like everyone says. When I first put it on it smelled like Bubble Yum bubble gum which was a turn off in itself. After I got out of the bed the smell really did change to a sweet buttered popcorn smell, no lie! My boyfriend thought it smelled more like butterscotch, either way it isn't pleasant. If tanning lotion smells don't bother you at all it might be a good choice. Personally, the smell made me nauseous. Great seller though, would by from them again any day!",0,0,0,0
RSXTQ6WSN0WCA,"I have been using Neat Receipts for some time and was generally pleased with it, although it was slow and frequently did a poor job of recognizing the information on receipts.It was always necessary to manually edit every receipt to insure that the information was correct.I was never able to get it to integrate with any other software like Quicken, so whatever was scanned in just generally sat in the Neat database.Just recently I was prompted that an update was available so I downloaded it and tried to install the update. I had done this before without too much trouble.Upon trying to open the program I kept getting the error message “Neat has stopped workingWindows can check online for a solution to the problemCheck for Online SolutionOr Close the program""So this time the installation failed and it took me 2 days to finally get the software to install correctly and open.

R355Y3QGCW2VYY,"This work actually makes little or no sense unless you know the codes and the metaphors - and anyone who does isn't admitting it, not that I know of. Do you?The Emerald Tablets and the Hermetica are entirely written in coded metaphors. For instance, God is the thesis or the creator, Kosmos the antithesis or the destroyer, and Space the synthesis between the first two or the preserver. They are a kind of metaphysical and dialectic version of topological triangulation. This is paralleled in the doctrine of the Trinity. Each vertex may also be described geometrically as a set of functions or their opposites. The Hermetica is really coded physics - and not the physics conventionally taught in our schools and universities but rather a hidden physics.I myself have not learned much more than this very basic and simplistic code for a small part of the Hermetica. I also know there are at least 3 levels: the topological metaphor of the physical (deepest), the physics metaphor of the emergence of creation (less deep) and another physics metaphor of the astronomical machine of precession (least deep).If anyone reading this knows more, or can direct us as to where to find more decoding, please add a comment to this review (there's a bit in Farrell's book ""The Grid of the Gods"").Farrell's ""Cosmic War"" traces a cluster of names from ancient Mesopotamia and Egypt that are the same entity as (or very closely related to) Hermes-Thoth including: (An)Zu, Ninurta/Nimrod/Ninus/Enmer/Emerkar, Marduk/Merodach, Nergal, Baal/Osiris/Tammuz/Adonis/Dionysus/Bacchus, Enki/Ea/Eyah/Yahweh/Lucifer/Ra/Sungod/Lightbearer and even the Mason's Hiram Abiff. [Later note: Farrell's ""Thrice Great Hermetica"" provides even more insight into Hermetica.]I would like to suggest, instead of Hermes, two of the greatest hermetic teachers in history: Thomas H Burgoyne's ""The Light of Egypt: v. 1: The Science of the Soul and the Stars"" - a great classic work of mystical enlightenment and Russell Walter's ""A New Concept of the Universe"". For those interested in truths, I also suggest Tsarion, a deep thinker of our time about ancient secrets, who shows (for example)how the Emerald Tablets actually refer to the tarot. Not in the variations the tarot is known of today, but its original form, involving a mixture of kabala, tarot, numerology and astrology, which he explains are sister disciplines. You can learn more about this (free) from Tsarion himself - there are hours and hours of Tsarion on youtube, mostly fascinating.For much much more on the secrets of ""pre""history than 99.99 per cent of us can possibly glean from this book, see Lana Cantrell's ""Greatest Story Never Told"" which is available free on the internet - verbose but amazing in parts. Also see Shannon Dorey's 3 books on the Nummo.As for Jordan Maxwell's ""The Brotherhood of the Illes"" - another blow-your-mind book available free on the internet... and Santos Bonacci (starting with As Above so Below' (especially part 2) and with 'Sovereignty-Roman Law'... well you need to experience them for yourself.

RCSUZL5OPHHP0,"After reading ""Glory Road"" it's a joke that anyone would defend Heinlein's as writing strong female characters and not being sexists at all.  Aside from the ridiculous plot the characters are barely more than stereotypes. ""Scar"" is the strong hero and only the strong hero, never expect anything more.  Rufo is the unhappy third wheel.  Star, oh where to begin with her.  Nothing like having a female character that's body is the main description and focus of the character.  Maybe it's when Star gets upset that after their clothes are destroyed she can't try on her 'naughty' clothes for Scar.  Maybe it's when she talks back to Scar and he threatens to spank her with her own sword; something she repeats in a childlike way.After reading this book I couldn't believe how many people rush to explain taht Heinlein wasn't sexists at all.  No, he was writing about a woman in charge and in power.  To be fair Star does end up in a strong occuption, but that hardly excuses the first 2/3 of the novel of her being naked, Scar going on and on about how he wants to have sex with her and how beautiful she is, and her pathetic role as sex object throughout their trip.

This concert was apparently the last one in DP for Ritchie Blackmore.  After listening to it, I understand why.  For those of you that have heard that Glenn Hughes was the reason Ritchie left the band, this is the evidence.  I have a hard time believing that between Blackmore, Paice, Lord, or Coverdale - none of them had the balls to take the mic away from Glenn Hughes - or at least tell him to shut the hell up.  His in between song banter is embarrassing - and offensive to listen to.  Why did they let him continue to make a fool of himself - why did they not tell Coverdale to do the song intros?  Hughes singing in the space truckin waste of time is embarrassing.  No wonder Ritchie left.  The songs on this cd have Ritchies guitar low in the mix - because he obviously does not care anymore.  He unfortunately screws up the intro to Mistreated - an awful out of tune note that is just way off.  Every song here has problems.  SOTW - please please please - just let coverdale sing it!  Why let Hughes screw it up???  Highway Star - Ritchie must have lost a string or 2 - he is so way off in his solo - you can hear him trying to bend up to the right key - then they just mix him down - it is a complete mess.  The end of the song completely falls apart.  Space Truckin - there is 10 min of complete waste of time.  Hughes doing his falsetto R&B wannabe stuff - THAT is the reason Ritchie left.

RPHMDV5KJFW5R,"I didn't find the chair comfortable or very functional.  The seat cushion was surprisingly firm - too much so for my taste - and sitting on it for an extended period of time even with breaks wasn't very comfortable.  I'm around 160 lbs for reference.  The lumbar adjustment is very limited and somewhat flimsy.  I think just the bottom portion is intended to provide the most support while the top just floats there not doing much.  It only adjusts a couple of inches up and down and fell just shy of where I wanted it.  The armrest material is a little hard and didn't extend up as far as I expected.  If you are fairly tall I imagine you might want these a bit higher (I'm 5 ""9 and had them maxed out in height).  The head rest is not adjustable other than being removable (this is no surprise as it's not an advertised feature) but unless you have the perfect upper body height or only want to use it when leaning far back it's basically useless.  I also found that the chair sat a bit high for my liking.  I had it completely bottomed out and would have liked the ability to lower it by another inch or two so I could not only sit lower but have that little bit of give you get from the pneumatic cylinder when sitting down.  Generally your thighs should be parallel to the ground when seated and I couldn't accomplish this.  The mesh back was something I'm not at all used to so while it wasn't all that comfortable for me I can't say there was anything really wrong with it - I'm just used to cushioned backs.Assembly was another problem.  The chair isn't overly complicated as there are only a few parts, however there are a series of bolts and washers of varying sizes. The instructions are barely suitable to be called instructions.  They consist a parts list which in my case didn't list all of the parts that came in the box.  Above that are a small handful of few pictures on how to assemble it where you need to match up part numbers to the part pictures below then find that piece - but zero instruction outside of that.  You can do this by yourself which I did but it would be much much easier with some help.  The way the pictures demonstrate assembly don't seem consider gravity.  Since you are most likely stuck on Earth you're better off with a helper or assembling it in a different order (i.e. ground up maybe).  My kit came with a bunch of lock washers which weren't indicated in the assembly instructions anywhere but I assumed needed to be used.  The real deal breaker with assembling this chair was that I only received two of the four bolts needed to secure the seat to the base assembly properly.  I was able to work around this but shouldn't be expected to do so.  In the end I properly assembled the chair in 20-30 minutes but was left wondering why the assembly instructions were so lacking.  Maybe they are pushing people to pony up the extra money for 'professional assembly'.Overall I wasn't that impressed with the chair and will be returning it.  I took a gamble and it didn't pay off.  I was looking for an ergonomic chair and thought I could shortcut a few hundred dollars - these chairs can be supremely expensive.  Next time I'll make sure there are reviews that span a few months if possible so I can at least gauge how the chair holds up and get a better overall feel for it.  At the time of my purchase there were only 15 reviews that spanned less than a month and all but a couple of those reviews seemed suspiciously positive.",1,1,0,1
R2JC7D6MYL202H,"I love the grill - this review however, is for the assembly that was “included.” I ordered the grill as a gift and specifically purchased it through Amazon because it INCLUDED free assembly. I waited for delivery instead of picking it up at the local box store because assembly was included.I scheduled the assembly and provided my first three choices for a scheduled time.  Then the assembler cancelled on me only 30 minutes prior to the agreed upon and mutually scheduled time. No back up, no alternate, just “sorry about your luck.”Putting together a grill for three hours on a family weekend was not what I had in mind when I purchased this from Amazon. I would have bought it from Home Depot on Wednesday and assembled it myself during the week, had I known how unreliable the assembler would be. Thanks for nothing, Amazon.",0,0,0,0

I really loved the idea though and I wanted it to work so i kept it for a few days and tried to use it but that just made it worse.

R3DPT9CV4LDQVL,"I was surprised to see so many positive reviews for this movie.  From a description of the plot line, it would seem like this movie would be full of fantastic creatures and an adventurous story.  Instead, the story is painfully one dimensional and loaded with inconsistencies and fallacies.  I will not give a plot summary here as others have done that better than I could.Thumbs Up* Makeup and costumes were excellent.* I read another review that criticized the special effects, but I thought they were great.* The stylization is consistent and creates an interesting mood.Thumbs Down* A story loaded with holes and inconsistencies* I wasn't attached to the characters.  I thought the little girl was irritating and Brendan Frazer's actions were so erratic and nonsensical that he never truly caught my interest.  Their story never really drew me in as an audience member.Inconsistencies* Brendan Frazer's character claimed he never read the girl any stories, yet she knows quite a few characters from literature.* Why does the girl have a British accent?  She's been raised by an American father.* In the middle of the movie, the characters decide to go to the author's house to see if he has an additional copy.... really?... they didn't think of this in the 9 years they've been searching??* Brendan Frazer's distrust of dustfingers in the beginning of the movie doesn't make any sense.  There is no disincentive to teaming up.* The characters realize that whatever the people with the ""gift"" read comes to life so they decide to read things that they want to happen.  I have a hard time believing they wouldn't have come to that conclusion a little earlier.* Lighting the castle on fire in the end was completely unnecessary* They make it a point to drive to the Great Aunt's house.  In fact, the Brendan Frazer character said ""we NEED to get there"".  Yet there was absolutely no purpose in them going there.  Great Aunt was really no help and there was absolutely no need to go there.I don't believe this movie will necessarily motivate/not-motivate children to read.  Even if the net effect of this movie were positive, there are other ""pro reading"" movies that do the same thing significantly better.",0,0,1,1

As for the printer itself, it's a great printer, copier and scanner. It's quick, and the quality is good.UPDATE: I can't recommend this printer. There's no easy way to print envelopes.

But even though it was less than half the price of the HP cartridge, I decided to test this one before ordering a full set of color ones.The cartridge fit fine, and the printer seemed happy with it. (There was a dialog asking to validate it as a genuine HP cartridge, but obviously that wouldn't make sense.) For the first few prints, it seemed OK. But after 10 page or so, a series of smudges appeared down the left side of every page. I tried removing, gently shaking, and replacing the cartridge a number of times, to no avail. I tried the cleaning page (although the printer cleaning process never touched the black, cyan, or magenta cartridges, which I verified with HP, who still hasn't gotten back to me about why the cleaning process doesn't match the manual and online instructions), and closely examining the cartridge for problems.In the end, I was forced to order a new HP cartridge. Using that eliminated the smudges.I don't like paying exorbitant prices for the HP cartridges, but if this is an example of the quality of the compatible cartridges, then there really isn't a choice.

RO9I87DNX3FXE,"Alright, let's just cut to the chase.  PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: ON STRANGER TIDES is a huge disappointment.  It will make lots of money and spawn more sequels...but the spark has gone out, and frankly, I'm not sure anything will help.  As long as Capt. Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) is the major character, these films just aren't going to cut it.Think back on the first film in the series POTC: THE CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL (goodness, typing all these long titles is tedious).  It starred two lovely up-and-coming performers at the height of their popularity (Keira Knightley and especially Legolas...oh, I mean Orlando Bloom).  And Johnny Depp was there too...a popular, slightly hip actor.  And the film featured state of the art effects, some juicy supporting performances (especially from always reliable Geoffrey Rush) and was a burst of fresh air.  A lush pirate adventure that was actually fun!  Knightley and Bloom were lovely to look at and feisty and witty.  And Depp was a revelation.  His Sparrow was a unique and amazing creation.  (I won't run down all his now very familiar characteristics.)  So much so that Depp was nominated for an Oscar and went from modestly successful leading man to full blown STAR.  The world was drowned in Depp and we embraced his oddball characterizations.  He went on to receive another Oscar nomination for FINDING NEVERLAND and to considerable oddball success in more and more Tim Burton films.Meanwhile, POTC: DEAD MAN'S CHEST arrived.  Packed even more full of effects, it still had lots of fun...but suffered from sequel-bloat.  More was not always more.  But I still found it quite enjoyable, with some stunt work that was fun (the big ""hamster ball"" scene is still clever).  Depp was now solidly the star, but Sparrow was still new enough that we wanted more.  But by the time POTC: AT WORLD'S END came along, the film was SO special effects laden, SO loud and SO Jack Sparrow centric that I felt the series was pretty much played out.  The movie was long and frequently boring.  Big CGI battle scenes were not enough to engage.  The characters were so familiar.  There was nothing new that Jack Sparrow could bring to the table.  His strange accent, odd mincing and fake-drunk demeanor were totally familiar.  But of course, we viewers attended dutifully and saw the series wrapped up.  The Knightley / Bloom characters had their arc more or less wrapped up (and by now, Bloom was not even remotely a movie star any more).  It was a disappointing end to a series that started so well...but it really did seem to be the end.Now a new director and a producer Jerry Bruckheimer and star Depp have ""rebooted"" the series.  And in some ways, they have listened to the criticisms of the past.  The special effects, while still impressive, are significantly dialed down.  There has been an effort to return to character and not just noise for the sake of it.  And aside from Depp & Rush, they've pretty much abandoned all the previous characters.  But Sparrow is still very much the focus, and with stripping away most other distractions, it was painfully clear to me that Sparrow has nothing left to offer us.  There is NO surprise left in this character.  Depp tries hard...but he's not really acting any more, he's recreating mannerisms that once grew organically from Depp the actor.  He's become Depp the Jack Sparrow impersonator.  He can put on the makeup and costume...but not really anything more than a characterization.  Sparrow is a cartoon now.The movie still features some clever ""chase"" scenes, including an early scene involving horses and carriages that feels like something Jackie Chan might have staged.  But there's lots of talking in the first half of the film.  Lots of exposition.  Something to do with finding the fountain of youth, and who has stolen whose ship and why is the pirate Barbossa now the captain of an English military vessel.  And who is this woman (Penelope Cruise) with a complicated past history with Depp?  They were clearly lovers once, but are now bitter rivals.  But that romantic spark remains.  (Yet Cruz and Depp have no chemistry.  Really, when was the last time Johnny Depp had any real romantic chemistry with an actress?)  And then it turns out she's working with the evil pirate Blackbeard (Ian McShane)...the most evil pirate ever.  I found the first hour of this two hour fifteen minute film to be mostly quite tedious, and my eyelids frequently drooped.)Things perked up a bit when Blackbeard and his crew reach the mysterious island where mermaids live.  These mermaids are gorgeous sirens who lure men to them and then turn into some fairly vicious, fanged creatures.  The scene when Blackbeard is trying to trap one of these creatures is actually pretty impressive, and my interest in the film finally rose above lukewarm.  But that interest waned fairly soon.  And when Depp and Rush teamed up towards the end, I realized that the same ""been there, seen that"" feeling I had about Sparrow also applied to Rush's Barbossa.  Rush brings his best efforts, but the character is what it is...and so he's grown tiresome too.As always, the films are technically impeccable.  (I'd advise saving your money and passing on the 3D version.  That's what I saw, and the 3D added nothing to the film except unneeded darkness.)  But with a needlessly complicated plot, awkward exposition and a lead character who has evolved from surprisingly delightful to dishearteningly mundane...the PIRATES series has worn out its welcome.",0,0,0,0

Mine lasted just short of three weeks before the inner barrel shattered, leaving the pencil useless. The pencil, therefore,did not last nearly as long as one of the $ 0.99 Bic's that I can by by the Gross at Office Depot, and still come out money ahead. The plastic part which failed is very flimsy and it is no surprise to me that it failed. Why take the time and effort to design such an ergonomic and rugged exterior only to skimp so much on the interior pieces?I suppose that I will now get to see how well Rotring's warranty service works....",0,0,0,0

I was in a time crunch to get these out, and didn't have time to find or order a new set, so I went with them, however because of the hue I could only use two of the six designs (anchor - being all blue, and the rope as it was harder to tell the white was tinted).

RBNGWJXZ23I03,"If it were merely a precautionary tale about a society lulled into totalitarian rule, I could recommend this movie as a well made, fun bit of eye candy.  There are certainly a lot of elements here to like. Specifically, the story telling is extremely effective, and the visual effects are stunning.  Despite all this, ""V For Vendetta"" is wrecked by it's absolutley relentless ranting against nationalism, conservatism, and to a lesser extent Christianity.  In particular it is a soup-to-nuts diatribe against the United States war on terror, and is intended to inform us that supposed Islamic acts of terror were actually manufactured by conservatives in order to enslave the nation and exterminate homosexuals and artists.I won't bother to enumerate the twisted parallels between the movie plot and the war on Islamic terrorism.  I'm sure they have been identified and argued to death already.  I would like to point out however, that as of the date I am writing this review, the world is now safe from George W. Bush, who has quietly ridden off into the sunset, just like all previous U.S. presidents.A side note: The 1934 movie adaptation of the Alexandre Dumas novel ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" is referenced multiple times through out ""V For Vendetta"".  The 2002 movie adaptation is excellent and highly recommended.Let me leave you with a question to ponder.

R169DRRQN58JAJ,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***  'Crazy, Stupid, Love' is billed as a romantic comedy but ends up much more as a sentimental romance. The inciting incident comes up quite quickly: Wife Emily Weaver (Julianne Moore) announces she wants out of her 25 year marriage to husband Cal (Steve Carrell), after revealing that she's been having an affair with a colleague at work. It's a poorly written scene as Cal meekly acquiesces to Emily's demand and we never really find out why she's so dissatisfied in the first place.  After some rather long-winded scenes where Cal drowns his sorrows in drink at a local bar, bemoaning his fate as a marriage castaway, he finally meets Jacob Palmer (Ryan Gosling) and we break into the second act of the story. Jacob is a womanizer, a 'player' of great skill, if you will, who takes pity on Cal and decides to teach him how to pick up women. This is perhaps the best and most amusing part of the movie where Jacob first picks out a new wardrobe for Cal and then orders him to watch him in action, as he seduces women step-by-step. At first Cal is resistant but soon learns how to imitate Jacob's every line and he ends up bedding nine women, one of whom happens to be Kate, the public school teacher of Cal's son Robbie, played by Marisa Tomei. Unfortunately, Kate is one of Tomei's least likable roles in awhile, as she is an over the top nymphomaniac, who ends up continually giving Cal the finger later in the story, for bedding her and then leaving her high and dry.  Meanwhile, other ditsy complications accrue. Robbie becomes obsessed with he and his sister's babysitter, Jessica, who in turn develops a crush on Cal. There's a rather unfunny bit where Jessica, upon the advice of a seductive high school student rival, takes nude pictures of herself with the plan of sending them to Cal, only to have them fall, way too easily, into the hands of her hot head father. Even worse is the obnoxious infatuation that festers in Robbie throughout the film. How much can an audience take of a 13 year old's creepy obsession that only abates at just about the final scene of the movie?  'Crazy, Stupid, Love' becomes a lot less 'crazy' in the second half, more stupid and pours on the 'love', a little too thick. It seems that the cool Jacob character turns into a cream puff when he falls for Hannah, who happens to be the adult daughter of Emily and Cal. There are virtually no clues (except for Cal's reference early in the narrative, to 'Nana', Hannah's childhood appellation), so the big 'twist' feels forced and unearned, on the part of the film's scenarists. Now the tables are turned and Jacob is turning to Cal for 'advice' on how to handle relationships. Cal's insecurity and goofiness is a now a badge of honor, as he can show Jacob how to 'be himself'.  While Cal wants to cut off all ties with Jacob, now that he's fallen for his daughter, it doesn't take long before an extra dose of 'love', becomes the more prominent moniker in 'Crazy, Stupid, Love'. Yes, Cal soon sees the light and is willing to embrace ex-bad boy Jacob, as his new, potential son-in-law. He interrupts Robbie's speech as Salutatorian of the school, who is in the middle of a put down about true love, due to his rejection by Jessica. Cal recounts his courtship of Emily, affirming his love for her. After the graduation ceremony, Cal hands Robbie the nude photos of Jessica, as his 'consolation prize'. Robbie agrees to call off his stalking of Jessica, by shaking her hand and promising to look her up only once he finally begins to look more like his Dad in a few years. As if we couldn't predict it, Cal and Emily are seen reminiscing about the events of the past year and the implication is of course, that they soon will be back together.  Even more disappointing than the transformation of bad boy Jacob into into a virtual milquetoast, Julianne Moore is saddled with the weakest role in the film. We learn little about Emily throughout the film--and the pseudo-romantic subplot involving the dull office colleague, David Lindhagen (Kevin Bacon), proves to be a subplot that goes nowhere.  'Crazy, Stupid, Love' is occasionally amusing, especially when Carrell and Gosling face off in the first half. But by the denouement, we're back in the realm of the predictable, and even worse: an egregious, sentimental, happy-ending. Try this once but see it a second time at your own peril!",0,0,0,0

There is a fine line between a funny spoof and plain silliness. Brooks' method typically lands the scenes in the second category. There were very few occasions where the goings on made me crack a smile, and a lot more where I just groaned. The busload of famous stars making an appearance did not manage to save the show.

R3DIIZ4TZJ3E06,"This is so bad that I need to write a review so people stop wasting money on this and go for one of the other stands (I have 3 different stands from Amazon). I had two foldable book holders from the Harvard bookstore years ago which were amazing, even for heavy, overpriced physics books with atrociously short shelf lives (I've since found the stands on Amazon- ""Mighty Bright fold-n-stow""). Sadly, they got lost at some point. I bought this Fellowes stand as an add-on from Amazon. BEWARE! This thing simply isn't designed to hold heavy, or even normal books- the foldable prongs are just too close together for this stand to bear any significant weight. I ended up shelling out the money and bought one $10 Mighty Bright, as well as an $15 Actto book holder from Amazon. The Actto takes up a little more space in my bag, but it really is worth it, even better than the Mighty Bright. Well built and as I write this review it's propping open a hefty, 900 page, hardback, 9 x 12 science textbook. I read elsewhere that the Fellowes stand has been around for some 35 years... to my knowledge, books were just as thick/heavy back then, so I don't know how it managed to sell before the age of the tablet (which is all this stand is good for).

RAMCNTS4AUB09,"I wish that I could have given ""Glory Road"" a better rating but to tell you the truth, I thought that it was terrible. I felt that the whole book in general had no purpose and it did not entertain on any level. The story is a bout Vietnam veteran Oscar who meets a gorgeous woman on a French island. He finds an ad in the paper and goes in to see if he can get the job that is being offered. It ends up that the woman that he met put out the ad and she wants him. He is hired as a hero to go on an adventure to find the Egg of the Phoenix. Sure, the plot sounds promising, but put simply, it's not. This book has many flaws. You have no clue about the adventure and why Oscar is being dragged to other planets until you are around halfway through the novel. Sure, you want to know what everything's about, but Robert Heinlein just lest everything drag on for way too long and you will become very bored with the book. Less than 100 pages into the book I wanted to stop right there but I kept going thinking that it would get much better. It didn't. As the book moved on, the plot got even more pointless and it got to a point where you wonder why you are reading this piece of drivel. The characters are one-sided and you won't even care about them. The characters are boring and not even worth reading about. The quest that Oscar, Star, and Rufo (you'll learn about him after the quest is done) seems so pointless. All the characters do is fight monsters and dragons and get in trouble with a lord. This could have been a lot of fun but Heinlein just was not writing as to keep you interested. You do not even find out what the whole plot is about until you are over 100 pages into the book and then after the quest you find out about the signifigance of the egg. I guess that I am going to have to read more Heinlein to really enjoy his works. ""Glory Road"" does have it's rare, good moments and that's why I gave the book 2 stars. This novel is flawed and has no depth, making for a painful and boring read. I really do not recommend this book to any reader; there's a lot better stuff out there.Happy Reading!",0,0,0,0
R72KYHYBJII9K,"Where are the morals anymore?  The shallow makers of this movie put nudity wherever possible.  Do they not think they can make a good movie without nudity?  What is wrong with people today pushing the envelope as much as possible?It is really too bad that they put all of that crap in the movie because it will never be in our collection.  Which brings me to my point about this movie.  If the movie had no nudity in it and was graded purely on the storyline and action content, cinematography, acting ability (so forth) then it would have received a five star from me.  The action sequences were visceral and powerful and had that kind of energy you get from an amazing kill from a first person shooter.  But all of that has been overshadowed by something horrible.  This film is what happens when you get a bunch of guys together with no class and no honor and let them have free reign to display their perverted minds on the big screen.  Shame on them!

RCF8WM10PHGZF,"I bought this DVD based on the strength of the good reviews here on Amazon...wow was I led astray by the Amazon community!I recently got into the Bar Method and bought one of their DVDs. I wanted to mix it up so I looked on Amazon for some other barre/isometric/Lotte Berk inspired workouts.Firstly, I hate that the DVD is voiced over instead of the instructors speaking as they work. This perhaps explains why the DVD is SO POORLY CUED. Without counts (i.e., let's do 2 sets of 10, 3 more to go, etc.) it's so hard to tell when an exercise starts and stops. Also, you'll often see an instructor stop the exercise, and then you hear the cue to end. As other reviewers have mentioned, it's also extremely repetitive (""ears over shoulders, shoulders over hips"")--I get that posture is an important part of an effective workout, but I don't need to hear it fifty times. There's also other time-wasting instruction (""breathe, enjoy the stillness, etc."") I'm just trying to get a good workout, not go to therapy!To me, one test of a great workout DVD is whether I can follow along without having to stare at the TV the whole time--the cueing should be descriptive enough that you can turn away from the TV (i.e., to check your form in the mirror, which is really key in a workout like this.) I couldn't do that with this DVD. Again, this is just due to terrible voiceover and cueing. More actual instruction would be helpful--less focus on ""enjoying the stillness."" And during the ab segment, how are you supposed to put your feet on the wall and watch the TV at the same time? I kept having to twist my neck around to see the TV, and thus didn't feel like I was able to do the exercises correctly. I basically just ended up doing my own ab workout, because it was impossible to watch and perform the exercises at the same time.The DVD is also listed as 5 10-minute workouts. Well, for the first four, 2 minutes of each segment is eaten up by stretches, and the final segment is only stretching. This means there is only about 32 minutes of work on the DVD. That's not enough for me to feel like I got a real workout in.The one redeeming factor of this DVD was the glute segment. I really felt the burn there. However, even for the 10 minutes of the thigh work, I barely felt the burn...and I feel like the burn within 2 minutes of thigh work using Bar Method's DVDs.This DVD is going to eBay!",0,0,0,0

What a rip-off. Total rip-off. Do not buy this, under any circumstances. Ink cartridges for this pen cost me $8 apiece. On April 27th I installed a new ink cartridge in this pen. This cartridge cost me $8. Since that date, I signed exactly 30 computer-printed checks and endorsed 10 of them since they were payable to me. I was unable to sign my 31st check since this $8 ink cartridge was dry. As for me, I will go back to using one of my traditional ink pens. Once all of my remaining horribly expensive ink cartridges are gone, I will throw my $190 Parker pen into the garbage and charge this up to having endured a terrible experience. Sadly, this might well not happened for several months since I have nine of these ink cartridges on hand which I bought for a total of $72 not including those other cartridges which went dry. Incidentally, I have seen those infamous ink cartridges offered for sale at Amazon.com for as much as $10 each. If Amazon.com had allowed me to award this pen a total of zero stars, that's exactly what it is worth. I should mention that my signature contains seven letters and my endorsement (including all letters and my first name) contains 11 characters. Seems to me that eight dollars is a mighty high price to pay for putting 330 cursive letters on a computer-generated expense check.",0,0,0,0

R137DRL3BKYS8V,"The theme and the description sounded so enticing that I couldn't wait to get this book, but I was sorely disappointed. The first paragraph should've clued me in that this was a pointless piece of endless (and quite pretentious) drivel, but I was curious enough to keep on reading. For a while, that is. It just didn't seem to *go* anywhere, or have any point, and to be honest, it wasn't like I was enjoying the prose either. A few beautiful expressions and ideas here and there, but otherwise quite awful.To give you an idea of what you'll be in for if you purchase this and make a valiant attempt at actually reading it, here's a paragraph from the prologue:""His mind flickered with the infinite landscapes he had seen: a mosaic of presidential skull blowing in red fragments over Dealey Plaza, a babushka lady in the Dallas sunlight through a telescopic sight and cine camera on a mound of grass, bodies smashed in Pisa like a horror movie in the slabs of a de Cherico painting, fetuses in Roswell and the stench of Artesia's rotting cattle, flaming tanks in the tar pits of Los Angeles, barricades of dead horses and a cinnamon-haired general pushing his trembling revolver against his breast, the British Telecom Tower shearing in two like a broken horn, sex parties in Babel like a pyre of engorged flesh, the libraries of Babylon machine-gunned, Grumman Wildcats pouring like locusts into the Bermuda Triangle, bleach evaporating in the clinical halls of Glenside Hospital, women electrocuted in colleges of poetry, soft riots at rock concerts, Parisian hashish dens beneath the falling gargoyles of Notre Dame, tumescent rain forests with hanging monkeys, the star-worn care of nights on the flat rooftops of Nazareth.""Amusingly, other authors quoted on the back cover refer to ""occasional orgasms [of] mellifluous prose"" and the experience of finding oneself ""often provoked, occasionally disgusted or even enraged, and always riveted."" I mostly found myself bored and annoyed. Perhaps I'm missing some grand point or mystical experience by being too stupid or not having read it all the way through, but even so, I just don't think it's worth it if you have to trudge through endless paragraphs like the one quoted above.

RHWO7FMOQP1ZN,"The first third of this book is so engaging and interesting that I was ready to recommend it enthusiastically.  Unfortunately, the plot just doesn't make any progress from there.  Even the lightest of airplane or beach reads has to deliver some payoff to the reader.  The last two-thirds of Six Years is not only not fun to read, but but it is just plain irritating.  Sure, you get some of the same witty banter and observations that make the Myron Bolitar series (of which I am a big fan) so popular.  The plot, however, is so full of holes that you wish the protagonist would just hurry up and get himself killed, as he appears to be dead set on doing.Jake, the hero of this book, is, to put it politely, a dimwit.  If you enjoy reading a ""mystery"" in which the stumbling protagonist is always five or six steps behind the reader, this book is for you.  It takes Jake the entire length of this book to gather information the basic outlines of which you, the intelligent reader, has figured out in the first third of the novel.  When he finally fills in the details, they don't add significantly to this basic outline.  Along the way, there are many preposterous twists and turn that just don't stand up to scrutiny.  Sometimes the bad guys are geniuses who turn up out of nowhere.  Sometimes they fail to look for Jake in the most obvious places, giving him time to investigate without any pressure.  In particular, the book's ending depends on a mysterious appearance that the author never even tries to explain.Basically, Jake keeps stumbling into the same boring kind of situation over and over, without ever putting two and two together.  Likewise, his constant rhapsodizing over his lost love is so sappy and repetitious that it makes you think that Coben was trying to write a Harlequin romance without any real clue about how to do so.Based on the number of five-star reviews, it is clear that many readers found this book thrilling and engrossing.  I can only conclude that these readers are either as slow-witted as Jake, or they have a great deal of patience for books in which nothing much happens, and that which does happen doesn't make much sense.",0,0,1,1
REJ29GT2AIVYN,"What a disappointing printer. This is my first ink-jet printer and I got attracted by the many features it offers but it has been such a let down, very quickly. Leaving aside the fact that it runs through ink at an extraordinarily high rate despite pretty light home printing use, the main issue is that the print head nozzles get clogged up very regularly and you need to run the cleaning routine just as regularly. The process consumes ink which is costly (check out the cost of replacement cartridges before you buy one, this will require a dedicated budget!) but, 2 months after I purchased it, the black ink nozzle has become chronically clogged which requires running the nozzle cleaning routine MULTIPLE times to get it fixed. I was looking for a simple home printing solution but this has become a constant headache. I simply would not recommend it.",0,0,0,0
R3JDE9AEW76KDN,"I have some problems with this book, and none of them have to do with the history. I mean, it is supposed to be an historical fiction, so I won't pick too much. But my problem is the writing of the book. I agree with another review I read here- the writing is very amature. The characters aren't believable, I have a hard time relating to them, as much as I want to like them. Also, any kind of mystery or conflict the plot could have had is lost as you muddle through all of the flashbacks.As a person who has a Ph.D. in history, I had a couple of other problems. No university is going to let an author teach a history class, unless you have a Ph.D. in history, I don't care how famous an author you are. Also, the thought of someone literally running around campus in a $500 pair of Manolos is laughable. For anyone who has worn any kind of high heels on a college campus, standing on them for hours while you teach, and then walking around is hard enough, there's no way anyone could do it in 4 1/2 inch heels.Also, there is a part where Jean-Claude is explaining to Maureen that having a Ph.D. in history is pointless because he ""knows"" a professor who studies Medieval French History, and she had never even been to France. This is the most ridiculous statement I have ever heard. I know several people who do Medieval France, and most of them spent at least a year in France doing research for their dissertations. I don't know a single European historian who can do their dissertations solely by using ""university databases"". Most of these documents can only be found in archives, although it is true that more of them are being digitalized- but we are years away from having ALL documents online. Perhaps Ms. McGowan should have actually looked into it before she made such blanket statements about Ph.D.s. Or perhaps she has an inferiority complex because she herself doesn't have a degree in history.So, to be brief (because I know I haven't been so far), they say that when you write you should only write what you know. I don't think has happened in this case. Perhaps she should stick to being a reporter.",0,0,0,0

R3G8NLSAHQXFL8,"**There are spoilers in this review**As a young professional woman, I cannot stand Janie. She is completely clueless; not a cute, quirky clueless. Rather, she is annoyingly thick, and she constantly complains about her life situation, which she repeatedly puts herself in. She is almost reminiscent of Dora the Explorer - a mountain is right next to her, yet she cannot see it. She is annoyed toward the beginning of the book because she feels that her friends don't think she can function in real life without someone else directing her. That is a completely reasonable thing to be mad about -- until you get to know her character. She gets drunk off of 1 drink, she cannot understand other peoples emotions or feelings, and she lets men run all over her. She has no ability (or willingness) to notice social cues or put 2+2 together. Of course the other characters worry about her, because she seems unable to function on her own as an adult woman.One of the biggest character flaws for me is the way she deals with her controlling ex-boyfriend, John. He is rich, and his father gets Janie her job. She someone loses her job the same day she breaks up with John.... and somehow it takes her half of the book to realize that she lost her job BECAUSE she only had the job due to John. Without John, why would she keep a job that John got her? Obviously being fired can be attributed to him. Even after the relationship ends, he is interested in making the relationship work, and Janie keeps in constant communication with him. He believes she may want to salvage the relationship, while she believes they can be friends. But John says that he loves her and wants to be with her every single time that they interact. He is clearly not interested in a ""friendship"" when he begs to provide for her and take her out. Can any woman in 2018 really be that thick-skulled? It is completely unbelievable that she is that blind to the world around her. It seems as though the author tried to make up for her severe stupidity by making Janie ""book-smart."" But in reality, she just has a plethora of incredibly random, irrelevant factoids that anyone who watches Jeopardy could accumulate. Her constant word vomit of uninteresting facts is annoying and it slows the story down significantly. I cannot believe that Quinn is actually interested in such conversations or facts, because I bought the damn book, and I can't even be bothered be listen to her. As a young working woman, I find it hard to stomach the whole ""I want to be independent"" assertions of Janie, while she only takes jobs from men who have flirted with her and she allows herself to be taken care of. She is not assertive or socially aware in the slightest. I cannot stand bimbo characters who cry wolf like Janie does. And I've wondered many times if Janie is actually a bimbo, or whether she has a personality disorder or whether she sits somewhere on the autism spectrum -- I just find it hard to believe that she simply ""doesn't get it.""Secondly -- the writing in this book is atrocious. There is a stupid amount of unnecessary adjectives, and they are never straightforward or appropriate. Don't get me wrong, I love reading a book that inspires to me expand my vocabulary. But this book is written similarly to how I wrote papers as a freshman in undergraduate school - I would write with a thesaurus next to me and replace any simple words with overly complicated language in an effort to make myself seem smart. For example, Janie (barely) drinks some alcohol, and the sensation she feels is described as a ""cozy comfortableness."" Why would you not just say that she felt ""cozy and comfortable"" rather than using an atrocious form of an adjective like that? That is one of many examples of poor word form and poor word choice. Additionally, words like ""unseeingly"" were used 30 times in one exchange (an exaggeration... well, is it even??). She also uses words like ""mournfully"" and others that are just, plain and simply, poor writing. I felt myself getting annoyed by the constant compound adjectives that were just unnecessary and sloppy. At one point Janie describes Quinn with about 4 compound adjectives in one sentence.Overall, I am upset I spent my credit on the book. I love romantic fiction books where the twists and turns in the story are not completely foreseeable. Additionally, I prefer characters that are believable and relatable. This book was about two overly protective millionaires who both wanted to be with a completely clueless, irritating dependent woman. The character development was piss poor. The flow of the story was painfully slow. The writing was weak. And overall, the book was not enjoyable. Please save your money and try a funny, well-written romance book like The Hating Game: A Novel, Good Girl, The Wedding Date, or The Naked Truth.I would give one star but that seemed extreme and the woman who voiced the audio book did a fantastic job.",0,0,0,0

R1UMNL2HPJLRO7,"""V for Vendetta"" is one of the most boring revolutionary epics I've ever watched.  With a screenplay and production by the Wachowski Brothers, I'd at least expect plenty of explosions and some neat special effects because, let's be honest, folks, the only reason that the first ""Matrix"" flick did very well was because of the whole slo-mo bullet biz.  After the initial shock, the sequels of that particular flick were nothing more than fluff.  However, it seems that the Wachowski boys were hoping that adapting a graphic novel (i.e. a really big comic book for adults too ashamed to admit they still read comics) with a Shakespeare-spouting, Fawkes mask-wearing, anti-hero/terrorist wannabe would make for a cool picture.  It almost did, but the fact is that Hugo Weaving's portrayal of ""V"" is so weighed down by theatrics that the viewer is more likened to take a nap than take up arms.  Natalie Portman delivers her standard wooden performance that won our hearts in the Star Wars prequels.  Why didn't they just go with an actual British woman to play her role?  Portman's only great performance was in ""The Professional"" with Jean Reno, and that was quite a few years ago.The story centers around a supposed terrorist who goes by the name ""V.""  He's mad at the government for making him into a hideous monster and has decided to overthrow said government by blowing up numerous British monuments and historically important buildings.  The only catch is that this ""terrorist"" politely allows all of the citizens inside the buildings to escape before he does his damage.  Doesn't quite sound like a terrorist to me.  Sounds more like a pest.The government head, gamely played by John Hurt, is supposedly meant to represent the current U.S. government.  However, the only thing that ran through my mind when we see Hurt's character screaming and ranting at his top officers was the same screaming and ranting done by Hilary Clinton, John Kerry, and perennial loser, Al Gore.  Hurt screams threats at everyone hoping to force them into submission.  He wants things his way and doesn't care what anyone else thinks.  He's a big baby, a dictator, just like many of today's liberal leaders attempt to be under the guise of ""tolerance.""  I hate to get political with this review, but a movie such as this begs to moved into that arena.The special effects are done fairly well, and the Wachowskis even pull the old bullet-time effect out of their dwindling bag of tricks except this time they use V's knives instead of bullets.I'll agree with other reviewers that this film does make you think.  A totalitarian government is an evil thing, but some sort of order is needed.  Without it, you have anarchy, and anarchy has never worked.  Why?  Because someone ultimately wants to be the leader.  To be a revolutionary with a clear idea of how things should be and the best way to engage those ideals is one thing, but to simply be a rebel without a reason is absurd.  This is a film about revenge, not revolution.If you loved the ""Matrix"" trilogy, you'll probably be disappointed by this flick.  The action is spread throughout a bogged down monologue by V and the end result attempts to be artistic, but falters in the end.Recommended as a rental only.",0,0,0,0

R44L3AHID5Z2W,"First off, I would give this book zero stars if possible. But, as I can only give it one, I guess I'll tell you why.First off, the plot line is ripped out from a number of books, with similarities to Dragon Riders of Pern, Lord of the Rings, and a number more.Second, his discribing skills are... Lacking. All of his chapters (Except for the first three, he redid those ones) had set ups similar to this: Setting discription, action in setting, put characters into the setting then to add in more action.Third, the urgals, are amazing like J. R. Tolkien's little demon things. You see, the reason why he tacked on horns and a few other things was to evade the fact that he would be sued if he didn't.Forth, the Elves languages are nearly exactly the same to the Lord of the Rings once again, while where the elfs came from is exactly the same (they came on silver ships from the east.), and then the same with the dwarfs.Fifth, the book's discription is terrible. There was something in there that was pretty much like this: The urgal ran towards Eragon, then froze in time so the author could explain how it looked. (Note, the last part was in the book, but it's how the urgal acted pretty much.)Sixth, the plot is predictable. Every 'twist' there is not a surprise, but another dismal fact that it's so much like other books that if you didn't read this book, you'ld still knew what was going on.Seventh, he literally stripped some names from Lord of the Rings and altered them slightly and/or he added these: ' and kept all the lettering order in the same order.Other reasons, (Spoiler alert.) my sister and I were reading the books for this triligy, and I told my sister that Eragon had a brother. Instantly, my sister knew who it was and then cursed that the author, and I have a feeling that the ending will be like this: ZOMG! Eragon won! *gasp* It was so hard! But everyone knew he could! Ta-da! He didn't have to kill his brother! He still has a crush on a princess elf! But she won't love him back! ZOMG!I think that this book go  waaaay to much credit for being 'original' or 'creative'. To say it bluntly, it's not. It's pathetic and sad.-De.PS: Doesn't matter how big the book is, it depends on how well written and orignal it is.",0,0,0,0

R1K3DFOIBX2TRX,"Being a typical horse-loving 10 year old girl (way, way back in the day..), it almost goes without saying that of course I read Black Beauty by Anna Sewell. The story of the gentle black horse in Victorian England is simple and perfect. It's a true classic for kids, proven over several generations that have grown up reading it just as I did. With this in mind, I went looking to buy a copy at a bookstore yesterday as a birthday present for a 10 year old young lady.Now as far as I know, kids today are no less intelligent, and they do still teach them to read starting in Kindergarten. So imagine my horror at discovering that the attractively bound, hardback of Black Beauty that I picked up was, uh, *paraphrased*  (actually there are more accurate terms for it, but for the sake of the Amazon censors I'd better stick to the less graphic ones). Comparing selections of this version side by side with the original, the so-called ""Classic Starts"" Black Beauty plot is stripped down; worse, the lovely language of the original has been replaced with, ahem, simplified text and dialog that could have been written by the author of the Judy Moody books. This left little sense of the turn of the century England setting, and completely obliterated the spirit and style of Anna Sewell. Is this the publisher's idea of a quality introduction to children's lit?What I really want to know is, why change it at all?  As I said, kids today aren't less smart, they should be able to read the real Black Beauty well enough by the time they are in the 9-12 suggested age range. The reason it's a classic is because IT WORKED JUST AS IT WAS. Sorry, I had to put that in large type for the publishers, who evidently believe that the rest of the population matches their literary fluency.I hope other parents who are planning on purchasing this and other classics for their kids will catch the difference between the CS paraphrased/heavily edited/oh what the heck, dumbed down versions and the real books.  Apparently the School Library Journal agrees with me on this, if you care to read their review above the customer reviews on the product page.-Andrea, aka Merribelle",0,0,0,0

R1AAVGEJU8NN7V,"Very disappointing book. I've utilized Kelby's books before and been very impressed but this one is a complete disaster. i rated it a 2 only because there are a few decent points, and for someone who hasn't used Lightroom before Kelby spends a long time explaining Camera Raw which is nearly identical to Lightroom. In other words it might be mildly beneficial for someone who is a complete novice to all of the Adobe products.However its a disorganized mess and can't really be used as a reference. For most photographers adding Photoshop to the use of Lightroom, the reasons are to take advantage of the powerful tools such as Layers and Smart Objects. Kelby seems to just fit these in as he goes along rather than devoting the time necessary to truly master these.Really surprised but look elsewhere for better resources when learning the program",0,0,0,0

R2CB8O1CWB09H1,"In my humble opinion, this book does not deserve the glowing reviews it has received.On the whole, I don't regret reading it because it does contain some interesting information and even a few practically useful suggestions. But it's a bit fluffy, and I don't think it meaningfully improved my sales skills.My core issue with the book is simple: Daniel Pink is writing as an authority about how to sell, but he's not an accomplished salesman. From what I can gather, he's never actually worked in sales...He's obviously a brilliant guy with great credentials and an Ivy League pedigree. He's also got lots of research to reference. And that's all well and good if you want to hear about some interesting studies and philosophize about how everybody is a salesperson in today's world because we all need to use persuasion...But if you want to learn how to actually ""sell"" in the pure/traditional sense of the word -- I mean if you've got to get on the phone or meet with people you don't know and get them to buy a product or service from you -- then I suspect you'll get more out of reading books by people who have actually done that successfully.As I was reading this book -- especially when I got to the part where Pink dismissively talks about legendary car salesman Joe Girard -- I found myself thinking: ""I wonder how many cars Pink would sell this year if we put him in a car dealership and he had to just hack it out based on his current knowledge of sales."" I could be wrong, but I suspect Pink would do far, far worse than folks like Joe Girard, Zig Ziglar, Brian Tracy, etc.... folks who may have less impressive academic credentials but considerably more experience and success in selling.",0,0,1,1

R1SF68ZFODN1XS,"Buyer beware. The replacement lamp I got was 3rd party and not made by Benq as advertised. I bought this several months ago when my projector told me that the lamp will need to be replaced soon. When I received it I noticed that it wasn't in the same packaging as my first replacement lamp from BenQ and it looked slightly different. I have yet to put it in my projector as my current lamp is still going strong. Going back a looking at the reviews since my purchase I see lots of people stating that it has damaged their projectors which makes me very apprehensive to install this lamp.UPDATE:My old lamp finally gave out and I gave this one a shot. Thankfully it didn't immediately pop or damage the projector as others have reported. However the color is very muted and has very low brightness. To make things worse after about 10 minutes the color will mess up causing sections to go black and white and become distorted.The seller that fulfilled my order for the bulb by BenQ (which wasn't actually by BenQ) was P-Lamps. Unfortunately it seems Amazon clumps all of the same product together regardless if they're OEM or third party.

R31S7TM47C08C9,"TLDR: If you love SciFi, don't waste your time.Coming from an 80s SciFi fanatic, and an avid lover of the original book, this movie is terrible. If you appreciate movies such as Bladerunner, 2001, and Star Wars, I would advise you to stay very far away from this film. The pace, the scenes, and the acting is all subpar. Very important scenes were left out and or butchered if they did make the cut. The narration is confusing at times and there should have been a better storyboard. I understand, translation of a story from one media to another is difficult. But if you enjoyed the book, you will probably be disappointed.

R2B3T2ZKWG5A91,"This review is for the incandescent 2 D-cell version, however this is the 3rd Maglite I've owned so I feel well justified in my opinion of the Maglite brand being extremely overrated.Now my very first question is why with all of the benefits of LED is incandescent even still being sold??  Not only is this 27 lumen piece of junk so dim I can only see its benefit under extremely dark situations, but the 206 meters it claims to reach (that's around 675ft) is laughable, I wouldn't be surprised if the range isn't any more than 100' max, most of that 100 barely visible maybe only 20' where you can see clear.As if the most essential element to any flashlight didn't already receive a failing grade, I have to mention that every time I move too aggressively or drop the light even as little as a foot or 2, the bulb falls out and I spend several extra minutes a night opening up and reinserting the bulb.  There is (as with any maglight) a rotating head that adjusts the size of the light itself (big circle/little circle)  Of course the wider the viewing the dimmer the light, but not by so much that I can call this a fault.  However what IS a fault, and this is true on ALL maglites, is when you expand the area you get a huge dark 'O' in the center which is imo the most annoying thing ever.  This defeats the entire purpose and I find myself readjusting back to small more than I should ever need to.So that's bad, what else??  Well...did I mention when I first got the light the rubberized cover on the switch fell off on only my 2nd click.  I tried reinserting it, 4 clicks later it fell out again.  Fortunately I still have part of my old 3 cell (LED) that was missing its cover so I just put it aside to use in rebuilding that (if I ever do).  I'd love to recommend the 3 cell LED variety, it's longer and can be used as a defense tool (which is good for me since my job requires I walk around at night in bad areas of town).  The grip is great, flipping it up in the air gives the satisfaction that I'm sure many could compare similar to fidgit spinners.  I've dropped it multiple times from out of my work truck (approx 10' high) with no major damage, however the switch went out after maybe 6 months (same switch as the one on this light) and I've consistently had problems with fixing it to the point where a year later I found the easiest way to use my light was just remove the battery top and only reinstall and use my light when I absolutely needed it.  I would give the LED version a 3 outta 5 star average rating, but I would never ever ever recommend the incandescent version.  Maglite should be selling these $5 a piece and clearing their inventory.  I promised myself after the 3cell I'd never buy Maglite brand again, but unfortunately the entire reason I got this was to replace the 2cell I lost for a friend while my mechanic at work is working on fixing the switch on my old light.  Now I'll be buying yet another because I screwed up and got the wrong one, who woulda guessed? Maglite may not appreciate my review but I hope they at least appreciate my business. I hope everybody appreciates my honestly, I get no thrill out of giving any product a 1 star review.",0,0,0,0

At first, the camera recorded every single car that passed its eye, including helicopters (flight path for hospital helipad), even at night. However, it has only detected a human once since December 30th, and that was the mailman. It never records me entering or leaving the house. I lowered the sensitivity level to low and have changed the activity region from full view to a narrow view and something in between to no avail. Unfortunately, there isn't anywhere to place the camera where it cannot see the street and still record the front porch. As a result, I now know how much vehicle traffic there is up and down my street all night long. If anyone has any ideas on how to get it to record humans, I would appreciate it. I don't necessarily want to see the mailman or myself, but at least I would know it can recognize humans when needed.

R2X1OURX00TB1I,"Based on a long history with Palm (back to 1996 and the original Palm) and good reviews for the TX both here and on CNET, I purchased the TX.  Four times I tried to install the software, four times it failed.  The culprit is a little subroutine called VMDialogWrapper.exe.  I looked on Google, and found 3 references to this problem, and tried the solution mentioned there, a neat little program put out by Microsoft called Windows Installer Cleanup.  Even that did not help.  I know from previoius experience with Palm that they will not service what they sell, except with gobs of money, so I am reluctantly returning this unit.  It looks like a great design, has the WiFi and Bluetooth I wanted, etc.  Were it not for the lousy little subroutine, I would happily rate this either 4 or 5 stars, but if it's DOA, then the rating has to be lower.

It's a good ink with amazing color, but lacks the staying power I was looking for. In water, a good amount of it runs and washes away. Other reviews claim that this smearing behavior is a ""security feature"", but Noodler's Black doesn't smear at all after it dries. When exposed to bleach or peroxide, Kingfisher fades a great deal.

R1HHSBTF5C1H8,"Let me qualify the proceeding by saying this is the first (and will probably be the last) book of the ""In Death"" series I've read.  I assume there has been a good reason in the past for this series to be set in the future but there certainly isn't for this installment.  The future setting adds nothing at all to the story.  At the same token it doesn't really detract either so I'll just let it slide.  The story just isn't that interesting.  There are no remarkable revelations of evidence and for the most part, you know the basics of the why's/who's of the crime and your just waiting for the ""official"" data to come in.  I've read alot of police procedurals in my time and this is definately one of the least interesting plots I've come across.  I find the protagonist to be thoroughly unlikable.  Eve Dallas is completely butch.  Ms. Roberts has confused strength of character and toughness with masculinity.  So much so that female police officers are actually addressed as ""Sir.""  I don't think a paragraph goes by where Eve Dallas doesn't want to punch someone.  Many other writers have written female detectives as tough without stripping them completely of their femininity.  The dialogue is melodramatic and cliche - and not in a charming Raymond Chandler sort of way.  The author attempts to impart to the reader how great her characters are by having the other characters tell them how great they are.  It's a classic case of ""telling"" and not ""showing."" - a big characterization no-no. This is one of the few detective stories where my interest in finding out the details of the murders actually decreased as more evidence mounted.  This book is awful - I would suggest Michael Connelly (especially The Poet) instead.  I can't think of a single writer I wouldn't recommend over Roberts.  Very surprised at the reviews here at Amazon.",0,0,1,1
R1IJH17B15CDJV,"I'd initially raved about this pen and given it 5 stars. It looks great and writes smoothly. It also feels solid. It does have a substantial weight that I appreciate. But next time I'll wait to write a review.I was at first a little unhappy to discover that the interior has a thin plastic sleeve (the old American Cross pens that I've had were all metal inside), but this wasn't a huge deal. What initially ruined this pen for me is that after 2 weeks of regular use, the replaceable ink refill started clicking, as many cheap roller ball pens will do. I realized I probably had a faulty tip and that this problem may be as simple as putting in an ink refill. My concern was that if I did this and consistently got clicking from refills, I'd have a $75 pen that I can't return that is far too annoying to write with. The tip was clicking pretty much every time it touched paper and I don't write in cursive. I couldn't handle the sound, so I stopped writing with it.I was hoping to return the pen, but the seller was being very pushy about me accepting a replacement refill cartridge instead. This was annoying, but in the end I got tired of arguing and accepted the replacement cartridge. It was working well for several months.Then, after about one year, the clip lost all of its tension and just hangs there. This is why I'd wanted my money back in the first place: the overall quality of the pen is mediocre. That was obvious when the first tip was clicking all the time. Next time I decide I want my money back, I'll argue longer. This was a $75 pen; it should have been basically maintenance free for more than a year in my world.

R164ZMWAZ4QG9S,"Allow me a desperate cry when I say, ""When are we going to find a young writer who can actually WRITE??"" I had my hopes up for Paolini, but just like every single young writer I've read so far, it drizzles down to just crap. (Mad props go only to S.E. Hinton and Mary Shelley, who are the lone proof that young writers could do anything.)Age shouldn't even be a factor in judging this book, actually. I should be able to read this book without knowing a THING about the author, and be able to come out of it saying that it was a good book. Period. And this was NOT, not by a long shot. The storyline could not possibly be more cliche. I am so tired of reading stale sword-and-magic fantasies that give the genre and Tolkien a bad name, more of his elves and dwarves and little heroes who just happen to have EVERYTHING going in their favor. More magical ""things"" to go on a quest for, for no apparent reason. More ""oh, my family was killed. bummer"" and ""oh, I must save the beautiful elven princess because she has absolutely nothing to do with anything!"" This plot was a complete failure. There's no cause and reaction, just a bunch of ""I have to do this because it's my destiny"" drivel.The writing itself isn't anything overly impressive, either. I became irritated by the end of the prologue. As other reviewers have said, too many adverbs and avoidances of ""said"", which is a sin for all writers except the grandmasters. The Shades speak in boring monotone, with overused phrases like ""[Insert command here], or die."" (What kind of villainous name is ""shade"", anyway? Gee, really original.) I don't need to know that Eragon was angry, I need to be able to see in my head his facial reaction and deduce that he was angry. The theme is too shallow, the writing is too mediocre, and if it weren't for all the undeserved hype of this thing, I would've left it in the bookstore.Not even considering the sequel.

Her supporters act as if her sound is original; however, she told the truth when she said ""Back to Black"" no matter how she attempted to disguise the true meaning with her lyrics that she somehow goes blank in regard to that relationship.

That being said, I was sorry to hear of her passing so young with so much life ahead of her but in some ways I think her addiction was guilt driven; afterall, she knew her style and material was not original.

R2GOP8L2EGXP6U,"Unfortunately, as  we are still on lockdown,  I can’t go to the shops and buy one in person for... half the price! I can’t believe I paid £14.99 (at time of review) for this.Why I am not sending it back? Because I can’t stand the mess on my desk any longer, so, I’ll use it. But believe me, if there had been no lockdown, I would have sent it back as soon as I opened it and would have headed to the nearest pound shop.First of all, it is small, though my mistake, I relied on the seller’s pictures and the pictures in the reviews instead of checking the measurements.Second, it is cheaply made. The little square drawer catches and is stiff to open and the finish is not very well done.  Also, it can’t even hold a business card.Thirdly, unless you have a carton back up on your A4 and put it upright, loose sheet of A4 just collapse. See my picture. Of course, I could have cleverly put a ruler in front of the papers...Lastly, it is not that sturdy. Easy to bend. It is not even pretty in real life. Just white mesh.My advice is that if you can wait, go to any home stores, market or pound shops and buy the same thing  for maybe a fiver or less.Believe me, If you saw this in a store for £14.99, you wouldn’t buy it.How did this get so many glowing reviews?Granted, it is useful but it is not that special and the fact remains that it is a cheap item. We have the right to expect quality for £15. So, a total rip off.I know that one star is a bit harsh. If the item had been priced up to £5.99 , I might have rated it 2 or 3 stars.

RVQNB8PJ5PPF4,"I at first gave this product 5 stars, because once you get your images printed on the paper, it does beautifully in transferring them to your sublimation blanks. The colors are great and everything looks fabulous.HOWEVER:  I started out sublimating on an Epson Workforce 30. After a couple weeks, I noticed I was having trouble getting the paper to feed through the printer. I figured there was something wrong with the printer, so I called Epson and since they don't make the Workforce 30 anymore, they 'upgraded' me to a WF-2530.  I got the printer, it printed about a dozen prints and stopped taking the paper through the printer, just like the Workforce.  I again blamed the printer, it was under warranty so they swapped me for another printer, and about 5 prints in, it stopped wanting to take the paper again. I decided Epson printers were no good for the paper thickness, so I ordered a Canon. Guess what? It also did not want to feed this paper.  So after wasting way too much money on refillable ink cartridges and expensive sublimation ink for three different printers, I have concluded that the problem is not the printers, it's this paper.  So if you can get your printer to take this paper, you'll be happy with the results. IF YOU CAN GET YOUR PRINTER TO TAKE THIS PAPER!",0,0,0,0

R1R183RT6AVCO,"I was torn between giving this 5 stars or only 1 star.  I so deeply respect the long hours, passion, and heart and academic excellence that Richard Lyman Bushman put into this labor of love.  I great admire Richard L. Bushman.  This is a ""must"" book for anyone who wants to study early LDS Church history.  I would rank it in the top ten essentials; Richard Lyman Bushman's epic work should be called a masterpiece.The reason I gave it only 1 star is because RLB puts forth the opinion that Brother Joseph Smith had more than one wife; I feel he did not.  I appreciate that the Historical Department of the LDS Church has just released in November, 2014, a document giving the opinion that Brother Joseph had more than 30 wives; I respectfully disagree with the LDS Church History Department.  Since 1830, when the Church and Priesthood of God were Restored, the LDS Church has gone back and forth on if Brother Joseph had more than one wife.  First he (and the Church) said he did not, then after his death, the Utah LDS Church said he did, then there was a phase when they said he did not, and now we are back to the opinion that he did.  I long for the day when the LDS Church History Department will correct itself, and again defend the Prophet of God Brother Joseph Smith that he did not have more than one wife.In researching, of a person who was born over 200 years ago, who died 170 years ago, there is very little actual factual evidence available.  Yes, there are written journals, and 2nd and 3rd hand accounts written in newspapers or family hand me down traditions, but these are all subject to question, as humans write with an agenda and a self promoting perspective.  What some call ""truth"" or ""facts"" from events that happened 170 years to 200 years ago misuse the words ""truth"" and ""facts"" unless they have actual science to back it up.For example, the claim is made by some sincere writers, that Brother Joseph had between 30 to 80 wives (one of his ""supposed"" wives is quoted as saying he had ""80"").  Where is the ""science"" to back up this claim of 30 to 80 wives?  In analyzing historic events from 170 to 200 years ago, if you do not have real ""Science"" to back up claims, then you only have ""speculation"".  To call ""speculation"" a ""fact"" or ""truth"" tarnishes historical research.Let us pause to talk about the ""available Science"" of the question if Brother Joseph Had more than one wife.  The only true Science is from DNA testing.  A number of the people who slandered Brother Joseph's name with accusations that he had more than one wife, were the very same people that ""claimed"" ""other wives"" bore him children.  Guess what!  Science, through DNA testing, has shown that none of the ""Supposed"" children of Joseph with his ""supposed"" other wives were his.  None were.  So if these people who claimed Joseph had children with other wives were wrong about that, then why should we believe them at all. In a modern Court case, their credibility would have been breached and the case thrown out; Brother Joseph would have been vindicated.Here is where truth is found.  From 1831 (the supposed start of polygamy) to 1844 (when Brother Joseph went in The Spirit World), Brother Joseph was ""supposed"" to be having intimate husband and wife physical relations with up to 80 + 1 (Emma) wives.  Now during this 1831 to 1844 period of time, Brother Joseph was having children each couple of years with his wife Emma.  But.....not ....one with these other 80 ""supposed"" wives; this is a statistical impossibility on a metric scale.  Especially...since...many of these same women were bearing children to other men over the same time period; another statistical impossibility on a metric scale.  There is your ""truth"" and your ""facts"" by reason of Science.  There is absolutely not one thread of ""fact"" or ""truth"" from a viewpoint of Science that proves Brother Smith had more than one wife; Science though does say he did not.Well, you may say, ""What about Section 132?""  To understand history, you have to understand history.  The other epic books on polygamy, like this one, fail to address this key part of the polygamy historical events atmosphere. Without understanding Section 132, it is impossible to ""frame"" the events of polygamy into a correct historical atmosphere.  Bushman and the other sincere writers, ""suppose"" that Brother Joseph wrote Section 132. He did not.Section 132 was brought forward in 1852 by President Young and his polygamy supporters. In fact, Section 132 was not included into The Doctrine and Covenants until 1876; yes I said 1876.  So brother Joseph ""supposedly"" received this revelation in 1831, and does not record it until 1843, when it then gets lost until 1852, then gets published in 1876.  Show me another doctrine like that; bogus sez I.Also at that time in 1876, Section 101 was altered and a statement ""against"" polygamy ratified by Brother Joseph while is was on earth, was removed.  So please understand that The Doctrine and Covenants that was used during Brother Joseph's life, which taught against polygamy, was altered after his transferring to The Spirit World......which altered his view against polygamy.Besides altering Brother Joseph's teachings against polygamy in Section 101, there are verses in Sections 42 and 49 that also support that Joseph was against polygamy.  So, during Brother Joseph's time, we have Sections 101, 42, and 49 telling us one man and one wife; a ""consistent"" Gospel doctrine flow.  Then after Joseph goes to The Spirit World, we lose the truths in Section 101, get the ""pro"" polygamy in Section 132, but still retain the ""anti"" polygamy in Sections 42 and 49; ""a non-consistent"" Gospel doctrine flow.  Show me where scripture verses about Tithing or the Sabbath are not consistent.  My point is made.To understand the ""framing"" of history regarding polygamy, one has to understand that the LDS Church was on the ropes, with some Utah members returning to Illinois to be part of the RLDS Church (not yet known by that title).  So Brother Brigham and others manufactured some history, and altered some history to save Zion; they did the best they could in difficult times.  Prophets are human, and are not perfect.  Brother Young was Prophet of God who had to battle hard spiritual wars against satan to keep The Church afloat; in war sometimes you lose a battle to win the war.  Sometimes in war ""truth"" is relative to survival.Part of altering history was to create a false narrative that Brother Joseph practiced polygamy.  For this to happen false affidavits were created and journals rewritten to support that Brother Joseph had more than one wife. It was time to circle the wagons and rally around the flag; if they did not support the polygamy narrative, I expect they were fearful of being thrown to the dogs. That is how I see it.Now someone will say, what about the ""supposed"" deathbed confession of one of his ""Supposed"" other wives?  My reply is Emma gave a deathbed statement stating he did not have more than one wife; so we can throw this and that around but I return to the only true facts of Science, that DNA shows children only through Emma.My deepest respects to those who see this differently.I have had two strong Spiritual Witnesses that Brother Joseph did not have more than one wife.  We live by The Spirit, or we just exist in His Church. We should live by The Spirit, which I trust more than words written by the arm of flesh.I do feel really bad for those who leave The Church because they believe the lies that Brother Joseph married 80 women, some of which were 14 years old.  He was only married to Emma; therefore he did not marry any 14 years old.  I feel bad for the ""investigators"" who read harsh books claiming Brother Joseph had more than one wife; they can't feel The Spirit because they have built up a wall of resentment.  Then they will not follow Moroni's promise to prayerfully ponder and pray over The Book of Mormon (after having liken the Scriptures to themselves, and reflected on how great The Blessings from The Lord have been: this is part of the Eternal Formula for receiving a Spiritual Witness; too many only read and pray and neglect the pondering and remembering their Blessings from God).Regardless, as a Church History Hobbyist, Polygamy is not a line in the sand for me.  My line in the sand is The Spirit of The Lord I feel when I do my Home Teaching each month; my line in the sand is the warm glow of The Spirit I feel each Sunday when I partake of the Sacrament; my line in the sand is The Spirit of The Lord I feel when I participate in the Sacred Temple Ordinances of The House of The Lord; my line in the sand is The Spirit I feel when we hold Family Home Evening each Monday night; my line in the sand is The Spirit of The Lord I feel when I Fast (and especially pay a generous Fast Offering), and finally, my line in the sand is when I feel The Spirit of The Lord as I read The Book of Mormon (11years in a row), and The Holy Bible (KJV) (5 years in a row).  Again, as I said earlier; we either live by The Spirit, or we only exist in His Church.  We obtain The Spirit through Faith and Obedience, and also by defending the Prophet of God; Joseph Smith (and also President Brigham Young).So come back to the LDS Church; reclaim your Priesthood that you were Ordained in the pre-earth life to have once you came to earth to get your body.You would enjoy my Christian Indie movie trailer on Youtube; ""Sisters Go Ye trailer 2.""Please go to Church on Sunday; Praise The Lord.Numbers 6:22-27Wisdom of Solomon 16:26Brother Kyle",0,0,0,0

R20F98ZDC49G4Q,"The book is neither clever, artful nor suspenseful. It’s set up to make that possible, but falls completely short. Anna’s friends are kidnapped from their campsite and, with little in the way of provisions or resources, it’s up to our wily ranger to save the day.Instead, she relies almost entirely on what the captives can secretly leave behind in the way of food, weapon, etc. She knows nothing of what’s edible in the wild? She’s oblivious to how to fashion a weapon from stone and wood? She can’t come up with a ruse to lure a bad guy to his demise and end this early on, or devise some way to attract authorities? Perhaps what epitomizes how obtuse the protagonist is is the episode where she stabs one of the antagonists in the right side of the back, hoping to hit his heart.Her companions, supposedly brilliant women, aren’t much more astute. A crippled woman, confined to crawling on the ground, sets a grass fire, hoping the flames will reach up and have sufficient heat at that high level to set off the fuel tanks in an airplane’s wing. Fat chance. The tires are right there at your level. Burn them. While somewhat dull-witted, the women appear to have the resilience of Schwarzenegger in body armor because no bullet, rifle butt, fist or other weapon does them serious harm, in spite of almost constant application.This is an ugly mixture of sensationalistic sadism and endless agonizing passages by a few characters, with little in the way of the craft of writing.

R2ZNSBRI8SQM1K,"For me, this had the potential for a good book.

Unsure why others have had such good luck.  For me to fit business cards in I will have to either bend the edge of the card or cut them off.  Not very good build quality!",0,0,0,0

R2EUPVXSPELK0F,"I picked up this book thinking it would be laugh out loud hysterical. Instead, like many other reviewers, I was very disappointed. The books starts out in novel format and has her sorta of narrating in footnote old passages from her journal. I liked this. I thought it was quite funny and interesting. From there, she discussed issues with promoting her movie, Trainwreck, in which a lot of journalists argued that her character was not enjoyable and that she should have had Bill (from SNL) play that role instead of Amy. I do feel like she touched greatly on two issues that have quite personally affected her-- 1) Gun Control and 2) Body image/weight issues. If you read the chapter on guns, I can see her points of view. I just was not expecting this to be in a book that was sort of marketed to be ""funny"". It was just a serious issue. Perhaps the chapter would have worked better in another book, one with a more serious tone. For the body weight issues she has faced, I am on her side. I loved her writing on it. I would basically read the first few chapters, especially those where she discussed stand up comedy, and the chapter on body image. Those two chapters were great.Finally, I thought the book was too dang short. If you are gonna write a book, go all out. Make it long. It seemed the further along in the book you got, the less enjoyable it became. Glad I only paid $3 for it (I got a used copy).",0,0,0,0

RUVX86BOJLTJN,"NEW TATTOO(2000).Motley Crue's eigth(studio)album.By the year 2000,Motley Crue had seen and done it all. They had accidently killed their best friends in car accidents,they had beatun up their wifes and gotten arrested and charged with spousal abuse--you name it,and there is a good chance that either Vince Neil,Nikki Sixx,Tommy Lee,and/or Mick Mars had done it. And a year before the twenty-first century arrived,The Crue released a new studio album in the summer of 2000. How did the album meausure up? Read on for my review of this:This album,along with THEATRE OF PAIN,MC '94,and GENERATION SWINE,is a ""love it or hate it"" album. I'd also say that it is easily the worst album Motley Crue has EVER released. And while Nikki Sixx usually contributes most of the work to Motley Crue albums,the Crue member who probably did most of the work here is drummer Randy Castillo(RIP)who had been hired as Motley Crue's replacement drummer after Tommy Lee had quit the band to do his Methods of Mayhem project. Castillo was a good drummer(he died from complications of cancer in 2002)and when a replacement member of a band deserves the most credit for the first album the band that hired him for and had recorded with him,you know that's not a good sign.The only good tracks on here(whether or not I like the title track depends on the mood I am in while listening to it)are the opener HELL ON HIGH HEELS,FAKE,and their cover of The Tubes' WHITE PUNKS ON DOPE(it is one of their best cover songs)--everything else here is just really bad. And while the lyrics are quite stupid also,how many agree with me that the dialogue on TREAT ME LIKE THE DOG I AM and PORNO STAR is annoying? Apart from the good songs on this CD,the songs here just sound unispired and are all quite stupid-I wouldn't say that Motley Crue was exactly returning to their original sound on this album. Them returning to their original sound shows at times during this record,but with this CD,after listening to it,it may seem a little apparent that Vince Neil,Nikki Sixx,and Mick Mars wanted half of this album to sound like their original material(DR. FEELGOOD,GIRLS,GIRLS,GIRLS,etc.)while they wanted half of it to sound like the kind of rock music that was popular back in 2000-they didn't want us to think that,but guess what--we caught what they were hoping we wouldn't be able to tell after their fans had listened to this record.Overall,a dreadful CD that could have been and should have been totally better--Vince Neil,Nikki Sixx,and Mick Mars should have put more effort into this CD then they really did. And here is the bottom line:get their new two disc greatest hits set RED,WHITE,AND CRUE--that way,you will get HELL ON HIGH HEELS and the single version of the title track off of this album,and then download the other two good tracks on this album(the tracks that I mentioned at the top of this review,and the bonus tracks here--if you want them)and then skip the rest. Now that Tommy Lee is back with the band,hopefully Vince Neil,Nikki Sixx,and Mick Mars will make a new,decent studio album that WILL sound more like DR. FEELGOOD,GIRLS,GIRLS,GIRLS,etc.(I always found MC '94 to be underappreciated--I liked GENERATION SWINE,but I can see why some(or most)Crue fans don't care for it). Enough said--although I am looking forward for seeing The Crue in concert one month from now).",0,0,0,0

R3VVBPVMA5TUPX,"Let me say this up front: I pretty-much hated this movie. I have never read the books and I don't plan to after seeing the movie. That being said, my review is a bit of a rant, though I bear no ill will to anyone, including the film makers.With that out of the way, let's get down to business. Inkheart was a terrible movie, mostly due to its ridiculous premise. The premise is that there are some people in the world who have the power read things from books into reality. Cool right? Wrong, because there's a catch: everytime you read something in, something from our world goes into the story world. To top it off, the readers with this power have no control over who comes in or goes out. This means that they cannot read any work of fiction out-loud with out characters popping in and loved-ones popping out. Poor Mortimer Folchart has this exact situation thrust upon him: one night, he read a villain from the book Inkheart into our world and his wife disappeared into the book. The movie, also called Inkheart, tells of his quest to find another copy of the book so that he can read his wife back in. Accompanied by his annoying daughter, he takes a mostly pointless journey and ultimately succeeds in getting back his wife.As a variant of the fantasy genre, the movie has potential but its execution falls flat. Much of the narrative is messy; I spent a decent amount of time confused about what was going on. The action scenes are weak and poorly executed and I had little investment in any of the characters except for Dustfinger, a magician who is desperately trying to get back into his book. The modern setting was a bit of a mismatch; it would have fit better in a medieval setting because the juxtaposition of the fantasy elements with the modern ones was not very good. The film's ensemble cast, which incudes the likes of Brendan Fraser, Andy Serkis, Paul Bettany, and Helen Mirren is mostly wasted.But the ultimate reason why I hated this film was the climax. *SPOILER ALERT* Remember how those special readers can make books into reality? Well turns out that it works with anything that they read, including their own writing, which means that if they write anything down and read it out loud, it becomes reality. And guess who figures this out and learns to control it? The incredibly annoying daughter. (In her own defense, I think she was supposed to be annoying. If so, she deserves an Oscar.) In a horribly messy climax, she wraps up the entire plot, sending every character back to their respective books and defeating every villain, simply by reading her own writing. To say the least, I was abhorred. The power went from reading people in and out of books by accident, to near-omnipotence where this girl literally speaks and things are created. There was also no explanation for why nobody was accidentally read into any stories there at the end. It's like the writers were changing the rules of the story as they went and to place the fate of every character into the hands of an annoying little girl!? What a tragedy. I was honestly offended at the end as I asked myself, ""How stupid do they think we are?""I honestly had high hopes for Inkheart. The cast was diverse and acclaimed, and the story sounded very promising. But after watching the film, I cannot recommend this movie to anyone.",0,0,0,0

When the aliens attacked, they did things that any idiot would never do and they just died.  The only character that I actually liked was the one who had the weird eyes (the killer).  The creators also didn't put into account that the aliens were hurt by light.  Only once did the light bother them, and that one was already dead.  The only reason that I gave this 2 stars was because the special effects saved it.  The rest was stupid.  My suggestion is to never see this movie...ever.",0,0,0,0
R1D7C4ZG1Y8WAY,"I purchased this book soley for the fact that the success of Eragon was largely based on the hype surrounding the author's, Christopher Paolini, young age during the time of the novel's writing. I'm also a dedicated fantasy/sci-fi writer (a highschool junior) whose work will never be published, and call it an ego thing perhaps, but I wanted to see how this critically acclaimed novel compared to my own work. I was also fully aware of the several reviews making Eragon out to be nothing more than a poorly written rehash of several mainstream fantasy novels, and yet my curiosity urged me to drop the fifteen dollars required to read it...I was dissapointed. Massively.The book is rife with glaring grammatical errors that even I, someone who is horrible at proof reading, could pick out while reading. Also, his selection of words is suspect at best. It almost seems as if a highschool vocabulary book was used as a refrence to plug in as many sophisticated sounding words in place of simpler words. The problem is that sometime these words are used inappropiately, making the sentences in question sound down right ridiculous at times.Perhaps I could overlook that as my own writing is periodically victim to the same mistakes, but I can not ignore the blatant cliches and ""borrowing"" from other fantasy books. You have your stereotypical boy, Eragon, whose village is destroyed by an evil empire and is destined to save the world with a dragon he coinicidentially found (he has secret magical powers too), fall in love with the elven maiden, etc. etc. I struggled to find a single original element within the entire story.I suppose the book isn't completely without redemption. It was long afterall, and while I didn't think of it as a good fantasy book, I did satisfy my curiosity as to the quality of the book. It also leaves me with the dillema if I should bother pursuing Eragon's sequel. More things to think about.In conclusion, I can't honestly recommend this book to anyone except hardcore fantasy readers who like extremly thick books, or to people who can endure repetitive fantasy cliches without flinching. To the rest, look elsewhere.",0,0,0,0

After I got a replacement for this one thinking that it was just a one time thing I was only partially right.  While the provided ink still dripped like a water faucet my noodlers ink worked after almost thirty minutes of coaxing.  Since then I have only refilled it twice but it has never smoothly gone through a full cartridge without drying out for no plain reason.  I have a cheap little plastic fountain pen that so far works without fail and uses the ink cartridges that this pen couldn't without issue.

R2D0IENM860WN6,"Brought to you by OBS reviewer HeidiOn the Rocks was a great bar and hang out for the workers at the nearby office buildings and they had a great happy hour.  Except on this day all the patrons started getting angry and fighting.  They started killing each other.  When Eve Dallas arrived on scene it looked like the remnants of a battlefield.  What happened here?  What caused all these people to attack one another?  And, how soon before it happens again?Eve and Peabody are once again on the case, along with their favorite civilian consultant, Roarke, who of course owns the bar (because he does own about everything)!  Over 80 people died in the attack and they feel their mass murderer is just getting started.  They’re racing against the clock before their murderer strikes again.  This verges on being a terrorist act and the HSO wants in on the case, knowing Eve’s terrible past with the HSO this could prove problematic.  However, in the end, Eve will do what’s best for the victims because they are hers now and she will get justice for them and do her best to prevent other senseless deaths.I was pretty bored throughout a majority of this book, it was way too easy to put down, and I even fell asleep a few times! I could probably chalk a lot of that last bit up to the fact that I run myself ragged and don’t get nearly enough hours of shut-eye, but it doesn’t bode well for the book either.  I need the emotion back in this series!  You can always tell when it’s missing because I get bored out of my mind.  There were a few moments between Eve and Roarke that gave me a good chuckle, but it’s not the same as the gut-wrenching emotion we’ve seen between them in the past.And, surprisingly Eve and Summerset put aside their bickering for the better good of solving this case.  These attacks had some similarities to ones perpetrated by a vicious cult during the Urban Wars.  It’s a time that Summerset wishes he could forget about, but the memories and terror are still very much alive inside himself.  He’s willing to relive it all if it helps stop the madman they face now.The story did improve toward the end, but not enough to make up for the rest of it.

REVQZDGLV67TH,"This chart is very confusing.  There are a lot of questions about using it for multiple children, and the responses given seem very misleading.  I'm actually using it for just one child, but I don't really see how it would work for more than one child.There are spaces for chores on the left of the chart.  Then there's a column for each day of the week across the top.  There's one extra column at the far right.At the bottom it shows a little space to record ""Names"" as though it's for multiple children.  There are 4 different colored stars depicted next to the lines, which sort of makes me feel like there should be a star for each child.  There isn't.  There are only two star magnets, and they are as depicted.  They're a little bit larger than the spaces.  I just don't understand what they are for.  You wouldn't use them to check off chores completed - there are only two of them.  Maybe to indicate which chore each child should complete?  But then there should be four magnets to match the four names.  Two star magnets that are a bit bigger than the spaces...?  We ended up using the star magnets on the fridge.And finally - the dry erase marker.  The quality of the actual marker is good, but the star stamp side doesn't work.  It's hard, not like a sponge.  It would work on paper, but on another hard surface, it's impossible to make a star stamp.  Very disappointing as I thought - Oh well if I don't get what the star magnets are for.

This series started out good, and has slowly gone downhill. I'll be honest and say that I didn't finish this book. The story just didn't hold my attention. Most disconcerting was the switch from first person to third person narration.My suggestion to readers wanting to start this series would be to read the first 3-4 books only (up to the start of the Temple Gault storyline) and then stop. In my opinion, these are the best of the series. Why? Beacuse there was actual detective work and crime solving going on, instead of the monotonous ""woe is me"" introspection and political infighting and manuvering of the later books. Because Lucy had not yet become the female version of ""Dirty Harry."" Because there was a lot less bickering going on. And speaking of that, how does Marino end up being promoted to Deputy Chief?

Not because of the tragedies heaped on the characters. I did not expect a fluffy ending tied with a pink bow. What I expected was a modicum of respect for me as a reader.My main reason for hating it so much is this: All the set-ups were empty promises! The author had no idea how wrap things up. I felt she was terrified of confrontations. Because nothing gets resolved. All the fantastic threads of Part A become a tangled mess in Part B and the end was another big set-up that screamed of ""Go buy the sequel!""I know it is hard to believe my critique after so many reviewers raved about this book. The thing is, I totally understand why - the book is wonderfully written but it should come with a big warning tag that says: MAJOR FRUSTRATION AHEAD!Here are the things that killed the book for me:1.

And of course in his letter he said, ""This is not something to be discussed in a letter."" Arggg...)2. The long list of sub-characters with their endless thoughts - not important in the end. You can skip them - trust me! Especially that boring Jane character.3. The counter-hero the author developed throughout the book - gets nothing. Goes to waste. So why did the author tell us about him anyway?4. The heroine, Bab, changes abruptly from the person I rooted for and felt for to something unrecognizable and unbelievable. From a misguided teenagers who insists on marrying the wrong man, she becomes her grandmother's pawn, because having lost faith in her own judgment (and if you read the book you will understand why), she totally loses control over her life, her wants, her dreams for the future. I felt that Bab just lost it at some point. She gave up (at 20!) She didn't know what to do with herself and so handed the reins to her grandmother and did what the old woman said, which was basically to run away like a ditz. Another unbelievable twist since the grandma Alice had a wonderful life in which she was a queen in control. Bab began as a sweet, spirited girl, and ended as a too-stupid-to-live mess of a woman. Did I say a total ditz?5. The slap-in-my face jump from the second before the great climax of the story to years ahead was just rude. That really pissed me off.I kept reading, hoping for resolutions - and never got them. The author pours research into the book as if the pages are vessels for repetitive descriptive details (how many times do I need to read about all the powders and rouges on the vanity table? of the flowers? the clouds? the furniture? the trees? the holidays season?) I could get a magazine for that. When i buy a book i want a story with characters that DO THINGS and  take charge of the pages.It felt as though  two different people wrote the book: the good Dr. Jekyll wrote Part A and the crazed Mr. Hyde wrote Part B. The good build-up totally disintegrated in the end.This is not good literature. I don't care what people say. Look up Aristotle's POETICS and find out why. This book was worse than bad - it insulted my intelligence.Having read DARK ANGELS and raved about it with my review, I immediately bought the next 2 books in the series. Having read this book, I threw the 3rd - a brand new book - into my trash can without a second thought. I am not treating myself to more abuse from this author.",0,0,0,0

RFQRRGXM4YXVP,"Product works fine after I got the right customer service person to resolve my problems, which took a while. The instructions that came with it were wrong. I tried the service and figured out that was not for me; but then I had a very hard time cancelling the service. To understand what some of the problems are, I suggest that you google ""how to cancel service for ooma"" to see what kind of problems people have and that this is a problem for a number of people.  In general, the bad parts are:1. you cannot cancel on-line.2. You get a runaround when you call.3. It takes a long time on the phone to cancel.4. They push this idea of giving you a transfer number so that if you sell the device, the person will not have to pay activation fees.  The catch is, if you don't sell it, you get charged for all those months.  They are not very clear about that part.I'd give it a higher rating, as the service seems fine, but I felt like they were trying to trick me and cheat me.Also for the price that has standard features, you might as well get a cell phone from someplace like Republic Wireless that uses WiFi when you are connected, but uses the sprint network otherwise.  Its about $20 a month, including a gig of data on the wireless network.  Its less money and you can take your phone with you!",0,0,0,0
R1I7MBQUHRCO1G,"Brian De Palma fans praise ""Body Double"" (1984) for all the wrong reasons. Except for a few stylish sequences, the director's self-indulgent thriller belongs on the celluloid junk heap. De Palma rips off Hitchcock's ""Vertigo"" and ""Rear Window"" (along with his own ""Dressed to Kill"") in shameless fashion.

Of the one's I've used, 2 of them were dried out (or nearly dried out) and as such, the tips frayed when I tried to use them. And one of the green ones arrived with a frayed tip. So while that one has enough ink, I can't make smooth or thin lines. Then two more have dried up after using them a few times (so they weren't full).

RH0KB4VCXE8CR,"Very nice mouse pad, especially for the price. You can't really go wrong with this pad- it helps relieve pressure from your wrist so you're less likely to get hand cramps or have your hand fall asleep. It's a convenient size too so that it'll nicely fit on your desk without forcing you to make more room for it. The little bump out on the left of the pad aids in the natural movements of the mouse so you will be able to use your mouse without falling off of the pad. The bottom has a slightly sticky rubber to keep the pad in place on your desk but will not leave any residue. If you need a mousepad with some gel wrist support for a good cost, you won't be disappointed with this one. JETech has always come through with simple and cost effective products for people who need something and don't have specific demands- great for offices.UPDATE: I've had this mousepad for longer than a year but with less than average use. Like other reviewers' pads it has come undone at the bottom with the gel coming out. I can no longer recommend this mousepad.

R2961955FRU2OM,"Just off the top of my head, here is a list of impossible or very stupid  things that happen in this mindless rip-off of the Alien series: 1 - a  trinary star system with multiple planets in seemingly stable orbits (at  least they were stable enough for life to develop). 2 - a starship flying  through the emptiness of space on autopilot, happens to end up a stone's  throw away from not one, but TWO large planets.  To top that off, not even  a single beep from the computer to warn the human crew about this dangerous  course. 3 - in one of those great examples of Hollywood's ""what can we  do to establish that this is a 'SCI-FI' movie without bothering to do any  tedious research, or actually having to come up with a culture for these  people to live in?"" thinking, one of the planets has a ring near its  north pole.  I would be grateful if the writer would explain to me how  something like this happens. 4 - how exactly did these creatures manage to  wipe out every trace of life on the planet, working on a ten-hour day once  every twenty years?  And what have they been living on since then? 5 - how  did a creature that's deathly afraid of the light manage to become a top  player on this world in the first place? ........  Please don't bother  telling me these are minor plot holes.  They aren't.  I won't even go into  the minor plot holes right now.  The physics of the planetary system  basically ARE the premise of the story, so it would have been nice if  somebody had stopped to think about them.  Maybe about fifty years ago this  kind of story would have been accepted as SF, but we know a lot more these  days.  You can't just make things up and say ""hey, it's sci-fi.""  This is not a science fiction movie.  It's a horror movie, and a pretty  dumb one too. It uses every one of the standard superpredator movie shots,  included heavy-handed misuse of the Creature POV ""isn't it cool how  the creature visualizes differently from a human"" shot.

R1TA8WVMGSZYA8,"I was going to give this one star, but there are a two things about this show that worked. One is the casting. Shannen Doherty, Holly Marie Combs, and Alyssa Milano were such a good combo. They had great chemistry as sisters. This is the only reason I watched until that is ruined amongst other things later on that you'd think would improve with time rather than get worse. But anyway... The second and last good thing about this show was the witch stuff. Finally witches are shown as good and are actually heroes in this show. In fact, their mission was (at this time) to save people and other witches (including themselves) from danger and death by demons and warlocks, etc. Even though this isn't an accurate portrayal of real life witches, it still is far better than the stereotypical crap shown on television before...that is if you haven't seen Buffy's ""Willow"" character at this point (At the time of this show's premiere, Willow was barely becomming a real witch (not practicing), but she unfortunately lost her title of good witch eventually so I can't include her).The witch 'stuff' on Charmed was at least a refreshing change of pace, which like the girls' chemistry, is also turned into utter crap with time as opposed to IMPROVING. But I suppose that's just Aaron Spelling for ya. Eventually the series moves in 'new and risky' directions like: semi-skanky clothing, moronic bad guys (that act bigger than they are in cheesy and cheesier ways), more emphasis on breasts, boobs, and eventually 'funbags'(inside joke), mindless filler, crappier writing that gets crappier as each season progesses (picture garbage dump getting higher and higher), cheesy and bizarre changes that involve bringing fairytales and greek mythology into the mix (what that has to do with WITCHES is beyond any human answer I could give you, and the way they use those two things is just plain old-fashioned retarded.), and completely trashing the sisterly dynamic the show once had along with their Wiccan heritage.What else is there? This DVD is only for those who don't own vcr's or dvdr's. Seriously, I won't be buying this set of ZERO special features! I know there were problems between cast members mid-way through the show, but no special features AT ALL?? And here I thought the lack of features on the first few BTVS dvd sets were bad! No deleted scenes, no commentary, no interviews, no nothing! For shame. I was looking forward to buying this for the extras they might include (like the pilot without Alyssa Milano, as another person here suggested), but now? Don't think so!One more thing. To whoever wrote those handful of GOOD episodes of this show: I thank you all for writing them. There are a few in this dvd set that show the potential this show could've capitolized on to become something better, but oh well.And last but not least I want to give my sympathies to Rose McGowan and Holly Marie Combs, who don't deserve this kind show on their resume. As for Alyssa Milano? Well, maybe she'll think twice about letting her mother dictate her life and stick with her future castmate(s) desires to improve the show they're on. Yes, that's right, the bad girl of the nineties, Shannen Doherty, wanted to NOT torture the fans anymore than we were already being tortured, with the 'insane' notion of improvement...which of course lead to her becoming an executive producer...er, getting fired.

R1WHELNTG8ZMK1,"This should be a zero rating. It appears that poor quality control renders item useless as an adjustable stool.The best two things that can be said are: (1) that it works as a single height stool; (2) customer service answers emails promptly.The stool arrived in good condition. There are slightly different versions of the assembly instructions - one online and one with the kit.  This causes confusion.  A critical piece of information is missing from both: the orange cap  is not removed.  The illustration of which cap to remove is not to scale and appears to indicate the orange cap on the piston.In this case, the cylinder piston was inoperative. The company sent another without argument.  It arrived 7 or more days later  which defeats the purpose of having Amazon Prime for speedy delivery.Taking apart a forcefit assembly requires muscle, padding, and a non-marrying mallet.  You can add $25 to $45 dollars to the cost for a good mallet unless you think the company will accept a dented return.The second cylinder worked but only after another round of assembly and disassembly.  Sitting and bouncing on the chair did not activate the piston as per the optimistic instructions. A sound wack on the orange cap  with the mallet did.Still, the stool did not work. A final disassembly found that the weld for the seat adjusting lever was crooked.  It did not make contact with the piston.  No easy fix.Customer service has not been contacted about the second quality control failure.  If they read this and want to send another seat assembly I'll edit the rating.  It's not worth the time, effort, or expense to go through another round of emails or to box up the unit and send it back.Seriously considering giving the stool a Viking funeral then have an artist friend render the remains with company logo and address into an art piece for the local gallery.",0,0,0,0

R2MG0PNC6JUHSE,"How the heck did Diana Krall ever have a singing career let alone be the top-selling jazz vocalist in recent years?  She's awful!  She comes in with these low, soft vocals like she's in a cigar store, but the truth is she sings flat off key; she's weak, lacks body, and can't even find her own pitch.  And, it's great that there's such an excellent production on this CD, ""The Girl in the Other Room,"" but the voice of Mickey Mouse would've been more interesting.  She can't hit a note to save her life.  Why can't she take some singing lessons?  The small but excellent band along with the CD's excellent recording brings out every lacking thing about Ms. Diana Krall.  Maybe she's good for people who have no ear for tone and don't know what a well-trained voice will sound like.  Her success is good for the money, and so she gets produced.  She lacks even the natural ability some of today's pop singers seem to possess without much formal training.  Krall seems to have no interest in voice education; her wimpy voice agitates like the grinding of metal.Also, who is she to sing jazz?  Who's her audience?  Maybe she gets marketed well.  I just don't get her success from what she does as ""stylish.""  Popularity doesn't mean critically good.  While some singers may not have all the training one would hope, she's just awful.  Why is a white Canadian blonde singing an American art like this in the first place?  How do her consumers justify her (other than general insanity, I mean)?  Does she come from an economically-impoverished background?  Does she have some connection to the civil rights movement?  What does she know about the blues?  Apparently she just likes Edward G. Robinson on a bridge on a foggy night--film noir.  So what of it?  Krall is a joke.  She hasn't a fiber of anything even resembling Julie London.  Whenever I listen to her, I find myself getting angry and saying, ""Why doesn't she cut out the cinematics and just sing the song?""  I don't think that's possible.  She also makes frequent mistakes playing the piano as well.  She should take some college courses in Communications.  Musicians other than Diana Krall of this disc: Five-Star Rating.

RYR0QSB1QAI49,"This pencil sharpener did not last for me, and while it was working, it didn't do the best job.  There's better pencil sharpeners out there. I'd hardly go by the reviews that were just testing this out--check out the reviews that used this one for an extended time, like in a classroom such as I have.It's not the sharpener's fault that they don't make pencils like they used to, and many have off-center leads.  However, you can get sharpeners that handle those pencils much better than this one did.  In a classroom setting, it was maybe sharpening about 70% of the pencils.  The other 30% it would sharpen down to nubs with no success.  The replacement that I got for this one sharpened about 98% of pencils.The motor on this one would also occasionally go out.  Granted, it would always come back on after resting.  In a matter of months, though, this one was really working hard to do the minimum.  There was a clear deterioration of the power and the motor.On the plus side, this one did keep chugging along, doing the bare minimum.  I ended up passing this one on to another teacher who was in a desperate situation, and she said she actually liked it.  The pencils were so difficult to sharpen that she could be assured no student was getting up to sharpen their pencil that didn't really NEED it sharpened.Now, it's not like this got used to death.  I have a small special education classroom, so it had moderate use.  It was also difficult for some of the children to align the pencil correctly, and some of the pencil-width settings seemed somewhat random and unnecessary--you could change the width with an inner wheel (the orange wheel you see in the picture on top), but the outer hole is fixed.  It's almost more of a gimmick than a real function.I'd recommend passing on this one--there's better sharpeners for a similar price that do a better job.",0,0,0,0
RQ77X163IKD0S,"One of the worst setup experiences of all the printers I've owned.  First of all, the ""quick setup"" sheet gives you inaccurate and criminally vague information.  The setup failed no less than two dozen times (I was getting close to 30 times--I kept count) using various methods - with USB, without USB, restarted wireless router multiple times (mind you, all other devices I disconnected from wifi before setup in case it would make a difference.  it did not).  The documentation is horrible.  See my photos--the problem was that the setup couldn't find the wireless printer.  Troubleshooting went only so far as anyone with common sense would guess--Check that the wireless setting is active on the printer.  Try restarting your wireless network.  Check to make sure the USB is connected if you're configuring wireless using the usb cable.  If all 3 of these fail--which they did, over two dozen times.  You're outta luck.  This is literally a piece of garbage  and I should not have ignored the poor recent reviews.Do yourself a favor and take a HARD PASS on this one.  I have no idea how long this will actually function and when it will mysteriously disconnect from the wifi again.  It gets 2 starts because the printing is actually quite fast even for a laser printer.This is going right back into the box for a return.  Not worth the trouble, or the time it took to get this to work.  Utter garbage.  These should be pulled from inventory and destroyed.",0,0,0,0
RHXP2882Y3OM5,"Original, thought-provoking and daring were just some of the words from other viewers that lured me into seeing this self-adoring film.So lets explore these ideas(and, in keeping with the movie, you can hate ME for this review but my IDEAS are bullet-proof!!!Muwahaha!).....1) OriginalPAlease. Granted, the first twenty minutes I got kinda excited, hoping to see a clever script full of witty alliterations and matrix-like fight scenes but, looooooooong siiiiiiiiiiigh, I was greatly deceived. I conitinued to watch in dismay as the plot frolicked into the land of  I'm Trying So Hard Not To But I'm Just Like Every Other Film and the script happily  meandered into Chock-Full of Cliches and Loving It region. There's a violent murderer who really has a heart of gold and he wears a mask because he's scarred but holds beauty beyond the physical. He happens to be in the area to rescue a girl who happens to be beautiful and happens to work for the TV station he commandeers and happens to have a past full of rebellion. Yaaaaawn. Good thing no one believes in coincedence or else it would have been REALLY cheesy(winkwink). Of course we also have villians with 0 depth, corrupt clergy and politicians, oppressed minorities and a people rallying, sacrifical, bloody, huge explosion filled, staggering-to-the-one-you-love-just-to-be-able-to-utter-the-perfect-last-words ending. Are you asleep yet?Original? A+ for effort, F for execution.2) Thought ProvokingFirst, I will admit that V had several lines that made me smile or ponder a moment. But after his ridiculous usage of torture - the very thing that embittered him into his mission!!! - he rather lost all credibility to me. While V loathes the murderous society he lives in who kills people they don't approve of, he pracitces the same thing, killing those he doesn't approve of. He is different from them only in his opinion of what is right and wrong. He still enforces it in the same way they do - brute force. Its this character that the movie asks you to root for and beleive in... I just didn't buy it, but obviously, judging from its top of the box office 26.1million dollar opening, most everybody else did.Thought Provoking? Provoked me to just enough thought to write this review and then banish it from my mind forever.3) DaringSo it ""dared"" to ask the questions, ""What if another moraly fanatic control freak Hitler-type took over the world?""  and ""What if we were in a supremely controlled world where our every move was monitored by the government?"" I would say ""daring"" would mean if its a topic movie makers shy away from. Hardly. Just to name a few: The Manchurian Candidate, Gattaca, A.I., The Final Cut, Minority Report and of course, the Matrix Trilogy all explore this idea.Also, the whole thing was blown so out of proportion that it succeeded in paralleling no one. It was far too extreme to be daring. It took some things conservatives believe and blew it up so much that only a handful of people could actually relate. It pretended to be ""in your face"" with the truth but, honestly, no one seemed to take it personally but simply nodded thinking it was addressing ""someone else"". This is called the SECRET SAFE ROUTE - make yourself look like you're willing to say anything while offended a maximum of 1% of the population.Daring? Close but no cigar.Ok, so the total of the above is a big whopping F. However, there were a couple things that inched it up to a C- on my scale.1) Natalie Portman = lovely and believable performance, especially toward the beginning of the film. I think she will be one of those stars that just goes on forever, impressing if not a little shy of stunning us with her beautiful acting skills.2) The cinematoghrapy, costumes and setting = The usage of color in this movie is very nice. We have a dark feel overall, spotted with some reds and whites and just when it gets too dreary(for example, in Evey's cell), we get splashes of yellow and green(Valerie's story). All the outfits and colors fit the characters, although the Hitler-type motif was a little over the top. The city was appealingly clean and tidy yet chilling and lonely. The first blowing up of the building was unexpected eye-candy and Natalie's wardrobe stayed subtle, like her character.I don't mind so much if someone likes this movie(my boyfriend and my sister seem to enjoy it just fine) as long as you don't insult my intelligence by telling me its original, thought-provoking or daring.So, my View is that I am the Victim of this Valient effort, which Veered into Vanity and Verbosness, concluding with Virtually no Value.In short, V adored itself enough that none of us need to waste the effort.",0,0,0,0

R25LT875SQ9AXL,"I have to agree with previous reviews written so far for this book, I was shocked to find it so short and with a number of pages related to other books by the same author, including ones that seem to be similar and as previously suggested should have been included as part of this book at the price. The content of the book also did not deliver what I was expecting. Witchcraft is a very real issue and to find just about every reason under the sun to be a diagnosis for identifying it, seemed a bit much to believe and take on board. It is like some vitamin books that makes the reader far less equipped at knowing which vitamins are lacking, and yet they have just read a whole book on the subject. I personally find too many innocent and well meaning Christians are treated with suspicion simply because someone has read a book of this kind and then believe they are well equipped to discern the ""demons"" in others. The Holy Spirit is always the ONE who is able to give true and accurate assessing and discernment regarding spiritual and demonic activity when sought through fervent prayer, and this could lead to books to help us understand the subject. This book is not one I would recommend.",0,0,0,0

R1K2ZXQXPLG4B0,"Apparently this diet works for some people, but for me and a few other people I know, it didn't. I quit after Week 2 because I had not lost a pound. I could not bear wasting any more time when I knew my usual methods would work. I am 5'3 and normally weigh 133 lbs. but I like to weigh 115 lbs and can certainly do it if I give half effort. Just before I started the diet, I gained 5 pounds in a week because I was traveling and eating whatever I wanted (knowing I was going to be on a diet). I put weight on as fast as I take it off! Anyway, I started the diet and immediately lost that 5 lbs. in 4 days. Big deal, I could have done that eating the way I normally do, potato chips and all. 10 days later, I had not lost a SINGLE pound. In fact, when I was in Phase 2 and actually lost one pound in 2 days (like I always do with low carb eating), I put it right back on the next day in Phase 3. This diet requires a TON of preparation, time, and money. I am fortunate enough to afford the food, and have an organic grocery a few minutes away, but running to the store EVERY DAY because I realized I didn't have something I needed or had to substitute something I thought was okay was ridiculous. I racked up at least an $800 grocery bill just on myself between ""raw nut butters,"" ""buffalo,"" and ""sprouted grain tortillas."" The stress of making sure I was eating every 3 hours was ungodly for a working mother. And of course, one of the premises of the diet is, if you are stressed, you will hold onto weight--a RIDICULOUS notion if you think about it. Our ancestors were more stressed than we have ever been with worrying about whether the saber toothed tiger (or some other true threat) was going to attack--and obesity was unheard of. We will NEVER be low stress! This ""stress"" argument is similar to what us ladies hear at the gynecologist when the doctor can't figure out what is causing whatever symptoms--""it must be stress."" BS. If you are not used to eating multiple times per day, this diet is not for you. If you are trying to eat out or eat with others, it is not for you. If you want coffee, wheat, sugar, alcohol, or dairy--it's not for you. If you want to be sick of vegetables, salad, and meat, and not lose weight, it is definitely for you. The only reason I gave it an extra star was because it is absolutely ""healthy"" in the sense that it touts organic products, and eliminates the aforementioned problem foods. But it is not a weight loss plan for people who are not obese.",0,0,0,0
RBSMSIIZEKKMQ,"I bought this based on a suggestion from a friend that swears by his. Setup was easy but, it works only part of the time. I insert a document and then most of the time I have to reinsert the document because I am getting the no paper detected alert. Even though that is a pain, the software is easy to use and I can work with it. The software wants you to purchase a cloud plan to backup and enable features on the iphone app. I don't care about cloud backup or iphone features, because I use the scanner to report incoming checks and record expenses at my desk in my office and backup to an external hard drive. I did not extend the paid plan support after the trial has ended. I even have to opt out of the many reminder emails from Neat which is quite annoying. Now here comes the part that makes me angry: My older macbook pro dies. I have a backup of my neat software from my external hard drive and I think I'm in the clear. I buy a new macbook and install the neat software but when I log into the new software and enter my old login info, It says my Neat plan has expired. It seems my only choice... is to purchase a cloud plan from Neat and I am unable to open the program and can't get past the log in / purchase a plan screen. I take a few breaths, let's work the problem. I go to the Neat website and guess what?!!! I can not call for support, because you have to pay for extended service nor can I live chat with someone because (you guessed it) you have to pay for extended service. I will email the support link, it is free surprisingly.I would not recommend this unless you are willing to buy an expensive scanner then continue to pay for the honor of using the Neat software and pay additionally for customer support other than by email.I am giving this 2 stars because it will work and the software is easy to use, but I am not recommending this because of the lack of unpaid customer support and seeming greediness of the Neat company.

R1NLT3K85AIW1S,"Really glad I did not pay for this!I really don't understand how someone can write something and have SO many errors! The author uses ""Yay"" instead of ""Yeah"" and ""attached"" instead of ""attacked!"" Talk about killing the flow of the story. He completely overuses the word gross( WAY overused!); get a thesaurus please! I started out enjoying the story. But couple the above errors with even more grammar mistakes: ""six"" instead of ""Sick,"" and phrases that just ring terrible.Example: If Johnston’s oar wouldn’t have smashed into the creatures face when it did, the creatures teeth would have sunk into Walker’s arm. (not only is wouldn't have terrible grammar, we're also missing 2 apostrophes.) I also feel like the majority of the characters took FAR too long to realize these are zombies they are dealing with. Especially the soldiers on the nuclear sub. I was starting to get a bit annoyed with them! Also, it takes all the characters far too long to realize that bites turn you into one. Everyone with half a brain knows that! So, I felt like the characters were a bit dense in the beginning of the story. I really tried to continue the story, but.... “Johnston yelled, “Grab the bottom part and bring it along. It will be better than nothing.” Quotes out of place but also, ""it will be better than nothing!"" ?! The conversations just kept getting more and more lame.I  wanted to like the story and feel like the idea is a good one, just not at all well executed. Bill and Susan are very likeable and smart enough as a regular suburban couple trying to do the best for their children. (one reviewer mentions that the name of the child Frannie changes to Jenny-I have not run across that, but I will update this review if/when I do.) Matt and Jessie, wow...I am really enjoying hating Matt and also thinking that Jessie is an idiot!Conclusion: Author, you REALLY should get a proofreader.This could have been an enjoyable, well paced, and not overly gory zombie story.

R14GPRYYO8FO1R,"There is something very important the reader must know about Ilium before embarking on its journey: the book is not a stand alone book.  Rather, it's one story split into two books: Ilium and Olympos, and Ilium ends on a dramatic cliffhanger that resolves nothing. Why you should care about this is because the sequel, Olympos, is an awful book.  As in it's really, really bad - badly written, unlikable characters, whole chapters about nothing, and manages to be both boring and confusing at the same time. I honestly think the Olympos was ghost written by someone else paid to do the job, because the change in style when one reads straight though from Ilium into Olympos is extremely jarring. It doesn't seem like the same author.All of this is quite a shame because Ilium was a book I couldn't put down. It had brilliant ideas, was mostly well written, had interesting characters, plenty of mystery, and was basically the opposite of what Olympos ended up as. But since the story is effectively one story, and neither book stands on it's own, I feel the whole thing is tainted and I cannot recommend Ilium to others.I'm sure not many people will notice this little review, but it's the review I wish I saw before purchasing the book.",0,0,0,0

Rather childish acts by people who want others to think they are so smart.PZ Myers wrote a blog post titled Satan's Wiles on March 2nd. Then this book got a huge influx of 5 star reviews over the next few days.Then when someone gave a 1 star review in the middle of all the 5 star reviews the 1 star reviewer was attacked and all the 5 star reviewers voted each others comments up and voted the one star reviewers comments down. Total abuse of the system.This book is not a Bible or devotional. It is a book written by Elizabeth Cady Staton. Stanton was actually raised conservative Presbyterian. She was a well educated woman who graduated from seminary in the 1800's. This book reflects Stanton's views.Stanton was president of the National Woman Suffrage Association for 20 years. She thought the Bible and all organized religion was as instrumental in denying women their rights as the government was. She was friends with Susan B. Anthony and wrote many of Anthony's speeches as Stanton would not travel extensively until her children were grown.This book was not only rejected by Christians in her own time but was also rejected by the women's movement she founded!No doubt, Stanton was an amazing woman in history (google Declaration of Rights of the Women of the United States presented at the centennial celebration in Philadelphia on July 4, 1876-wonderful story!) but I could do without the attacking of one's religion just because it is not your own religion and I could certainly do without people abusing the Amazon rating system.In the very first chapter Stanton attacks the long held view of the Trinity and says it's much more rational for the Trinity to be the heavenly Father, Mother and Son than the Father, Son and holy Spirit and says we should address our prayers to the Heavenly Father and mother.She also says that the word 'Elohim' means 'the gods' when in fact, if you study Hebrew, you will find that it is used with singular verb forms it is used to refer to the God of Israel but allows for plural usage when referring to the Godhead of the Trinity.And a quote from the book ""Psychologist tell us of a sixth sense now in process of development, by which we can read each others minds and communicate without speech.""",0,0,0,0

R1YHI4MRBVSJPN,"This book is seriously flawed.  The author ignores some very important details:-The role of the political officers in the hierarchy of the Viet Cong and the NVA. These cadre often possessed little or nothing in the way of military experience, yet were often heavily involved in the planning and execution of military operations.  A reasonable observer could conclude that the very high casualty rates and the low morale experienced by the Viet Cong may well have been caused by political expediency.  It is also worth noting that many of the glowing reports of Viet Cong “military victories” were not written by commanders, but by the unit political officers.-The so called “proselytizing” by the Viet Cong on Vietnamese civilians in local hamlets and villages was much more pervasive than the author would lead you to believe.  Villagers were “taxed” for food and labor, often at gunpoint.  Long harangues on political theory kept hard working rice farmers up until all hours of the night.  Many political officers were also butchers and sadists, and tortured government hamlet chiefs and their families.  Atrocities committed by these men are often overlooked by historians, and this author is no exception.-The author mentions in passing “supplies” and “logistics”.  He does not elaborate on the sources for these supplies, which would include food, ammunition and weapons.  Was the food taken from local villagers or supplied by North Vietnam?  Did the supplies come down the Ho Chi Minh trail or through the port of Sihanoukville in Camodia?-The author fails to go into detail concerning the intelligence gathering capabilities supporting the Viet Cong.  The combination of the Trung Sat, the GRU, and the KGB enabled the North Vietnamese to “read the mail” of virtually every military and political organization in South Vietnam.  While the folks that served in MACV would dispute this, we can see from the raid at Son Tay that perhaps security was not what it could be for the US Army.The book is also full of “This unit went here and did this and that unit went there and did that”, which tends to make for slow reading and does nothing to make a difficult to understand war any clearer.  US Army combined arms doctrine is described in detail, which helps the reader understand how we were able to win so many battles with the Viet Cong.Too bad we lost the war.",0,0,0,0

R3LOHSXSH3FT4L,"I gave this book one star only because Amazon doesn't allow the option to select zero stars.My husband and I have read and enjoyed many of Bill Bryson's books. In the past, we considered him one of our favorite writers. After reading this book, it will be a long time before I open another of his works.Mr Bryson's petty criticisms of the small towns through which he drove and his obvious contempt for all things Southern will leave any American who loves her country feeling a deep disdain for all things Bryson. While reading this book, there were many times my husband and I would look at one another and ask, ""What could have happened to him to make a man from the Midwest develop such a negative view of all things American?"" and ""Do you think this book was REALLY written by 'our' Bill Bryson?"" (BTW, we no longer consider him 'our' Bill Bryson.)I mentioned that Mr Bryson 'drove through' small towns in America because that's exactly what he describes in the book. After a quick, judgmental glimpse of a town, he bypasses it altogether as totally unworthy of his time, money, or attention.Bryson didn't bother to visit many of the historical attractions along the way. Apparently, he was on a very tight budget. He DID, after all, borrow his mother's old Chevette for the journey. The cost of admission to these sites require him to cut back on his beloved beer and chicken-fried steak.Last, but definitely not least, Mr Bryson showed himself to be a bigot. His contempt for 'all things white and all things Southern' along with his propensity for revisiting every bit of negative racial history every recorded during his BRIEF drive through the deep South demonstrated just how out of touch he is with the country of his birth and his, obvious, disdain for truth. He chose to ignore any progress made in race relations during the past 40 years. He chose to see, and share, his view that America is, and will always be, the country he would most like to see in 'his rearview mirror'. I, for one, welcome him to return to his country of choice and not bother to darken the doors of the home I love. The last thing the United States of American needs is one more person to describe our country in such negative terms.",0,0,0,0
R10F282Y8MJM5U,"What in the world is this?!?! What the hell were they thinking???? It has been a very very long time since I felt I was being tortured in a movie theater due to I had to sit through a whole excuse of a movie (thanks to my companion) and bear such pain. I was literally screaming inside my head wanting to get out, but oh no, it was useless. Instead I had put up with one of the worse movies I have seen recently in the cinema.The movie is set in the future and how video games will be developed. That is not a bad idea considering that video games are ruling the world for some quite time now, but how the director developed the movie was simply ridiculous. Real life inmates are the characters you are playing and it is up to you for that convicted criminal to get out of each battle scenario alive. Yes, this film does contain action sequences but nothing that you haven't seen before.  Gerald Butler is not a bad actor, but this could have easily killed his Hollywood career.  Michael C. Hall gave in my opinion one of the shoddiest performances in 2009. At one point during the film you will not believe your eyes when you see convicts (Yes, that's right... convicts!) dancing to a Frank Sinatra tune. At that state I didn't know the perspective of the director and his intentions if it were to make us laugh or try to be psychedelic one way or the other. To me, it was just another reason to affirm how bad this movie is.Reading the few 5 star reviews of this film makes me wonder if we saw the same movie, but in the end for some reason they are the minorities (No offense). Once I left the theater I ran to the nearest pub and drowned myself in liquor thinking how I was never going to get those 2 hours of my life back.  The thought still haunts me `til this day.",0,0,1,1

It may STICK the same way but it is by far a WAY cheaper material. It's like a cheap black trash bag. You have to be exceedingly careful when separating the ""perforated"" sheets because it tears EXTREMELY easily. A previous post was also correct about it letting light in at the edges. I tried to take a previous reviewers advice and cut a little extra to compensate...but it wont stick fully to the window unless all edges are ON the actual window...so you HAVE to cut it a little short. I cleaned my windows very thoroughly and cut all my pieces ahead of time. Since I cut just a little extra I had to remove the piece from the window and cut off the extra since it wouldn't work unless the whole piece was on the window. BIG mistake. This crap will absolutely NOT stick more than one time. I have no idea how people use this more than once. It's on the windows for now (thank goodness for ten sheets) but there's light peeking in everywhere.

R31GTVNFEER6L5,"I liken this book to a boy band group. Some smug hair gelled agent realizes that all he has to do is pluck some young teenager from obscurity, give him a huge marketing push and sell him as every other teen wanabee's dream in order to wrap the foil of the publishing world around a turkey of a book. In spite of the writing being as captivating as crumpled gift wrapping the storm of advertising guarantees that the fans will eat it up. The adherence to contemporary metaphor, story rhythm, character drama, and daring uses of the protagonist/antagonist duality are all tossed for a cheap laser printed fairy tale. The masses of young people who buy this book are simply doing it to revel in the young writer's rags to riches story. A few press releases later and you find hordes of desperate teenagers attempting to identify the star's apparent overnight success with their own potential. This is why many of the novice consumers will shout to high heaven with fingers in their ears when someone with more sophisticated, and more deserving, tastes attempts to reveal this book as the lightweight material it really is. This book represents the worst of cheap, instantaneous, lazy fame. The ""maybe it can happen to me"" effect gets pumped to full volume so that hero-oriented teenagers can hope that someday their own understanding of the world formulated from sci-fi movies of the week will be seen and appreciated by everyone.Often the songs/screenplays/novels are atrocious mock-ups of well cultured three-dimensional classics that everyone in the world was inspired by. What flies over the head of most young artists is that what is considered inspirational is often brought about from the chaos of the evolving world. Socio-economic changes, shifts in national personality, new sciences, heck even hitting puberty all serves as potent inspiration for well cultured ideas portrayed through songs, film, paintings and of course books. Merely echoing a genius work only spotlights how little the shadower understands of the art. Much like how a math student can scribble the professor's workings on the chalk board and even calculate them, but not know how to create the formulas themselves. Like the bumbling math student, young writers/songwriters/actors often surf into a tunnel vision of perfection that leads not only to bad, predictable writing, but also to featherweight computer snap-pop, armor piercing rap music, limp wristed goth battle movies and cliques of fashion dojos. Teens need a standard of perfection and they look for it beyond their parents, namely in the glamor of a copy ad. The underlying mentality is ""If you're good enough for tv, you're good enough for me!"" The understanding with most children is that whatever worthwhile, and thus beautiful, is filmed. If they can be associated with what is beautiful, strong, courageous... perfect then they will be entitled to the riches of the world. Like all the clothing pinnups, teen be-bop songs and grainy online video contests this novel is just another ego enticement for the young. Like its cousins the novel is about as memorable as a phone jingle from a blackberry.I've alway's been irked by the old mantra that reading a book makes you smarter. Junk books exist as much as junk media, it's just that you can absorb and critique a movie much faster than a book. This is why movies take more flak for being horrible in general. People can see several movies much faster than they could read several books. No one has time to read a bad book... unless you are young enough get ensnared by the jungle trap of the marketing hunter.",0,0,0,0

RE0PE9FDSMFIZ,"BLOW FLYA really awful bookWe got this book on tape on sale at Sam's Club to keep us awake on a 14 hour drive.  To see what the book was about, we read the first page of a paper copy. It sounded a lot like the TV program CSI. This is an alert that book is not like CSI and deserves an R rating for language, violence, and sexual content.My main problem with the book is that it is too gross, wordy, and slow-moving. There are too many banal similes and too much boring detail. There is also too much extended, graphic descriptions of sex and violence. After six hours of it I was attempting to fast forward through the second digression into the thoughts of one of the psychopathic killers. The first time we were dragged through what he intended to do to his next victim. That was more than enough to convince me that he was crazy and awful. I didn't need the later diversion into his memories of victims past and what he did to them.I wanted to like the main character, but she did not appear often and was rather pitiful due to losing her job as the result of making a bad mistake at the end of the previous book. I wanted to like at least two other characters, but they turned out to be people who often behaved in ways that were not to like.We finally gave up on the book. Since the author had by then set up two characters with plans that were converging to impact the main character, I wondered how the story ended. Surely it had to end badly for many of the characters, since they were mostly behaving badly. I thought I could find out how the plot worked out by looking in a printed copy in a book store. However, what would normally be a rather large display of the book was sold out. I could not understand how such an awful book could be selling so well, so I read the reviews on Amazon. I found that many fans of the author's previous books in the series bought the book but hated it. Most telling was that they also hated the ending. One reviewer described throwing the book across the room out of disgust with the ending. At that point I did not care about the ending any more.",0,0,0,0

RFL3YV3HSVKEP,"The first 296? Ehhh, not so much.My apologies to BORAT, but I found Rawi Hage's COCKROACH a difficult read, at best. I felt that the least I could do though, was to start out with one nice -and honest- compliment.Since a basic description of what the book is about can be found in the ""Editorial Reviews"" (located above the product details), I see no point in offering yet another synopsis.Besides, the problem I had with the book does not involve the story, it has to do with Hage's writing style. I'll provide a couple of examples (and who knows... perhaps you'll find them intriguing.)In the first snippet (from page 54), the main character (the ""Cockroach,"" whose name is never actually revealed) is looking for his ""friend,"" Reza:>>>A week later, I found Reza at last. He was walking down the street, sniffing left and right for a filling tune or an inspiring meal. I ran towards him and grabbed his hand and pulled on one of his fingers, and before he had a chance to pull it away I said, I am hungry as well, you drooling beast. And one day I will snap your finger and let you pluck those strings with your yellow teeth.Reza shouted at this, warning me never to touch his fingers again. He lifted them up against the cold and stuck his thumb towards the sky and pointed and shouted at me, If you touch them again, I will take you back to your goat dunes!<<<Creative, I suppose, but not my cup of tea as a writing style.Occasionally, Hage seems to go off on a tangent, as on page 75, when the main character is about to flick a piece of dust from his fingers:>>>I let it fret against gusts of wind and then released it, watching it leave confused, pain-struck and disoriented in the whistling air, which sounded like mournful trains and sirens of war howling at the sight of fighter planes that descend and ascend and tumble in the air and land and freeze on the ground like insects with metal wings, like a child's toy in the bath brought back to the surface by the small hands of an invisible hero or tossed out and hidden under a wooden dresser until they are forgotten and invaded by dustballs, deserted in favour of the call for food and the threats of giant mothers.<<<Holy cow! Can you say ""free association gone wild?""My last example comes from page 147 when the Cockroach is navigating a slippery path:>>>Walking over the bumps of glassy ice, I extended my arms like an airplane passing above a circus juggler walking a rope in ballerina shoes while below him elephants worked for peanuts and monkeys clapped.<<<I'll give Mr. Hage this: He is a master at weaving compound, multi-level, 12-step, can't-see-where-you're-going similes. Somewhere between ""her eyes were like limpid pools"" and the incredible sentences in COCKROACH, there probably lies a happy medium.Fortunately though, there IS an actual story being told, and Hage seems to lighten up on the similies-from-hell in the last half of his book. If you can get through the writing in the first half (and you should know from reading this review as to whether or not it's even something you would like), the pace really picks up and I found myself --much to my surprise-- sort of enjoying it.'Til the last 9 pages.

ROZE7R6NBYXN,"UPDATE:I finally gave up on this chair mat. Even with a professional heat gun, heating it up then weighing it down on the floor, it returns to a rolled position if taken off the floor and curls at the edges when on the floor after it cools. I don't know how they managed to convince this mat that its natural state is ""curled up in a useless roll"" but that's how it is. I ended up filing for a return/refund on Amazon. DO NOT recommend buying this item.ORIGINAL REVIEW:Don't make the mistake I did and think that you don't need to check reviews for something as simple as a chair mat. Apparently, it's completely possible for a company to mess up such a basic product! It has a bit of a smell, though that seemed to go away after laying it out in the sun for a few hours, but that's not the real problem.It came so tightly rolled that it required the help of another person just to unbox the thing and ATTEMPT to lay it flat. But it will not lay flat, no matter what I do. Heat? Nope. Pressure? As soon as that's removed, it rolls back up again. It also isn't particularly secure on the carpeting, because the little pegs on the bottom are short and rounded - they don't GRIP the carpeting.Right now, I'm holding it down with some heavy items on all the edges, hoping to train this thing to stop rolling, but I highly doubt that'll work. If it doesn't, I might have to return this failure of a mat. Otherwise, I might relegate it to the hard floor in the workshop. It isn't useful for carpet, which I bought it for.

R3VLRZVXDBOKZF,"If you are a Seventh-day Adventist or sect. thereof you will most likely like and believe what is on this DVD. It was so unreal to me I did a lot of searching before rating the DVD. What I found was  FRAUD. It is one thing to watch the movie part of the story, but when Ron Wyatt starts speaking, telling his story you will understand why I call this a fraud that is if you have any knowledge of Scripture. His own claims especially of the future as told by Scripture are untrue.  The sad thing is the man claims to speak from the Bible yet at the same time refutes a large part of Scripture. I should have researched Ron Wyatt before ordering this DVD. That would be the best thing you can do if you are interested in the DVD. Don't take my word for it do the research and what you find will amaze you. It is one big FRAUD and a lot of DECEPTION and statements that have NO credibility. The only person that can back up what Ron Wyatt gives out is Ron Wyatt and he is dead. He has followers most of which come from the Seventh-day Adventist sect. or poor souls who are unwilling to do their own research. Ron Wyatt goes aganist God's word. You don't touch the Ark of the Covenant, yet he did or so he says he did. For a mortal man to touch the Ark of the Covenant without being struck dead is Bible. By Scripture no man is allowed to touch it. Wyatt does not use all Scripture only the Scripture which supports his beliefs and even then he give his version only, not the full Scripture. He truly makes a mess of the book of Revelation. Within the past three years Netanyahu leader of Israel made the statement that if the government of Israel or any of its researchers had any knowlege of the known place of the Ark of the Covenant it would be known and used by Israel. He stated they or no one other than God knows where the Ark of the Covenant is located. The blood evidence is no where to be found. The so called resting place of Noah's Ark has been proven false. The deceptions just goes on and on, there is so much deception. Wyatt makes so many statements that are just self serving.

R3MSP4MYAJZLTA,"My review here is quite belated, but I hope to bring out certain points pertinent to Dr Schoch's competence outside the field of Geology, as well as the fallacies in some of his arguments. The book is mis-titled. There is nothing but cursory descriptions of ancient voyages, much less who the builders of the pyramids actually were wherever they are found. There is no new information on this theme here. Nearly all the information is based on traditional thinking, rather than cutting edge developments. Dr Schoch needs to read a lot more and stay abreast of contemporary research. Much of what he writes about in his books is the same old tripe he was indoctrinated with during his baccalaureate. Despite this, he asserts that the evidence coming forward changes the traditional linear view of civilization's development. In the first chapter he tells the reader civilization is much older than estimated by scholars, but makes the immediate gaffe of stating civilization spread from Sumer to Egypt. In fact, what is known is that Sumer was an offshoot of an older civilization (dispute between Egyptian and Indian), and at the fall of Sumer there was a reciprocal cultural influence by Sumer upon Egypt, for the two were never completely out of touch with each other. The one thing you won't find in any of his books is scientific data that he has acquired through original research. He is not doing what a reputable scientist like Thomas Brophy did, lay out his investigations, present the data, and propose an hypothesis. Rather, in his books he uses his title as PhD to authenticate his speculations.Dr. Schoch has a striking tendency to contradict himself. In the introduction he announces that the pyramids of Egypt and elsewhere are older than originally presumed, but in the first chapter details the traditional dates. He uses the Atlas of Ancient Egypt for his source material, published in 1980. In the second chapter he introduces the modest changes in his dating. But here it is nothing but his trained opinion against the established thinking. There is no conclusive testing and resultant data.In his retelling of the Howard-Vyse inscription dilemma, he declares the source for the fraudulence of the inscription derives from Sitchin, yet he presents no evidence of his own to substantiate his assertion that the inscription associates Khufu with building the pyramid. Although the inscription in ochre paint could be carbon dated, it is well known that carbon 14 decay is heavily influenced by solar and galactic radioactive sources. The assumption behind C14 dating is the notion that decay rates are constant, which was known to be a conceptual error at the time of Schoch's printing this book. This has an impact on the conflicting dates found in the pyramid mortar and underscores the scientific regression from C14 dating as a reliable method.Dr. Schoch introduces the subject of the calendar circle at Nabta Playa, Egypt. Here he assigns dates to the area from 7,000 BC of nomadic settling, to 5,500 BC with a complex social system. It so happens that Dr. Schoch wrote the forward to Thomas Brophy's The Origin Map, published a full two years before this book. (He was in possession of Brophy's manuscript by Nov 2001.) Reviewing his comments there reveals that he knew full well the details of the calendar circle and other structures in the area, as well as Brophy's dating of the circle to not only 4,940 BC, but 6,400 BC and as early as 16,500 BC. Brophy assigns a construction date of the circle at 6,800 BC. Schoch's errors ranging from 25-50% (using Brophy's dating as the baseline) does not reflect the respectability attributed to this geologist. This seriously undermines Dr. Schoch's dating cited in his Voyages book and is suggestive of an attempt to bend the facts to lend greater weight to his own date estimations. Such equivocation has prompted my wife to redefine PhD in Dr. Schoch's case to mean Poor History Duff.Trust a geologist to say that the ""point of a pyramid is its mass"" instead of its point. The mass of a pyramid is not what matters, it's the dimensions that encode important relationships to be preserved to posterity. The Scandinavians call them Minehallens, or memorial halls. In the second chapter he mentions the pyramids are monuments and memorials to dead kings, but misses the central idea that they were considered portals for the king's soul in the afterlife (only later does he hint at this as an after-thought). If a pyramid is a representation of the axis mundi, and is constructed to align with certain stars, reflecting in its dimensions the very relationship of the earth with the rest of the universe, it then symbolizes the passageway for the soul to not only return home, but achieve immortality, as detailed in the Egyptian Book of the Dead. In this context, they were not built as monuments to honor the dead king, but facilitate his ascension in the afterlife. How can a PhD miss so elementary a principle? He rambles on about concepts of which he has no grasp.In his 2001 preface to The Origin Map he exudes confidence in Brophy's work on the pyramid alignments, citing the work of Bauval. Then two years later denigrates Bauval's work for being overly ""precise"" and ""exact in their correlations"" considering the weathering of the pyramids, when Brophy's plots are even more exacting than Bauval's! This highlights the difference between a good engineer (Bauval) and a theoretical scientist (Schoch). Take a look at typical coursework differences between a Geologist and an Engineer. You will find far more courses required for the engineer in Calculus, Physics, and Chemistry, depending on discipline than for a Geologist. In my undergraduate program I was required to complete six semesters of Calculus, because methods of solutions to a broad range of problems in physics is essential to engineering competence. A good engineer can measure a site and determine to the precision of his instruments where the corner of a monument was intended to be. Knowing the ideal shape of the structure he can reconstruct the original design plot by the ancient planners. This is a similar problem with facial recognition/restoration programs developed for photographic application. A statistical accuracy of 99% is defined as ""highly significant"", 90% as ""significant"" in science and this is precisely the accuracy obtained by Bauval. Compared to Brophy's analysis, Bauval attained 90% accuracy with a first order approximation. Yet Schoch wants to criticize Bauval's work, which was sustained by the physicist whom he lauds, and Schoch apparently lacks the mathematical skill necessary to expatiate the issue.Get this one: ""When the recently arrived Pilgrims were clueless as to how to grow crops in the strange, new land of what is now Massachussetts, the local Indians showed them the way, saving the whites from starvation.""(p78) How can a PhD be so ignorant and imprecise with regard to early colonial American history? Easy. A Geologist is not required to know anything significant about American history. Does he honestly believe the Pilgrims didn't know anything about raising crops in a climate comparable to their homeland? There is more to the story of imminent Pilgrim starvation than the nuances of raising corn or squash in central New England. If the reader cannot be served the accuracy and precision the author demands of others, how can anything he writes be accepted with confidence?One of the chief difficulties in describing the past scholars and scientists have is refraining from describing what happened, and inventing causal relationships, as if they had lived then. The amount of evidence they have to support their assertions is scant, and they really are doing the public a disservice when they speculate under the guise of scholarly authority as though their opinions were fact. Another problem is the tendency to interpret the past anachronistically. The reader will find such gaffes scattered throughout Dr. Schoch's writings.In chapter four Dr Schoch attempts to introduce the problems between amateurs and experts, and scientific specialists who know little about each other's ""research."" Right here one should find a twinge of conscience by Dr Schoch, for as a geologist he is faring into historical, anthropological, and cultural areas knowing his ignorance is plainly manifest to anyone staying abreast of developments. This is an inferred admission that his expertise is compartmentalized. In this chapter he introduces the problems of Zecharia Sitchin and Erich von Daniken, as if these writers could lend elevation by contrast to his own vaunted knowledge! They should not even be mentioned in a serious presentation on diffusionism. If he really wanted to contrast his ""research"", he should be using the findings of his peers, not the opinions of popular press ""investigators."" This is just plain shoddy scholarship.By page 100 out of 304 I'm seeing such a strong trend I find it is pointless to finish the book. The interested reader should take a word to the wise here, and look elsewhere if they are seriously interested in learning more about the ancient past. Dr Schoch has joined the popular scientific fringe crowd and presents no serious research and analysis worthy of his accolades.",0,0,0,0

R2FWJZXREIIXDM,"I used these with an Epson WF-7620 printer.Thus far, I am very happy with these ink cartridges. They are certainly not as rich as the Epson cartridges, and I would not use them for work where print quality is of great importance, but I am happy with them to use for general printing and scratch-work. The cost saving is tremendous. The only issue I had stemmed from attempting to use a ""fine"" quality ink setting when printing. This resulted in my printer nozzles becoming clogged. Since the printer can clean the nozzles, it merely resulted in wasted ink, but be warned.Update: I have gone through 2 of these cartridges now and my opinion still stands. These are great for scratch-work, but I have noticed they do not handle very fine lines very well. No number of print-head alignments fixes this, so I can come out with some hazy images (in my case, music staff lines). This isn't a big deal for what I do with them, but it's good to know. I have also noticed that my printer gives me false low-ink readings, however. Keep that in mind if you purchase them.Update 2: The 2nd time purchased a set of 2 of these cartridges, I was sent cartridges of a different brand, E-Z Ink. I'm not sure who owns that brand, but a customer representative told me that, when they do not have the LD branded ones in stock, they will send out others. They did vouch for the quality of the cartridges and there is still a ""lifetime warranty,"" but this is unnerving because it was not wanted I ordered. I will have to see if the E-Z Ink carts work as well as the LD ones, but it renders reviews for this product somewhat useless if a customer cannot be assured to get what they have researched via reviews.

R44VFW7HYTXSK,"I truly wanted to enjoy this book.  But as mentioned before, the hype that went with it made have actually hurt it, since fantasy readers and 'experienced' readers will expect so much more from such a 'young prodigy'.  truth is that the book is not bad, it is a nice and quick read for fantasy fans, but it will be that for younger readers and readers that are just getting into the fantasy books.  If you have read Tolkien and Pullman and so many others you will be dissapointed by the book, cause it ends up being a D&D story, and any HS in the world has a good teen writer that can come up with a book like this.  The plot clearly is the product of an inexperienced writer who read Tolkien (old wise man, Elven princess with a thing for the human, a hidden city in the mountains)and saw Star Wars (rebel 'princess' with a thing for the rouge hero, hero finds missing sibbling - this last bit was not part of book 1 but you can see it comming a mile away)and formulated a very simply and predictable story (there was not one single plot twist that surprises or that doesn't have a direct relation with SW and LOTR, except for the telepathic dragon and I've been told that is also an idea from other fantasy series).the kid has potential, but the marketing has over hyped the quality of the book, which would hurt any developing writer. It doesn't help that the author over-hyped himself as well; on his site he claims to strive ""for a lyrical beauty somewhere between Tolkien at his best and Seamus Heaney's translation of Beowulf"".  Now that is a mouthful not easily lived up to.  And from his use of language and prose, his editor should let him know he is years and years away from that.Since he is maturing, hopefully the 2nd book will reflect that, but from the reviews so far, this may not be the case.

R3U56JOXFZOXPB,"I rarely write reviews, but this unit does not do what it says it does, and I'd like to save another potential buyer from going through what I did. If all you want to do is scan and organize papers, I think that this unit would be FABULOUS once you get it installed and start using it (this is not a quick or easy task). However, IF YOUR GOAL IS TO EXPORT, I would not buy this unit. Since that is my purpose, I'm returning it.I bought this with the intent of scanning charge receipts from my business and exporting them into Quickbooks. The box and information say that Neat will do this. I hate this task, and I thought the money would be well worth the time savings.Installation: The box comes with version 4 of the software. However, version 5 is out, so you are directed to the internet to obtain it as prior problems have supposedly been fixed. Their website is slow, freezes, and often links you to a non-functioning page. After multiple tries, I was able to download the software. It directs you to disable any internet firewalls or anti-virus software. Seems easy, but Firefox didn't have a pull down menu for this. Had to go to help and finally found out how to do this. (The time required for this was my ignorance and not Neat's, however, the same might be true of others as well).Usual policy to close all other programs during installation of a new program was followed. Finally ready to install, and it freezes and crashes my computer (Windows XP) and my wireless mouse multiple times. I had to endure many restarts of my computer (most had to be without proper shutdown and by using the on/off switch on my computer), and unplugging and plugging the USB connection to the computer for the wireless mouse. Three hours later, it finally installed.Starting: I'm pretty intuitive and usually start using a program and exploring menus without a problem. However, menus are not intuitive until you read the directions. Again, this is more time invested. Once reading the directions, I have to admit it was no problem using the machine, but it was cumbersome. The first thing is that although the scanning is pretty quick, it takes a while for the software to convert the data into a viewable receipt. Perhaps the best thing is to scan in a bunch of receipts, then go do something else while it works and come back later. I wanted to see if it exported properly before I invested a lot of time scanning. If you do have to go away and do something else while it is processing the scans, it takes away from the time saving purpose of using Neat.The next problem is each time you export a receipt, you have to drill down to tell Neat where you want it to export. This involves many clicks from My Computer, All users, shared documents, documents and settings, shared documents, Quickbooks, Company, etc. You can't set any or preferable locations. Then, you have to choose the account from Neat software to the account in QB's each time. Takes a lot of time. Batching the exports is definitely the way to go to make things efficient, but still not as much of a time saver as I thought it would be, especially when you have to keep selecting the accounts in QB's.Practical use: This is where the Neat fails miserably. I have an account in Quickbooks where all the charge receipts go. They are listed with the vendor, date purchased, and the account that they go into e.g. office supplies, hardware, software, etc. When Neat exports them, it exports them as bills to pay so are under accounts payable and not in the Charge Register under the account that I selected. To get that information, you have to then go to accounts payable. Therefore it is an extra step to go to accounts payable to see the detail to make sure it was correct as well as to look at it for analysis on another occasion. Although that's not the way I record I QB's, I could live with that if it meant that I didn't have to enter all those receipts.  Another problem was that it wouldn't export credit card refunds.  It said it would not import because the amount was under $10!!  It seems absurd not to be able to export credits.  I didn't try to import and charges under $10 so I don't know what it would do there.However, the final thing that killed the deal was that the exported items all come in with the date exported, and not the date of purchase. I tried several different things, checked online forums, help, but there wasn't anything about correcting this. There is no live help; help and customer service are only available by email. I got an email back that says they will get to me when they can. Given that, I went through all the menus, help info, and user forums. My conclusion was that there appears to be no fix for that. If I have to go into each receipt to fix the date, I might as well just enter them.Conclusion: The problems using this to export to Quickbooks make is such that it just doesn't do the job. There are multiple steps to define the program to export to each time, define the account to go to each time, then go to accounts payable to view the details of the export, and then to change the date on the transaction. In addition you have to enter any refunds or credits manually and not through Neat as it won't export them.  This kills the whole idea to create efficiency and save time.",0,0,0,0

The database software is easy to use and provides a backup functionality that every user should take advantage of on a regular basis.

One of my scanners has a fault. Each and every time I have reached out to them, I get back the same link to the same web page telling me how to clean the scanner. Even if I mention in the ticket that I ALREADY cleaned the scanner. The warranty for the scanner is not worth the paper it is written on (or the electrons you scanned it into). And many of the so-called ""service plans"" you get from vendors like Staples insist that you exercise the manufacturer warranty first.I like the product.

RCSD22HPE4ES7,"Do not buy this printer.  I've never taken the time to write a review before, but decided to do it in this case because of how shoddy this product is.

R18B20R8AG5YS7,"The plot of this book is the classic coming-of-age story (with dragons, albeit) that one sees in works such as Harry Potter and Star Wars. You can basically cross out the character names from synopses of those and replace them with the character names from Eragon. The story line is classic, but this book doesn't even bring any interesting twists to it.The characters are archetypes, with no personality quirks that would have made them actually interesting.If the author was given an assignment to write a book based on this classic story type, this would have been an admirable response.

R3HE8Z1FQHWHLK,"After reading numerous reviews and seeing this book come up in so many lists of great historical fiction I picked it up as a Christmas present to myself.  At the time I was reading Here Be Dragons by Sharon Kay Penman, which is easily one of the best books I have ever read.  I was very excited to dive into this book, but I must say that it fell flat in every way for me and was a huge disappointment.I believe the most important elements of a book is the bond which is developed between the reader and the characters.  I want to feel happy, sad, cringe when bad decisions are made, and cry when tragedy lurks. This book created none of this for me.  I can honestly say that I didn't care for any of the characters in this book and actually found them a little irritating.  I don't even know why some of them, Jane in particular, were even in the story.  Most of the secondary characters added nothing and only lengthened an already dull plot.  The love story the book is based on was not rich enough to fill close to 700 pages and lacked passion.  I didn't like Barbara or Roger, found Diana to be irritating and the Duchess predictable.Another disappointment is the ending of this book which dragged on far too long only to discover that there is no true ending.There are more books in this series which I will not be picking up.  Although this book is dripping with rich detail I can not bring myself to recommend this as a great historical fiction read.",0,0,0,0

Crash is made up of too many different stories and too many different characters.  That makes it hard to follow and keep up with, even more so since so many of the characters look alike.  I didn't even realize that it was some of the same people in more than one different story till I read some of the other reviews presented here.  I also don't think it's very realistic.

They shot for a dramatic, emotional movie and they ended up with a cheesy, fake, and pointless version of the (mediocre at best) book. A suggestion I have is for the ghost of Chris Farley to play Lacey and then maybe it would be bearable. Overall this is a emotionally taxing movie and I would not recommend it.P.S.There is humor that only sixteen year old boys who have crushes on each others mothers would appreciate.P.P.S.If you want to watch a terrible movie that is entertaining watch magic puppy because it doesn't pretend to be a good movie (and the van doesn't change color).",0,0,0,0

What I think they mean when say that all White people are racist is that all White people are racist, except for White people like them.The White liberals who made this film go even further and seem to be saying that we are all racist, even Black people like me.  But, again, you get the feeling that the movie makers don't think they are racist. They are so smart and perceptive that they are above us all.  If only we could be like them!  I think the people giving this film good reviews are self-righteous White people who think like that.As a Black man living in America, I have had a few minor prejudicial experiences, especially late at night when the street is mostly deserted and I pass people of other races and they seem nervous.

I don't like making a big deal about it and nor should White liberals who don't know as much about other races as they think they do.Another thing about this picture is that while the makers think they are unpolluted by racism enough to be like referees over the rest of us, they sure use a lot of racial stereotypes in the characters.",0,0,0,0

R107E20E0X29TA,"One diet does not fit all, evidently.I gave this a whirl after a friend of mine lost 10 lbs in one month, and she had admittedly cheated a bit with some coffee and alcohol along the way, and did not exercise. A lot of the glowing reviews I read went on about how they were able to cheat or skimp on the exercise and still lost 10 lbs. Since I knew I was in for a really busy month with work and would not have time to properly exercise, I thought that 10 lbs was a very generous weight loss and thought I would go through it as well.Week one started out strong, wherein I lost 2 lbs. Not bad! Week 2 however, I gained a pound back, and then lost it, so still at 2 lbs. Week 3 brought off another pound and week 4, yet another. My loss was only 4 lbs and I had lost as much in the previous month on my own diet (which allowed me sugar, caffeine and wheat). I found that I tended to lose weight during Phase 2 (suspiciously during the low calorie phases... hmm!) and that my gain was during the 3-day healthy fat phase. I know Pomroy insists that this is not a calorie-based diet, but it makes me wonder.I also know that this diet is not just about the weight loss and that I am purging my body of toxins, etc. People reported feeling their best ever, boundless energy, depression cured... yeah, not so much. I didn't feel worse, but I didn't feel better either. I am very disappointed that such a labor intensive diet (you will be a slave in the kitchen, even if you use the slow cooker a lot and freeze batches of food), with so many restrictions and rigorous eating schedule brought me the same results as when I was eating in a way in which I enjoyed myself.As it happened, I had a blood panel done 3 weeks before starting the diet, and my thyroid was deemed in good working order, so I can't pass blame on that. The only differenceI can think of between my friend's results and mine was that I am on progesterone therapy, which has a side effect of weight gain. Except for a flub where I was eating sprouted grain bread in phase 3 that contained corn meal (and I can't fathom that a small amount  of corn in this diet could derail me by a full 6 lbs - I ate less than half the loaf in the whole month!), I was religious about not crossing foods over from different phases and did not cheat.While I could give it another go for a month and add proper exercise to the mix, now that I have some time to put in at the gym, I don't think it's worth it. According to so many people, it's possible to lose 10 lbs without exercising on this plan, and since my previous diet netted me about the same 4 lb weight loss as the FMD did, I just assume go back to how I was eating before, while hitting the gym. I did pick up some new recipes from this diet that I will carry over into my normal diet, but now I look forward to enjoying my coffee with milk, the occasional chunk of dark chocolate and such. When I explained to my doctor how I was eating before, she said it was pretty much a Mediterranean diet anyway with lean meats and veggies, healthy oils and dairy in moderation. At least now I am not bound to a rigorous eating schedule and constantly cooking.",0,0,0,0

There are moments of greatness within the pages, and as for the simple act of creating a story, placing characters and orchestrating a chain of events, the guy wasn't bad.Unfortunately his pretentious writing style bleeds through on nearly every single page, so absurdly that it disrupts from the actual story.  I loved the characters, I was intrigued by the plot, but halfway through I realized that I was FORCING myself to continue reading because the poor old bastard kept getting so far gone on his cheesy tangents of love, and of the minor backstories of characters found only within the backstories of supporting characters (Pilar's matador's tale that consumed four or five pages) that the story suffered greatly.Hemingway fancied himself a wordsmith I suppose, and therefore managed to crowbar the word ""now"" about fifty times into a single paragraph, often repeating the word up to four times in a row, and the truly funny part is that people regard him as a genius for it.So after experiencing Hemingway I can honestly say that I won't be going back, and I can only envy his success.",0,0,0,0

R21MQG4JVM6KPC,"After a horrible experience with a brand new HP Officeject Pro 8500, and a less than helpful customer service rep, I boxed the HP and returned it to the store.  I spent a couple of days researching other options for my home office.  I was really looking for a wireless printing option that is customizable through ""apps"" that can be downloaded to the printer.  I ran across The Lexmark Pinnacle Pro 901 at a brick-and-mortar store.  I read some really good online reviews of it and decided to give it a try and ordered it through Amazon at about $50 off the brick-and-mortar store.Compared to the HP, this printer is a JOY to use.  Set up was easy as pie and it works exactly as advertised.  I was up and running with my printer connected to my wireless network within about 20 minutes.The ""apps"" (which Lexmark calls SmartSolutions) have a ways to go.  They are mostly just smart buttons which are programmable to perform repetitive tasks (for example, scanning a document and emailing it).  I am hopeful that more companies will create apps for Lexmark which allow printing of boarding passes, maps, directions, restaurant menus, etc. directly from the printer.For now, I am so happy with this all-in-one printer.  It has de-cluttered my home office (I previously had a printer, scanner, and fax machine scattered about).UPDATE: I previously gave this printer 4-stars, but have changed it to 1 star after a few months of use.  The printer freezes up frequently, requiring a restart to bring it back to life.  Also, I have been through three print heads for this printer.  It will just stop printing black ink.  I clean the print heads following the instructions, then have to call technical support which ultimately results in them shipping me a new print head to install.  This printer is very unreliable!!!",0,0,0,0
RUGAGH2CB145B,"I'm sorry to keep this review very short. I think only serious works deserve long reviews. If Alain wrote this book with his left foot while watching TV, then it's a complete waste of time to sit down and write big paragraphs on Nothing, on bunkum. I read his article in The Guardian (I think) a couple of months ago, and it was about the same subject, I remember him saying something similar to that Q&A mentioned here, about museums being the new churches, or something silly like that. The article had a long list of readers' comments mocking the man and his laughable thoughts. It seems like he is going around trying to spread his empty 'thoughts' and only has a very limited dictionary to do so. The article (a faster read) was full of nonsense, which clearly showed that this man Knows NOTHING about Art, Culture or (judging by the book) atheism. I can't believe that someone can buy his ideas. Trying to tell atheists that religion has some good values, morals or things to take inspiration from is just insane. And he obviously doesn't even know ABC atheism, or why atheists despise religions. I think he is just trying to make some money out of his poor ideas, or as someone here suggested, he is just here to mock atheists.Sorry but English is not my first language.",0,0,0,0

To give you an idea of my tastes, I enjoy Kim Harrison, Patricia Briggs, Laurell K Hamilton, Kelley Armstrong, Rachel Vincent and Carrie Vaughn. I found the story line weak and lacking direction, not enough adventure and the characters underdeveloped with repetitive dialogue and sexual references. I didn't find it steamy at all, not a patch on laurell k hamilton, unimaginative scenes with an awful lot of anal activity. This book seems to be more about the sex life of the main characters and a lot less about the action/adventure, which suits some but not for me unfortunately.

R2HSTED181H5HV,"DO NOT LISTEN TO THE GREAT REVIEWS!!! This is not a heating pad, more like a ""warming"" pad. The point of a heating pad is to get hot enough to relax your muscles. This does not do it. I just purchased this 10 minutes ago from a big box store, and it is by far the worse pad I have used. Definitely not worth the 30 dollars. It appears that any of the heating pads manufactured today are all the same in their low heat output, as this is my third attempt in the last week to purchase a quality heating pad. My best advice is go to the typical auction site and purchase a vintage one. They are more than likely built better, and heat better. The safety aspect of not getting too hot makes sense, but when it does not get hot enough to do the intended job, then the idea itself is pointless.",0,0,1,1

RE167W334Y928,"The media could not be loaded.                      I've been looking for a good hot pot to make shabu shabu, and many of the physical characteristics of this Aroma product were exactly what I was looking for.  Central bowl for soups, external ring for a shared cooking experience, and a plug-in heating element so it could be used easily at the table.  I give the product high marks for all these needs, but I have big concerns in other areas.  Here are my findings and comments that hopefully will help others decide to purchase or not:1 - It's an induction heater, so just like an induction kettle it is LOUD when heating.  Some have posted comments about huge concerns about ""what is going on???"" but the clicking and popping is no different than any induction water kettle and quite normal.  See the attached video to get a good example of the noise while heating.  Overall, I will say that noise-wise it's like an induction water kettle times 4 as far as loudness... the expansive metal bowl structure and glass top seems to amplify the noise and personally it's way too loud for me.  Hard to even talk over the din.2 - The first time I used the product it smelled like burned rubber or plastic.  We had read other reviews stating this and when we first turned it on we were concerned enough to have a fire extinguisher handy just in case.  I think this may be just some oils or something left over from the manufacturing process because the 2nd and 3rd time I tried testing the product the smell was gone.3 - The lid seems like it will shatter at any moment and does not form a tight seal.  I wish I could show my other video (reviews are limited to 1) with the unit boiling because you see some steam going through the vent hole but most of the steam ejecting around the edges of the glass top in an unpredictable manner.  Easy to get a steam burn when trying to remove the top.  In addition, as the boiling really heats up the glass top you hear loud creaks and cracks as if the glass is breaking.  I think it's thermal expansion around the metal exterior ring, but VERY concerning.  Seems like the top will shatter at any moment as others have reported actually happening.4 - Finally, as the unit comes to a rolling boil it really quiets down as you would expect for an induction heater.  The problem is for many hot pot dishes you want a gentle boil or barely boiling at all.  This is the fundamental flaw of the design unfortunately... it's either ""off"" induction heating or ""on 100%"".  So, if you put it say on ""medium"" in an attempt to get a slow boil, what you get in reality is a quick cycle from ""not really boiling"" to ""full rolling boil"" then off until it's not really boiling, etc.  It's like having a car that only has the ability to coast or put the throttle on at 100% and try to go 30 miles per hour... but it only stops accelerating at 60 mph and then lets you coast back to 29 mph.Of all the issues with this unit, it's #4 that killed it for me and I will be returning.  TLDR; It's incredibly loud most of the time,  smells like the unit is burning up when you first use it (but goes away), sounds like the glass lid will shatter at any moment and doesn't fit well enough to avoid steam burns, and can't hold at a gentle boil.",0,0,0,0

R19RHQABMZYRVH,"At first, these seemed like a huge upgrade - they rolled easier and were quieter and I felt they were much safer on my wood floors.

Tried coloring everything again thinking really making sure I saturated the fabric/fur and then hand washing it in cold water. This time the coloring bled everywhere turning white fur dingy and the black STILL FADED!!! I’m irate!!! This horrible marker completely destroyed this stuffed animal!

The material of this canopy is not as strong and water resistance as the original one which I believe is why it allows the water to pool and the canopy to sag.  It really caused the canopy to look worn and having to constantly ""empty"" the water out was very frustrating after only having the canopy for a week.

R289LNY9EXF2Q6,"I bought this expecting it to be like the multi colour one, that I already have. Nope. The quality seems the same but I'm not sure if I got one with tonnes of flaws or if they are all crap! For the price, this should not be happening. First it arrived with a hole in the product box.. Amazon box was fine. Then i noticed something weird smeared on one side with lots of rust. I scraped and washed most off but there is still alot it where the weld is. Next as i was putting the rollers on the bottom, i noticed the whole pole is completely  bent.. so i had to force the feet in, which wrecked one of the feet. And if that wasnt enough.. as I put the knobs on the drawers, I noticed black flecks inside the plastic of the clear drawer. Very noticeable and is extremely frustrating to look at every day! Oh! And on top of that, one knob is falling apart and sharp.I would not suggest this item to anyone.Maybe if the seller contacts me and replaces the entire thing or refunds me money, maybe then I would change my review.. but right now, if I could give it 0 stars, I would.

R1D61MMRH4V3XL,"Perhaps I bought this book at the wrong time or at least with the wrong impression; while this collection of essays did leave several smirks, there wasn't much in the way of the howlingly funny, gutbusting hilarity, wacky  hi-jinks that people keep reviewing about.While it was interesting to  divide the book in half according to setting/stage of his life, the  material rages back and forth without much in the way of structure to keep  the reader interested. Self-deprecating? You betcha. Motivated? Oh mais  oui. Entertaining? Sure, but what's the purpose?The family portraits he  presents only confuse me. Are we to be sympathetic to David because his  foul-mouthed brother shares a dialouge with his father that he himself  could not have? Are we supposed to feel smug and superior for David because  of this? Why is a sister who wants to constantly disguise herself in the  name of subversive humour be portrayed in a ""Gosh, that nutty sister.  What will she think of next to challenge the boundaries of physical  comedy?"" manner.Too many passages seem to relate a story whereby  David suffers a character assassination from someone he doesn't even know,  yet instead of defending himself, he presents himself as someone who  shouldn't even bother.Why is it that Sedaris damns the local hick  culture yet talks for three pages in disgusting detail about a bowel  movement he finds in a toilet? Sure, the social taboos we hold in place are  then brought to the front to be examined, but by the end, I wish he hadn't  even bothered.Overall the book leaves me not with a better  understanding of the author, but rather a feeling like not wanting to spend  too much time trapped in a crowded subway train with him. I know this  sounds like a huge personal criticism of Sedaris, yet its not intended to  be. Rather the book just confuses more than it entertains. I can relate to  feeling disjointed in school but otherwise there are just too many loose  ends in the book for my taste.Perhaps I need to read more of his work  to get a better grounding of his style and mannerisms, but for the most  part, I'm more content to think about my own farcical attempts at the  French language than hear about his.",0,0,0,0

R1GYZKL33FC0SU,"Tl;dr: if you value your hands and sanity, do not purchase this table.I've been working from home for almost a year now and was looking for a table like this. So found one that seemed to suit my needs, read some reviews and ordered it.Package arrived and I immediately began assembling it.All items needed to assemble the product were in number coded packets and the instructions were super straight forward.Started the assembly process and lo and behold! One of the screws that is supposed to connect the height adjustment bar to the bar that supports the table is too short and doesnt fit through the holes all the way. After 30 minutes of thinking I'm doing something wrong, I realize no, it's the screw! Yes, I can go to the hardware store and purchase another, longer screw. Yes, I can return the entire thing. Yes, I can contact the seller. None of those options seemed worth the hassle so out came the clamps to force shut the gap between the metal brackets that the screw must pass through. Great! That's done!Let's move onto assembling the rest! Time to put the wheels on! Get the base ready and go to screw in the wheels. 2 went in without any resistance...the other two? I think I gave myself carpal tunnel syndrome. So half way in and I remember that the package included a mini wrench! Grab the wrench and....the wrench is literally a quarter of a centimeter in thickness. The nut is also only a quarter of an centimeter in thickness...getting the wrench to grab hold of the nut was an entire other feat! Finally have the wheels placed and ready to use my new table!I move it to the location it will live in for the remainder of WFH, place my laptop on it, and give it a test run. I adjust the height so it's about 5 inches from my lap and I'm about 10 minutes, the table was literally on my lap. It doesnt stay in place! I thought maybe I didnt tighten it enough. I give all the knobs a good turn and notice one of the knobs doesnt even fit into the hole they're supposed to go into! I now keep a wrench next to me so I can loosed, readjust the height, and tighten the table into place.",0,0,0,0

R2SRWDNRX3MGMG,"Beside starring Milla Jovovich, there is no redeeming quality to this film.Most of the CGI is a joke. Even for 2006 it's actually a joke. Videogames looked better than the CGI in this film back on the PS2, not even exaggerating.The actions scenes are pretty awful. Sometimes you can just tell it's just dudes on a set doing an action scene. Other times it's just Milla killing 10 dudes instantly and you can't tell how it's done. The enemies might as well be mannequins because they pose no threat. The boss fight, or end fight, is done in a completely black room with flaming swords, which in your imagination would be pretty sweet, all we can see are the swords and the constantly moving  camera makes that hard to see. So we can't see anything.Then there's the plot. I either don't know what's going on or I don't care. A few times, including the finale, you see Milla get fatigued and lose control of her hands.

After printing less than 10 pages in the first month of ownership, the printer stopped printing.  This Epson printer initially worked great.  Now it goes through the motions, but pages come out completely blank showing error code Ox9D.  After wasting valuable time with customer service and exhausting the squence of steps directed by the printer, I searched online for a remedy and followed all available instructions, but this printer is useless.  I replaced the small temporary ink cartridges as directed and discarded them - a popular recommended remedy is to re-insert the temporary ink supply cartridges and power it up.  Based on Amazon reviews, I believed I was buying an ideal printer that I could rely on for years to come so I purchased $60+ supply of ink to be well equipped for future needs.  After only 6 months, I realize this printer is only suitable as filler for a garbage dumpster.  I have an Epson label maker than works great, but proceed with extreme caution before buying an Epson printer.

The ink cartridges were dried up and it would not print in color. I contacted the seller and told them the problem. They sent me an RMA to send it back instead of a few ink cartridges. I bought them myself. It started printing in color although the quality was not very good. I was in a bind for a printer so I made it work MY MISTAKE!!. I expected the quality to get better. IT HAS NOT.Problem 2. Its SUPER slow. No matter whether you print or copy its SLOW! VERY SLOW!Problem 3. You cannot copy or scan 2 sided documents automatically from the document feeder.Problem 4. The Bluetooth interface drops the job even when I am close by.Problem 5. When you chose best quality it goes HYPER-SLOW. When you use standard quality the document is washed out. I have done head cleaning g routines many times with no or little improvement.I liked the description of the printer. I liked the reviews. Unfortunately its just not working and I have had to go next door to do all my printing and copying.This machine took over one hour to print 25 pages (using best quality.)

The film was designed to look like a living graphic novel and or comic book as opposed to a movie based on a comic book. The problem for me was the color correction where they tried to make everyone look painted in a blown out kind of way was extremely distracting. Especially with the closeups. The digital effects were also poorly done from that standpoint as well. They wanted stylized, but it just looked shoddy. I appreciated the prologue at thew beginning but it wasn't enough to get me connect before diving right into the action and the script is pretty much a mess.

R1YWJL8R92TUVY,"There is no doubt I enjoyed the amazing clarity of the video. It's noticeably better than the streaming version on Amazon thanks to the advancement in big screen TV (I suspect any 55""+ would do). Unfortunately, I only had half of the fun because the sound level of the disc I received has only about half of what normal videos should be. I had to crank the amplifier, but the quality is not a theater like. I contacted Amazon customer service and was promptly offered to return it. She explained Amazon gets those discs from vendors like any of the stores. I'd like to think this is a one-off experience. With Amazon's policy, I'm not worried and certainly will buy more Blu ray discs. But be aware.Actually this is the first time I watch a Blu ray not counting the occasional glance at Best Buy floor. It's an ""old"" movie. I bought it because this movie is a milestone for Hollywood production. As such, I have very high expectation on the time spent on viewing it again.

RUAD1NJRGALOK,"I will preface my review by saying this is the first James Patterson book I have read.  As I started the book, I found myself wondering why I would care about the fate of the victim, not because I'm cold, but because there was such little substance.  Along the way, I started to care simply because murder is not pretty but mostly because I'd bought the book and started it.  The characters were slowly built up with lots of fluff thrown in, as well as choppy new chapters that didn't seem like they had to be new chapters at all, and seemed like they occurred almost every other page.  I found myself gawking at how the book could go from page 123 to page 127, with exactly ONE page of actual text between the pages.  There was no gripping pace, or 'need to read 'til you drop' feeling until VERY close to the end.  Even then, I walked away wondering why I'd bothered finishing the book.  I also wondered how this book could be a New York Times Bestseller...but then again, I bought it too!  I much prefer the rapid pace of John Grisham and Greg Iles.",0,0,0,0

RWNV7VDYE6YCE,"There are some times I really don't understand why people like what they do. According to a Q poll published in 1998, this is a more loved album than Dark Side Of The Moon or Abbey Road. I don't really hear anything all that interesting or exciting here. People seem to be hearing genius. I listen to The Fat Of The Land and I hear monotonous drivel, that neither goes anywhere, nor has even half the amount of musical ideas you'd hope for from a fifty minute album. Songs go on and on, and I don't think that anyone who's not a huge fan of this sort of techno is going to like this much.Not everything on The Fat Of The Land is bad, though. ""Breathe,"" easily the best track, succeeds in making a groovy, danceable atmosphere with the constant rhythm actually working well and not growing tiresome for a whole four minutes. It's also surprising to find that, while ""Narayan"" does repeat itself way too much in places, it is far from as bad as you'd expect as a nine-minute tune from an album like this. Parts of it are actually really good. The ending, though repetitive, does manage to still hold interest. The intro to ""Mindfields"" is good, although the song eventually blows itself to hell after that by slipping back into the same thing we've heard over and over here.But the rest... yuck. ""Funky Sh*t"" has nothing going for it at all, the predictable beats backed by the line ""That's some funky sh*t!"" repeated over and over throughout the song. Not what I want to hear. And the rapping on ""Disel Power"" is atrocious, some of the worst I've ever heard, and I'm not even going to mention the awful lyircs. ""Firestarter"" is (and I never thought I'd say this) too British for its own good, some worthless rants with an accent that really doesn't fit the music at all, and rather it seems to be the emphasis of the vocal delivery. What a joke. The attempt at aggression in ""Fuel My Fire"" falls flat on its face, turning out no more than laughable.God knows why this was (and still is) so big. Most of it just sounds like generic techno, nothing groundbreaking, innovative or even interesting. It all sounds the same to me, repeated over and over until, *yawn*, is it over yet? Finally. If it weren't for ""Breathe,"" I would gladly give this album one star.",0,0,0,0
RPLBLPR094VFL,"In spite of reviews warning about the limited range of this device, I ordered one to check it out.  Setup could not have been easier.  The device works fine on my iPhone but my Nokia although it connects is a real pain to use because of the constant static and clicking.  In the setup manual it actually says 10 feet for the location of your cell phones.  And it is really limited to 10 feet, otherwise it loses the signal.  This is a big limitation in that you must have your cell phones and the Gigaset pretty much on the same counter or at least the same room to get it to work.  I don't know why they built in this limitation on range.  My Mini Cooper syncs to my cell phones at least 30-40 feet away in the driveway when it is started.  It only loses the signal when the car drives off.I think it's a technology that just isn't quite here yet.

RMT2TDWIZAIGY,"The odd 2 cents worth:  First off.... the best thing about this release is certainly the live show. The sound quality and mix are good with the piano more prominent than in the original radio broadcast. All the performances are the unedited originals, though some of the intros are from other shows for some reason (Candle..., Danny Bailey). And conspicuously absent are the references to the state of Elton's voice (""I have a dreadful cold  -  but I will stumble my way through everything and we will all have a good time. That is guaranteed, I hope"".... ""We're gonna do a song which you can help me out on 'cause I've got a dodgy voice  -  and it's called GYBR""). I guess they were hoping any first time listeners wouldn't notice. Hopefully they'll get around to releasing the '74 Hammersmith show at some point  -  he's certainly in better vocal shape for that one. And of course it would have been great to have heard some of the tunes that were undoubtedly on the set list that night which didn't make the broadcast. *Dreadful cold* notwithstanding, an hour and 40 min. is a bit short for an Elton gig, even for the early years.  The DVD.... (oh boy).... the version I taped off a formerly-entertaining cable music channel in '95 was considerably cut from the original showing, clocking in at about 52 min. And according to the note I had left with that copy, it was missing performances of Elderberry Wine, ....Alice, and Crocodile Rock (as well as more interviews?). This would have been compared with the audio tape I had made from the 90 min. network showing in '73/'74 (and whose location today is a bit of a mystery). So here we are in 2014, and this eagerly awaited finally-on-digital version gives us a whopping.... 45 min? I could understand, for perhaps Elton's personal reasons, the missing bits of commentary from his Mom, Dick James, or especially former manager John Reid, with whom there'd been a bit of legal action awhile back. But the performance footage, etc. which must've brought it all to at least 75 min. originally?.... major dropping of the ball. I guess it shouldn't be a surprise that there was no closed captioning, as well. Anyway...  The contemporary covers and extras disc:.... there are just 3 of the covers that do anything for me  -  those by John Grant, Imelda May, and Zac Brown (Ed Sheeran's Candle... needs to be slowed down quite a bit). And if we're supposed to be shocked by Fall Out Boy's ""old man's .... than a barrel full of monkeys"" line  -  well I just get struck by it's *grammatical incorrectness*. I was hoping for more of a lasting impression from these, since 7 of the 9 were produced by singer/producer extraordinaire Peter Asher.  Oh well.  These tracks would've been a good choice for an *exclusive bonus* disc at your favorite local retailer type-of-thing, as opposed to being part of the actual release. And speaking on behalf of those who have also been listening from the beginning, I think a better bonus inclusion would have been Davey Johnstone's solo LP from '73, Smiling Face, especially since it's only cd release (from '03) has been out of print for years now. It's got Elton's harmonium on one track, Nigel, Dee, and Ray Cooper on much of the rest, and was produced by Gus Dudgeon. (Recently added my thoughts to it's amazon listing, where you can pay upwards of $100 for it if you're so inclined). As for the bonus tracks portion.... it's a real head-scratcher as to why they would be compelled to include Whenever You're Ready fading in and out from 2 other tracks as it was heard on the Lady Samantha compilation  -  especially since it's been re-released properly on at least 3 other collections (Rare Masters, to be Continued, and the '95 release of Don't Shoot Me). It's here because it was originally on the b-side of Saturday... (along with Jack Rabbit), but without the fades, of course. And Philadelphia Freedom and Pinball Wizard.... what the ??.... they were both about a year and a half from seeing the light of day, with Caribou in the interim.  Relevance?  Aside from the Grey Seal demo, the only gem here for me is the acoustic Candle....  Now that's good stuff.... didn't they have any other options as far as remixes, alternate takes, etc? How 'bout some *backing track only* action on Love Lies Bleeding, or Bennie and the Jets without the studio-added *live concert* track? I know the *new* mix of Candle... was on the 30th Ann. edition as well  -  I didn't spring for that one since I'd already gotten the DVD from that set separately. (Which reminds me  -  if anyone happens to know what the running time on that DVD is, I'd appreciate it if you'd pass that along. Just wondering if they made any cuts to that one as well).  The book:.... the other saving grace of the set (besides the concert, that is).... lots of good visual stuff  -  picture sleeves, articles, costumes etc., and an essay I don't need a magnifying glass to read. The only thing it could've used is some more info on the cover art/artist (Ian Beck  -  apparently still working these days).  Which brings me to the album itself.... kind of a moot point, paradoxically enough.  Haven't actually listened to it yet.  The one copy I got on cd over the years is the MFSL release, so I don't expect there to be any noticeable improvement here regarding sound quality. And another reason I didn't go for the 30th Ann. release was that I've never been interested in the whole *5.1 audio* thing, since most of my listening is done with headphones and I don't expect to grow another 3.1 ears anytime soon. (Must've been a reason Quadrophonic didn't catch on back then).  So all in all I'd like to give this whole kit and kaboodle a 5 out of 10, but since 1/2 stars aren't an option it has to be a 2, based on the chopping up of the film and on what the covers/ bonus disc could have been. But for those of you who are nowhere near receiving your AARP card, have no previous recollection of the Bryan Forbes film, and are more inclined to want to listen to acts that can make the pop charts in the 21st century.... by all means ignore 90% of this and enjoy.",0,0,0,0

Instead, the only thing that matters is being born in an environment of poverty, and then learning that wealthy folks exist. One of his many ridiculous comments is that “high rates of violence, particularly of murder, by white southern males…..(who) would shoot each other at Fourth of July picnics.”  Coincidentally, southern Chicago just had 100 shootings last Fourth of July.  He actually states “Warrior gene my ass”.  He also claims that “Global Warming” is responsible for violent behavior.The two questions he does not answer are:  1. Why do most “educators”, entertainers, and “journalists” exhibit extreme and fanatical liberal behavior (genes or environment)?  2. In the world today, why do those pockets of primitive tribal behavior (Hadza, Mbuti, Batwa, Gunwinggu, Andaman, Batak, Semang, Inuit, and Urban Warriors) still exist?I should add that I enjoyed the author’s writing style and humor but not the manipulation, cherry-picking, and misrepresentation of scientific data to promote his personal bias.",0,0,0,0

Some parts are just pathetic as when Sedaris uses drugs.  My suggestion is to read a library copy first and then buy his books if you find them worth the money.",0,0,0,0

R3A9KD8NJDFW9P,"It seems that Kevin Smith has fairly run out of ideas and very few of the moments in ""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back"" inspire so much as a chuckle.Low-brow juvenile humor can be some of the best when done with flair, but there is little flair here just a rehashing of characters, a littany of gay-innuendo jokes so much so it seems an obsession, a couple of worn-out and dated nods to Star Wars, and endless flat senseless dialogue.  The Silent Bob skit has run its gamut and his silence is more annoying than funny.  When he does speak its not set-up, it's not ironic, it's not much more than just explaining a routine comment leading the inane plot along it's treacherous course through the doldrums of comedy hell.A litany of F-bombs does not equal funny expect when it's presented in a funny context, said in a funny way, or set-up to get the laughs.  In Jay and Silent Bob the characters drop expletive after tired expletive and expect you to laugh without any nod to humor involved. I just want to try to save you from this DVD before Jay and Silent Bob Strike you in a most unfunny way.  Move on...there's little to laugh at here.",0,0,0,0

Our grand kids can't sharpen pencils because you can't put any pressure on the pencil or the machine stops working.  Eventually, if you fuss with it, you can get a sharp pencil.  I would not buy this again,  and I'd advise others to look elsewhere, especially if young kids will be sharpening pencils.I'll also add that the people who are selling this item emailed me and said they would give me a replacement if I retracted my review.

R2VP6KE3UUGPW4,"Started out pretty well. Packaged well, all the components seemed heavy duty and the cushions seemed well ""cushy"".  Putting it together wasn't difficult, but some of the screws didn't align with the holes.  It took some tweaks and ultimately it worked out.First thing, I liked the look of it.  It is heavy and again seemed heavy duty.  Now I bought this to replace my Staples econo-chair and researched looking for a chair for my size.  I am 6'4"" and dangerously close to 300 lbs.  When I first sat down, it was really stiff.  The back hit me in a very weird angle and it wasn't comfortable.  I figured I would let it break in.  That said; the bottom of the chair didn't come out any further than my econo Staples chair.  So what happens is that the cushion ends in a way that is uncomfortable for my legs after long periods.I still would have gave it 4 stars up to this point.  But now, not having it even 3 months and the thing squeaks everytime I move in it.  Loudly!  In addition to that, it has broke in and the results are worse not better.  The bottom cushion feels like a board after about an hour of sitting.  My back hurts more with this than any other chair I have used.So if you are a larger human being and want a comfortable chair to sit in for significant periods of time, I cannot recommend this chair for you.  If you are smaller than me and only use it for an hour at a time, then this should work fine, but there are cheaper alternatives that can do that.",0,0,0,0

R238N27WELVCO2,"Oh my god this is a horrible piece of junk. I bought it based on the other reviews, but I've been horribly disappointed by both the quality of the product and the customer service of the company. My first unit took a couple of months to arrive. It lasted all of two days before it went into this non-stop beeping mode and could not be reset. I called their support and after listening to it beep they sent out another unit. The next unit lasted about a day and started doing the same thing. I tried contacting them again but they claim to never have received my email. (They received it before, so seems strange that all of a sudden they don't receive my emails.) So, I have to wait for a time when I can call them again. Now they say they can't send me another because it is past 30 days. So now I have to send it in to be repaired. I asked what was wrong with the first unit and they said it was MELTED. They also tell me that I need to turn off the power and unplug it at night because these units melt inside if they're left plugged in. WHAT?? Yep, they say they see melted boards because people leave them plugged in over night. Oh great, that seems like a really solid piece of equipment you're selling that can't stand being plugged in. What a piece of junk. It is too late for me to get my money back. I've already bought a different manufacturers unit and this is just a sad waste of my money. I feel like I've been ripped off.

RHRF643W13D52,"Like many of the readers, I have heard the exaggerated hype of this book and curiosity killed the cat, because I decided to buy it. After struggling through the first couple of chapters, I managed to get a certain ""flow"". It was not that ""Just one more page... just one more page.."" flow, it was more likely that ""come on, you can do it... finish this book!"". After two months, I managed to finish it and frankly, this is was the most arduous task I ever had to do.It was not because I am a slow reader, it was because I had to put the book down and breath before I send it hurtling through the window.Often, when I have to read a book for school I do not like, I usually go on Sparknotes, but this... There was no Sparknotes around.First off, I will completely ignore the tangible fact that Paolini used every cliche plot known to the fantasy world and his obvious inspirations from the other fantasy books. Let's focus on the writing and the way in which he told the story. An ant crawling held my attention longer than this book did. Too much descriptions, and many times, they were seemingly inserted in random places that disrupted the flow of the story. I want to see the battle in my head, not see how many furs or whatever on an Urgal's body!The dialogue seemed force and unnatural. Paolini, I know you have been homeschooled, but honestly, did you ever have any regular interactions with the rest of the world? Sometimes they are so ridiculously corny, I had to laugh.And the characters. Oh boy. Eragon. That boy drove me crazy. Sometimes I hoped that Paolini wrote that one of the other characters stuck tape over Eragon's mouth. It is not a good idea to sell a book if people despises the main character.Another thing, Paolini's exaggeration of the elven beauty completely sickened me. Strangely, I have this vision where Paolini was once a fat little kid with thick glasses crying because no one played with him and he dreamed of having his own princess. I do not wish to bash him so harshly, but on his website, he seems so egoistical like he is the world's most brilliant writer. You cannot help but be ticked off.My review is long enough as it is and if you wish to know more about this horribly written book, there are other detailed reviews that can tell you more. For those who tell me that I should give him a break because he started writing a book when he was fifteen and somehow managed to get it published... well, I give him one star for that feat. I am writing a long fantasy novel, too. I understand how difficult it is.Maybe years and years of more school and experience can help Paolini write a better story.",0,0,0,0

REWDJNQTB1GSN,"The 2008 financial crisis and its roots have had many excellent books written about it.  ""Reckless Endangerment"" is not one of them.  This book really reads as though it was tailor-made for viewers of Sean Hannity, Glenn Beck, and Bill O'Reilly.The best book written about the roots of the financial crisis is ""All The Devils Are Here"", by Joseph Nocera and Bethany Maclean.  A close second would be ""The Lost Bank"", by WSJ reporter Kirsten Grind, which chronicles the collapse of Washington Mutual in wrenching detail.  Don't waste your time on ""Reckless Endangerment"", a very flimsy and intellectually lazy analysis of the crisis.""Reckless Endangerment"" at times reads like GOP talking points.  ACORN, a favorite old saw of Fox News,  is mentioned four times in the first 30 pages, while the first acknowledgement that George W. Bush was actually once President does not appear until page 148.  According to the authors, the financial crisis was caused almost exclusively by Fannie Mae pushing for more lending in communities that had been previously red-lined.  Barney Frank and former Fannie Mae CEO James Johnson gain a starring role as the central villains in the story.  The two obvious problems with this narrative are that Johnson retired from Fannie Mae 8 years before the collapse of Bear Stearns, and Barney Frank didn't become part of the House majority until early 2007, when subprime lending had almost entirely ceased.As for all of the other things that led to the financial crisis, they receive barely a mention in this book.  Credit default swaps are largely ignored, as is the rise of non-agency lenders like Ameriquest and New Century.  Collateralized Debt Obligations, particularly synthetic ones, receive almost no mention at all.  The pay-option ARMS which collapsed banks like Washington Mutual, Indy Mac, and Wachovia receive almost no mention, either.  The obviously flawed risk models of rating agencies like Moody's or S&P, don't receive much mention, either.The unfortunate truth of the 2008 financial crisis is that it had many causes and many guilty co-conspirators.  The GSEs clearly deserved a share of the blame, and no one can deny the clear conflict of interest in their missions as private firms with a government charter.  But many of the causes of the financial crisis had nothing to do with the GSEs.  Pay-option ARMs and second liens were both decidedly non-agency products.  Credit default swaps and super-senior CDO tranches had nothing to do with Fannie or Freddie.  Other books, such as ""All The Devils Are Here"", do  a much better job of putting this all in perspective.",0,0,0,0

R3QP70JPVNM1WN,"Madeline Hunter can really write, but this book was one of her less enjoyable efforts.  I liked the fact that she tackled a war that is rarely mentioned in romance novels.  The history provided is accurate without overwhelming the story.  Those attributes made the story worth 2 stars to me.  The characters and the repetitive ideas concerning the romance between them were disappointing.The main couple consists of an English Lord and the daughter of a former Welsh leader.  Marcus is in the service of King Edward, holding lands in the conquered territory of Wales. Nesta is a Welsh loyalist. The story takes place during one of the Welsh rebellions against England.  This could have been a great tale.  Unfortunately I couldn't really love either character.  Marcus was weak and gullible, constantly risking being destroyed by Edward just to keep Nesta with him.  This would have been romantic if Nesta had been worth the risk.  Nothing about her was likable.  She ruthlessly risked her own neck and Marcus's by committing numerous acts of treason to help the Welsh rebellion.  He ran in circles trying to keep her from getting herself hung, meanwhile losing the respect of his peers and chancing forfeiture of his family's home, land, and status.  When he would open his heart to her, she would lose her temper and tell him there was no love between them.  The only time Marcus and Nesta were not fighting was when they were ""making love"".  (But don't dare call it ""love"" when speaking to Nesta...  she insists it is only ""lust"".)  The whole book repeated these themes over and over.  I could not see why Marcus would think she was worth the gamble, which made me see him as a total sap.Irritating characters , repetition, and no true romance... not a great combo.  Hunter's use of realistic events made it worth finishing the book, although many pages were skimmed through.",0,0,0,0
R1GLMRJGV9BFQK,"This novel starts off with a promising premise: a fifteenth-century Flemish painting conceals clues about a centuries-old murder.  The protagonist, a beautiful, chain-smoking art restorer, is determined to solve the puzzle.  Soon she herself becomes the target of a murder plot that appears to mimic the chess game depicted in the painting.  An interesting lesson in art collecting and chess?Well, not really.  The fifteenth-century murder was what hooked me at the beginning of the book, but this mystery is imprecisely resolved and summarily dismissed in favor of the modern cat-and-mouse game that embroils the heroine.  If Perez-Reverte had managed to supply a cast of characters with more depth, this present day plot might have proved just as interesting as the older one.  Instead, he reminds us endlessly of how beautiful our protagonist is, and how fond she is of vodka, but does little else in the way of character development.  Her friends, a drably portrayed chess player and a flamboyantly gay antiques dealer, are equally one-dimensional.  With each, Perez-Reverte latches onto a single trait (alternately expressive and vacant eyes and a supposedly endearing father-figure role, respectively) and repeats them ad nauseum.  This is annoying, not enlightening.  By the time I reached the end of the book, the flimsy solution and lack of a convincing motive were no surprise at all.This is my first experience reading Perez-Reverte.  I may give him another chance, but not soon.  My advice on this one?  Read the first few chapters for an intriguing set-up (it's worth the two stars I'm giving it), then write your own conclusion.  Chain smoking and vodka are optional.",0,0,0,0

R2KB74VSWKW1I3,"Out of every single purchase I have ever made on Amazon, I have never had a single bad experience except with this product. It doesn't even come close to working as it should. I started by testing it out with 50 clean pennies I COUNTED ahead of time. The coins were not properly sorted, the pennies went into the nickel slot AND penny slot, the machine jammed (from only 50 pennies...come on). The wrapper also filled up before the pennies were even full so that you can't even trust the count. Already I was working with a piece of garbage product, but I decided to throw in a bunch of coins and see what it did with them. It immediately jammed (again these are clean, newish coins) and wouldn't fix itself as advertised. So I then had to figure out how to remove the jam. But there is NO WAY TO TAKE APART ANY OF THE PIECES. You can't separate the overflow tray, you can't lift the lid entirely off, you cant take out the whole sorter to remove the jam. I had coins going down into the power supply area, coins jammed in places you couldn't reach, I ended up having to take the whole thing upside down and shaking it until most of the coins fell out, then I had to detach the back panel which, again, DOESN""T detach all the way and fish around for all the coins that fell back there.

I installed the new shaver heads and upon using them for the first time they took twice as long and didn’t shave nearly as close as my used ones.

The dialogue is not very well written, even Patrick Stewart can't rise above it and make his part shine. Bad casting on the part of the lead character, he's a terrible actor. BUT, the worst thing about the film is the pacing. It starts out okay, but towards the end it's just a constant barrage of very rushed dissolves that glaze over many important parts of the story. I understand that films need to move more quickly than books to keep interest, but this is just egregious. They take what should be a 4-hour epic movie and cut it down into this cinematic disappointment. I hope that someday they make a film (or series of them) that do reasonable justice to the book.

R3WRJWFDZKUVO,"I am in real estate. I use my HP laser color printer a great deal to print flyers and other documents. My printer is an expensive one and I have only had it for about a year.  I decided to take a chance and order this product for my toner vs. the more expensive HP toners.  The reviews were good so I felt comfortable with my order. WHAT A MISTAKE THAT WAS!!  The cartridges arrived and were mounted in a styrofoam holder and they each had a simple black plastic sleeve over them. The instructions mentioned a pull tab for each of the 4 cartridges.  None of the cartridges had a pull tab. I think that is / was the problem as the manufacturer must have skipped that step. I installed them, ran some test pages and there was a noticeable leak of toner on the pages so I had the HP clean itself. This did not help.  These toner cartridges have leaked and ruined all of my expensive paper and I had to throw out my printing and send my PDF files to a printer because I cannot use the ones I printed.

RA4LAH83VFQA0,"I received this copy from the publisher via NetGalley, in exchange for an honest review.""Our city is here, somewhere, but we are not. We are all untied, is the thing. Untethered, floating, drifting, all these things.""This was such a weird and uncomfortable read. While I thought the style in which this short story/novella was written was rather artistic, I disliked the crude manner in which everything was described.This story tells about a futuristic dystopian era where London is suddenly overtaken by water. Families are forced from their homes, and many separated in the flooding. Written from the perspective of a young mother, she details the experience while nurturing her new son ""Z"" (Zeb but characters are only mentioned by the first letter in their name) through explanations in the past and present tenses and sometimes somewhere in-between.Along the way, she is separated from her spouse, ""R"" and was left to fend for herself and child. While there is certainly a lot going on in their lives with trying to survive, Z serves as a lantern in the dark to those around. The reader passes through stages of the book as Z grows from an infant into a toddler. Everything around him is so dismal and hopeless, yet, he lightens the mood with his meager but notable milestones.""Luck is one of those words that has no meaning anymore if it ever did.""While I've never quite read a book in this fashion, I appreciated its attempts at originality. However, I believe it may serve other readers better, who may enjoy the writing style of someone similar to Margaret Atwood. The vulgar ways of explaining different things (mainly with Z and the motherly roles required of the main character) were most off-putting. I couldn't help but be reminded of the descriptive writing tactics of The Handmaid's Tale which I absolutely loathed.Overall, I appreciated the artist manner in which the author told this story. However, the off-putting way in which she described things and need for more atmosphere and grounding made this less enjoyable in my eyes.Vulgarity: There are a few swear words, I believe. The entire writing style could be considered as vulgar (as stated above) as the author uses descriptive and unpleasant ways of describing bodily functions and reactions between mother and child.Sexual content: While there are no scenes to be spoken of, there are references to sex in somewhat graphic manners. In particular, in the beginning where the main character is discussing her plans for childbirth, along with reminiscing about her significant other and how he ""moved inside her.""Violence: None.1.5 stars.",0,0,0,0

Allows me to scan multiple pictures at a time and place them into individual tiff or jpeg files in one step.  Duplex printing works well.  Copy functions allows for image preview of copy before you actually print the copy allowing you to make adjustments without wasting paper and ink.  I replaced a very thirsty Lexmark after 24 months use because it consumed large quantities of maintenance ink with this Epson.  I'm very satisfied.

This one lasted me 3 years of very light home use.  In the end, the print quality became very poor.  I purchased mine in February 2015,  It became unusable for printing this month.  In 2018, I was running nozzle cleaning every day before I could print.  Sometimes several times a day.  Over the last year, the print quality has fallen off so I replaced it with a  Brother Laser HL-L2370DW.  What a sweet deal.  I bought it at Best Buy for $99.00.  Toner cartridges cost $40.00.  Effective cost per page is 3.5 cents per PC Magazine which gave it an Editors Choice for 2018.  That's half the cost per page of an inkjet per Consumer Report with laser print quality.

RPONFQDVYDGOU,"I am really surprised by all of the 5 star reviews of this book.  It will inspire you to cook, it is very interesting reading on the history of pork in the south and the rivalries it creates, but as an actual cook book I think it misses the mark and is definitely not 5 star material.Pros:  - The few pictures in the book will make you hungry!  - The recipes are well written and easy to follow while cooking.  - There are a ton of recipes in this book for everything from soup to bread and salads to meat.  - Most recipes are simple with few ingredients. (Easy to prepare)Cons:  - I didn't sit and count but the picture to recipe ratio is very low.  Most of the recipes do not have pictures.  - Most recipes are simple with few ingredients. (Easy to prepare but the result is bland)  - The recipes that we have tried produce bland food.  When I think of southern cooking I think of rich and flavorful food but these are closer to school cafeteria food than your favorite BBQ restaurant.  - Did I say there are not enough pictures?  I don't know about everyone else but it takes a bit of inspiration for me to go through the effort and possible disappointment of trying a new recipe.  Usually that inspiration comes in the form of pictures that well, make me drool.  I want that food so bad I can taste it.  Or at least I want to taste it bad enough to go to the store, buy the ingredients, bring them home and cook the food.  This is a VERY thick book with way too few pictures.  - The recipes sound fantastic but I strongly recommend you use them as a starting point.  Go to your favorite recipe site and compare recipes and most importantly read the reviews before you invest your time and energy in preparing the food.About us:We are very experienced cooks even taking several culinary classes. Mexican, Italian, and BBQ make up pretty much our entire food pyramid. I get compliments on my food all the time and people ask me to show them how to grill meat.

The only two things going for it are beautiful Parisian scenes, and a screenplay with many wonderful possibilities--unfortunately mostly unrealized, in my view. The most annoying aspect of the movie is Woody Allen's heavy hand in interjecting his own distinct voice in all the proceedings. Owen Wilson's character is a second-rate copy of a fake Woody Allen, from his manner of speaking and use of his body down to the content of his thoughts.

R7IZUKMQIMD6V,"I'm very disappointed by this book.  Mr. Lawhead is one of my favorite writers, but ""Patrick"" is his weakest book so far (even compared to his early Dragon King series).  I have to wonder, with other reviewers, just what ""flavor"" of Christian Mr. Lawhead is.As for Pelagius...yes, he was acquitted by a pope--Pope Zosimus.  BUT--Zosimus was preceded by Pope Innocent (d. 417), who had *condemned* Pelagius and his disciple Coelestius. Two North African synods held in 416, and the General Council at Carthage in 418 also *condemned* Pelagius' doctrine.  ""Zosimus then retreated from his earlier position and published an epistle requesting that all bishops subscribe to the canons of this council"" of Carthage (R.C. Sproul, ""Willing to Believe"", 44).If you want to enjoy Stephen Lawhead's writing, read the Song of Albion trilogy or the first three books of the Pendragon Cycle.  Those are his best works, IMHO.  If you want to learn about the REAL St. Patrick, read his ""Confession"" and ""Breastplate Prayer"".  There's no fuzzy theology or Pelagian nonsense there.",0,0,0,0

R24XVYI4XGNXG3,"First off, there are several editions of this book available from different publishers, this review refers to a version with no real indicator of the publisher, the cover of this edition has a pair of orange/yellow Owl eyes at the bottom, on a black background with a golden-leaf border around the title, author and eyes.I read this book a couple years ago on the recommendation of a friend (who loaned me her copy) and I loved it! I thought it was a brilliant little satire of a society that puts too much emphasis on class and I thought that the idea of a two-dimensional being doubting the existence of a third dimension was hilarious. I laughed at how, in the second dimension, the number of sides one had would determine class, with Isosceles triangles being the lowest class and equilateral triangles being the class immediately above them- I laughed at the brief history of Triangle Civil Rights and upward mobility. This book is full of little things like that, but as it is a short book I won't give too many examples. In short, I was laughing constantly at jokes surely only a nerd like myself could love.The only thing about this book is that there really isn't a story- the first two thirds lays out the premise of life in the second dimension (the previously mentioned class system and triangle civil rights, how everything in the second dimension looks like a straight line and how they compensate for it, how their society views and treats women etc.) with the last part serving as ""the story"" - the two-dimensional narrator's interactions with a third dimensional being and the resulting revelations. Or as I half-jokingly put it- ""The story of a square who wanted to be a cube."" When it comes down to it, the story really only serves as a vehicle for the premise of life in the second dimension. That being said, I highly recommend reading this book- just not this edition.So, the first sentence of this review, I described the cover as having a pair of owl eyes on it; looking back, those eyes should have been the first indicator that something was not right- there are no birds or any real sort of wild animal in Flatland, and this cover seems like it would be better suited for a story that takes place in the jungle- or perhaps for a suspense novel; however none of this occurred to me until after I had placed the order.I had read several reviews on Amazon about editions of this book that did not contain illustrations, so the first thing I did when I received my copy was to check the illustrations- having read this book before I knew that the handful of illustrations were simple, hand-drawn diagrams of shapes and occasionally arrows to indicate motion (as this book takes place in a world where everything is literally just a 2D shape, that makes sense- all the illustrations look like diagrams you would expect to find in a 19th century Geometry textbook); you can imagine my surprise when the illustrations were detailed (though poorly reproduced and black and white) depictions of religious scenes from various faiths. I'm not kidding, I think somebody working for the publisher forgot to do quality control at the last step and the image files for this book got swapped with the image files for a book about religion. I flipped through the book very briefly just to make sure- I saw the Baptism of Christ, I saw Shiva, I think I saw Joseph Smith and Brigham Young in there somewhere but I did not see the simple, hand-drawn diagrams of Flatland. I then put the book down in disgust and began the return process.Very good book, very bad edition.",0,0,0,0

R39K16Z3P2LEGJ,"Many people review PhonePower service and give it 5 stars soon after they get it. Believe me, I would've done the same thing just 6 months ago. But I give them 1 star and here's why. I switched to PhonePower 18 months ago and was a happy customer for a year. After that it all went downhill. I started having problems, couldn't make calls, couldn't receive calls. Called tech support, they do try to help but after a few days the service would be dead again and I would call again and someone would try to help again. One day I spent 1.5 hours on the phone with their tech guy who went through everything and couldn't tell what the problem was but after a few ""unplug, plug back in"" tries it started to work again only to die a few days later. After trying many different things and dealing with restarting the PhonePower adapter on a DAILY basis, I was convinced that it was the adapter that had gone bad and I needed to replace it. So I call tech support, complain about no service and ask for a new adapter that I could try out. Every time they refuse to do that (even though they say they could technically do it) but first they give you a ticket number, tech support calls you, asks you to restart the adapter a few times, the phone works again, problem solved, yeah, UNTIL it dies again the NEXT day. I call again and ask for a new adapter and mention that I've dealt with tech support numerous times but the problem is still there and all I want is to try out a new adapter. They say their normal procedure is to have a tech guy call you and diagnose the problem. They sound like a broken record and there seems to be no way around it. I even threatened to cancel the service and was told it's my choice to do so (of course it is but to me it sounds like they don't really care if I do). My problem is that I pre-paid 2 years of service (stupid idea but lesson learned) so the remaining 6 months would be a waste of money (I doubt they would give me my money back).So, if your service works like mine did for a year then great, but don't hold your breath, one day you might have to deal with this nonsense tech support.

RUZX1B7WANWJS,"I enjoyed Kaayla Daniel's talk at the Ancestral Health Foundation on broth (available on YouTube) and bought this book, despite my wariness of the Westin Price Foundation.  Although I'm sympathetic to their views, I prefer scientific method to anecdotal reports or epidemiological studies, but I had high hopes I would find useful material here from Daniel.Although Daniel is a lively presenter, the book is quite dull and the science available on some of the book's claims is quite thin.  I kept reading, hoping it would get interesting.  Instead, there was a lengthy literature review that included biographies of the scientists involved and which was bookended by ""we all know broth is good for you because of ancestral traditions"" kind of rhetoric.  The actual science could have been summarized in an article.  Spoiler: there is no original or recent research here.  I wish I'd known that beforehand.The second half was a lot of reader-submitted (not tested) recipes.  I learned more from reading Tamar Adler's writings about how to make a good broth (see her excellent Everlasting Meal) than I did from this book.  There are several traditions of broth-making, all of which could probably fill their own books.  Adler's excellent article for Vogue a few years ago comparing European and East Asian stocks is fascinating: she relates how one Japanese couple breaks bones with a hammer as part of a lengthy process to make the best ramen soup at their restaurant and the multiple strainings a French chef applies to his broth to make it as light and pure as possible.Unless you enjoy reading just to have your biases confirmed, really like knowing about early 20th century scientists lives (as in Bill Bryson's History of Everything), or have never made broth before and want to know the basics, I would skip this one.

R1I1LFU1F1CXZP,"The contempt the author repeatedly expressed for both science and education made this book inappropriate for my young boys, ages 4 and 6.  The author used the cute characters to mask his contempt for many of the things I value in my life, and you perhaps value in yours.I read this book at night to my 4 and 6 year olds. My four year old had chosen to read The Book of Pooh four times in a row.  I had used his interest in Pooh to help him learn other things, like math and drawing. I saw this book as a way to introduce some big philosophical concepts.This may very well be an introduction to Tao, I don't know. If ""The Way"" means basically ""To Criticize"" then this is it. The author's point seems to be ""Be Like Pooh."" The problem is, he cannot do it himself.  If the author acted more like Pooh, his book would not be so objectionable to my children. Can you imagine Pooh criticizing at all?When the author started talking about science as pointless and silly, my 6 year old (who was sitting in) asked what was wrong with science? He wants to be a scientist.  And when the author went on on a tirade about academics and school and even (ironically) books, I was shocked.  My boys are both in classes of some sort, and they don't know what to do with the author's low opinion of school.There were many of these gems of knowledge.  One other one I remember is that exercise is worthless. Better he says to just lay on the grass. No kidding. My kids are very active (as is Pooh) and I hope they are active their whole lives.  The advice in this book is questionable at best, and totally inappropriate for children.  If you are an adult, have failed at school, and sit on a couch all day, then this book will provide you with a justification.The author is a Talk Radio DJ, in the disguise as a mystic, putting on a puppet show starring Pooh.  He hijacks a childhood hero to vent his frustration at a failed college career. Underneath his ""be simple, like Pooh"" message is a great deal of anger and frustration that bubble to the surface in ill-chosen exaggerations about ""narrow minded science"" and ""irrelevant academia"" and joggers.  Did he not get tenure at Cal Tech, or something?  While he derides science as pointless study, one wonders if he drives a car, takes medicine, prints his books on printing presses, travels by some other means than his feet, in short... does he benefit from science?  If so, the word ""hypocrite"" springs to mind.We never finished the book.  My four year old, who is FAR more Pooh-like than the author, simply knew that something wasn't right, and would actually pick another book and read it silently while I read this book aloud.  He had never done that before, or since, and it was his Pooh way of telling me that this guy wasn't appropriate.  So when my six year old asked, ""How can he be against books - when he wrote one?""  we stopped.  The boy had a point.  Any author of a book who derides authors and readers of books for being too academic is clearly a fool.The author does not have the inner peace and sense of fun and play that Pooh possesses.  Instead, he parades these cute characters about and (from time to time) sneers hate-filled generalizations about things he chooses not to respect.  I hear his second book is the same, but worse.  If that is ""The Way"" then count me out.",0,0,0,0

R1D2NBDQ24U52U,"Many other reviews have pointed out how remarkable it was that Castaneda was able to write 87 books on his experiences with Don Juan, despite having only spent about 5 minutes with him in a chance meeting at a bagel joint near Times Square.  We often hear that Castaneda was comfortably ensconced in the bowels of the University Research Library at UCLA when he was supposedly wandering the Sonoran Desert with Don Juan.  However, it's not often mentioned that when Don Juan was supposed to be in the desert himself, he was actually in New York City, getting his hat blocked (in Sonora, for hat blocking, they know from nothing).  Their meeting was the inspiration for the Reese's Peanut Butter Cup commercial (""Hey!  You got peanut butter in my chocolate!""  ""Hey!  You got chocolate in my peanut butter!""  The rest is television history).In that encounter, Don Juan also imparted his tried-and-true methods for picking up women in bars and other venues; he was, after all, a real ""Don Juan.""  Castaneda has also written about this aspect of the master's teaching under various pseudonyms.  However, few are aware of Castaneda's forays into other religious traditions.  He was truly an eclectic spiritualist, dipping his toes into the pools of many esoteric waters.  Those interested should peruse his many other books, which if not available on Amazon, should be easily found in the ""used book"" section of your local Starvation Army outlet:The Teachings of Pope Don Paul II; a Catholic Way of KnowledgeThe Teachings of Rabbi Don Schneersohn; a Talmudic Way of KnowledgeThe Teachings of L.

R3638BX7ZC37AJ,"August 7, 2009 - UPDATEI have printed several pages since my first review and I am happy to report that the prints using the black inks have looked much better.  At the quality that I am receiving now, I would purchase these cartridges again.  I have used the cyan and yellow inks as well and have not had a problem with them.===============I received these in the mail.  They were individually wrapped GENERIC cartridges.  So were the colored ones that I ordered from the same company.  This is not what is pictured.  I opened one up today and the ink leaked all over my hands (Perhaps I squeezed it when I took off the plastic piece).  Anyway, I cleaned the cartridge up and placed it in my printer.

RUV43YI4PTJV0,"I learned recently that Tom Cruise and Mike Nichols had toyed with the idea of collaborating on a remake of The Heiress, with Cruise subbing for Montgomery Clift as Morris. To this end, they scheduled a viewing of said classic, sat through it, looked at each other...and ruefully concluded that with all due respect, there was no WAY they could come up with anything to compare with what they had just seen, much less better it. The project, mercifully, died in utero.Would that Michael Caton-Jones had possessed a similar grasp of reality and lack of hubris.Fred Zinnemann's 1973 The Day of the Jackal is on my shortlist of perfect films. The quintessential political thriller, it carries not an ounce of fat--there's not one extraneous frame or word of dialogue to mar the near-perfect visual re-creation of Frederick Forsyth's novel based on factual events in early-1960's France. Despite knowing its outcome before we even start watching, we're nevertheless on edge throughout the entire film, awed by the completely convincing cat-and-mouse game to which we're privy between two equally-matched, consummate professionals. Neither is personally involved with the task at hand--they're both just doing the jobs for which they've been hired.This film, on the other hand, is an abomination. Instead of Charles de Gaulle, the First Lady is targeted for assassination. Edward Fox's sleek, elegant Jackal is replaced by a mugging Bruce Willis, and it would seem that Sidney Poitier (who must've needed the money) is meant to be the equivalent of Michel Lonsdale's plodding, henpecked police inspector. What this amounts to is that we're treated to a predictably 90's-style counterpoint of physical types: Willis is white, Poitier is black. The whole effect, unfortunately, comes off beige.Myriad (gratuitous) characters are thrown into the pot, including Richard Gere as an incarcerated IRA terrorist with a bone to pick, sporting, in addition to one of the corniest Irish brogues in cinema history (right up there with Gable's Parnell), his trademark American Gigilo/Jesse Lujack swagger. I kept hoping Jerry Lee Lewis would break into ""Breathless""--it would've been an improvement over the pedestrian soundtrack. In addition, we're forced to deal with--God help us--""character development"" (the beauty of the original is that we're spared such contemporary ""essentials"" as motivation, psychology, romance, slow-motion confrontations, or even much of a soundtrack). High-tech equipment (including quasi pre-GUI computers and a rather unsubtle ""weapon of choice,"" which we're asked to believe is produced by someone--no doubt a savant of sorts--who probably couldn't order a hamburger at White Castle) and the obligatary shock-soaked special effects (including buckets of blood) are, presumably, meant to compensate for the woeful lack of substance.The Spotlight Reviewer is correct about Zinnemann's wanting to disassociate himself and his masterpiece from this mess, and his insistence on the title change; he died soon afterwards with his stellar reputation intact. I was unaware that Forsyth was similarly vocal but I'm not surprised. I wish it were possible to assign a zero-star rating to this gimmicky, self-indulgent disaster, if only on the basis of its rubbing our noses in Hollywood's inability to come up with and develop new material--how many inferior remakes of classics will we continue to be forced to deal with each year?My suggestion is to avoid this film at all cost and acquaint yourself with the original (available on Amazon for a pittance; you can't afford NOT to own it), a textbook example of how to produce a classic, despite its being given unsurprisingly pedestrian treatment on DVD by--guess which studio?--Universal. Contrast that disk with this Collector's Edition and all its extras and you're forced to wonder (alas, yet again) who's making the decisions over there and on what basis, especially considering that this film--deservedly--sunk like a stone almost immediately following its release.",0,0,0,0

R3MNJZ5UFLB3HP,"Dear Amazon;When I made my decision to watch Dune on Amazon and paid my money rental fee I rightly assumed it was going to be the Extended edition.

R2JPOR5HTE7PVA,"The ""survivalist"" character is dumb.  He prefers a pistol to a M4 rifle.  He walks right up to the bad guy, draws his pistol and points it at his face, then laughs and holsters it, telling him to get out by high noon.  It's great that he's good with his pistol, but that's totally unrealistic considering the advantages of an semi-auto long rifle over a pistol.The President's daughter, who is supposed to be 9-10yrs old, has the wit and humor of a 15-18yr old.  I have a few kids and it's clear that the author does not.If you want to read a modern western novel, this is it.  If you're looking for a realistic survival book, look elsewhere.  The editing was good and I only found one error, which was nice for a change in this genre.

Much of the plot is Star Wars, from the destruction of Luke's uncle's farm to the apprenticeship with Obi-wan (err....Brom), but then reverts to Middle Earth (the seige of Gondor and the killing of the Lord of the Nazgul) at the end.  And of course, the dragons and dragon-riders are straight from Pern.The descriptions are unbelievably overdone, from the ""it was a dark and stormy night"" school of literature.But despite all these faults, it was a fun read!

RTUGA30MCIUO6,"BUYER BEWARE!  Read the reviews before considering buying this.  The screws keep falling out on my palm pilot, and I've found that this is a problem that many people have had (just google ""Palm Replacement Screws"").  If you buy this, there's a good chance that you'll be the next person having the exact same issue - so be warned.  It may not seem serious, but screws coming out basically means your unit casing will come off and that leaves the memory and all the important things you write down in your schedule UNPROTECTED.When I contacted them about the issue, I found out what the Palm company was really all about.  That is, getting your money and not looking back.  Instead of admitting that their is a serious design flaw with their product, and doing what they could to rememdy the situation....they figure this is another way they ought to try and add to their profit margin.  Not very smart.  I'm not even asking them to apologize for their imcompitant case designs (which would help them save face imho).  What really gets me is that theres enough people that have this problem for it to be clearly visible to the higher ups, and some executives at the company actually made the decision that they would trade 75 cents in screws for the loss of their company name.  And If the guys running the PALM company are idiots, then it's time to look elsewhere.I can't believe they wouldn't just ship out replacements and try to fix the product designs.  But as I reseacrch the net to try and find some decent replacement screws for my own unit in the meantime, I just keep finding more and more stories of good people (who don't have problems with screws coming out of other small electronics btw) who are in the same pathetic PALM ownership boat as me.  Am I ever sorry I bought the unit.  Besides the screws, it has reset on me on a number of occasions and luckily I'm religious about backing up data.  Still, you lose some entries and its a major pain.  In fact, I did miss a meeting once because I missed  reentering it after the unit reset and lost data.Well Palm won't be fattening their margins on me anymore, and I hope you heed the warning I give.  I am in the market for a new Handheld, but I'll NEVER allow myself to get swindled by them again.  They could've used the problem as an opportunity to show their customers that they do value us and score some points.  Unfortunately for them and for us customers, the cold response I've gotten from them tells me that they really could care less and do not have a long term outlook on what it means to sell a business product as important as a scheduling device.  It's best to stay away from them.  I'm through giving PALM any more business.  If you find a better company, please do share.",0,0,0,0

R16OQ3Y1VNZZOE,"I've been using these cartridges in an Epson WF-2540 printer for months with no problem other than a warning message about them not being genuine Epson cartridges.  If I had done this review before yesterday, it definitely would have been a five star review.  However, yesterday one of these cartridges actually damaged my printer, rendering it inoperable.  Here's what happened.  After what should have been a routine replacement of the yellow cartridge, the printer reported that the cartridge was not installed correctly.  Removing the cartridge proved more difficult than usual, which seemed very odd.  (At the time, I thought this might just be due to a slightly tight fit along the sides of these cartridges.)  After removing and reinstalling the cartridge, I got the same message again.  It wasn't until I removed the cartridge the second time that I noticed the cartridge chip was missing.  Turns out the chip had somehow fallen off inside the grey plastic bag the cartridge is packaged in.  Unfortunately, even a genuine Epson cartridge won't work for me know, since the rough surface under where the chip should have been on the remanufactured chip damaged the chip contacts inside the printer.  Fortunately, after some research I found that the chip contacts are relatively inexpensive and can be fairly easily replaced.  However, even if this works as I hope, it has been a big time drain and pain in the butt.  Another troubling thing is that this does not appear to be a one-off situation.  The other yellow cartridge I have from the set I purchased has the same exact problem.  See pics of cartridge with disconnected chip and damage to contacts (which have been removed from the printer).

R35I26XGCUHAVE,"I am saddened to write this review but I feel like people should hear my experience with this product.. I had been using these hoses for my house-washing business (Year Round in Central FL) and I would dare to say that no one is harder on a professional-grade garden hose than a year-round house washer in central FL.The Tropical to Sub-tropical climate in conjunction with prolonged (Stays outside baking in the FL Sun on my trailer) High Ultra Violet exposure alone is tough on hoses.Ordered on Amazon April 26, 2022 Gilmour Flexogen Super Duty Gray 5/8 Inch X 100 Feet has already begun to not hold its shape and is flattening. I believe this hose used to be labeled as Professional and Sold at ACE Hardware and was Grey in color and had a Branded handle which has been replaced by a Spring. I use 2 X 100 foot hoses and a 50-foot hose together. On a 300-foot hose reel on my trailer.They get pulled all the way off and rolled up 5-8 times a day 5-6 days a week.I use enough hose to completely reach all the way around a typical Ranch to larger designer-style FL  stucco Home.For each home washed it gets pulled around 2 concrete foundation corners, against and around trees and bushes across the concrete driveways and sidewalks so much that the octagonal female ends are often rounded at the end of the hose's life.Over the years I have bought at least 20 hoses and never before had I been disappointed or let down by Flexogen.They generally last about a year and a half to two before they start sprouting leaks due to constant and repeated concrete friction in the heat of central FL. I turned in my hoses 1 time in 07 or 08 but had decided it was not fair to Flexogen as my usage is extraordinarily brutal.I have never claimed another warranty/RMA return sense because I Loved and respected companies build quality and the fact that the manufacturer just flat out made a fantastic product and stood by it with an unheard-of return policy.No More…These hoses are displaying qualities I had never seen in my 16 years + of professional use.The last few 3-5 years have shown the hoses start to flatten and do not retain their shape after 4-6 months of use.They are definitely not as thick as they used to be. I know this because when the ends get worn out I replace them with new brass ends and Sharkbite  Brand 3/4-in PEX Copper Crimp Rings in lieu of screw type hose clamps. I used to have to fight to get the hose barb in with the copper hose clamp in place. Now i have to add 2 wraps of electrical tape over the hose and under the clamps to get the clamp to work on the hose as the material thickness of the hose is not what it used to be.Most recently the inner liner now separates from the outer?  3 hoses in a row now have done this to me. One hose I had separated So badly that the inner liner collapsed reducing the flow of water to a trickle, making the hose totally unusable. It also made it impossible to repair the hose, which I depended on as a business downtime because when I am not spraying I am not making money.  Cutting off the bad section didn't help as I used to. Now it looks like the best hose they sell is black and I stay clear of black hoses seeing I don't want to leave marks on people's property from an incidental rub against siding or a white downspout or white PVC fence. The gray hoses leave no marks or discoloration. I may end up trying one of the black hoses but to date, I have yet to see a black hose in the High UV exposure of  Central Florida that does not oxidize and leave marks… Seems like most things these days are not made to last. I noticed the Quality drop around the time that ACE Hardware stopped selling them and started selling a copycat hose but it was green in color, that seemed to me to be the beginning of the end for the Quality of the Grey hoses. I guess that is the business model of today's corporations, engineered obsolescence and designed with limited life or made with profit margins first and foremost in mind. Maybe its just me but I feel like these days naive is the consumer that believes their interest is taken into consideration.",0,0,0,0

RNVX0AANF3SF,"I should have liked this movie. I'm a sci-fi and fantasy fan and can often enjoy even middle of the road quality movies in the genre. However, Inkheart was a huge let down for me and was actually painful to watch.The special effects were top notch and Brendan Frasier has some cache in the big screen fantasy genre, however, aside from these two elements it would be impossible to believe that this film saw theatrical release.The script, dialog, costumes, most of the acting, editing, physical sets, music and most of all directing had the distinctive feel of one of the poorer quality Sci-Fi channel Original movies. Made for TV all the way and a poor example of a made for TV fantasy pic to boot. The movie is a mess from beginning to end and it's the first movie in years where I've been so glad when it finally came to an end.With so much wrong with the movie, it really comes back to the director. The dialog and action were horribly directed and the framing of almost every shot was off in one way or the other. I began to imagine as the movie went along how a shot should have been framed, at what angles the action should have been filmed and how the shots should have transitioned. No, I'm not a film student or aspiring or arm chair director with jaded expectations, just a lover of movies who can discern competent direction from the amateur.The bare bones of an existing movie were there somewhere, but if any movie needed some major re-writes by some script doctor wunderkind, this was it.And a final mention for the horrible musical score. Uninspired at best, but at worst, on multiple occasions, the music was so inappropriate for what was happening on screen that I had to wonder if a non-musically inclined editor just slapped pieces of this and that randomly onto the soundtrack after their music budget came up short.Yes, this movie really is that bad. 1 1/2 stars, because I'm sure there are even worse movies out there some where.",0,0,0,0

R1J5WTGW3WUKYY,"I love the Mercy Thompson (Patricia Briggs) series and Kelley Armstrong, so I thought I'd enjoy this book. It has werewolves, an interesting twist - the whole 'latent wolf' thing - and strong (I thought) characters.Oh, how mistaken I was.As it turns out, Feral Sins is a mess of a book. I guess the author doesn't want her werewolves to actually, you know, act like wolves, because a) none of them use their sense of smell except at times it's convenient to the plot; and b) the whole dominant/submissive/alpha/pack rank dynamic doesn't seem to exist except, again, when convenient to the plot. The reader is told that Taryn can't change into a wolf, except at one point when it is mentioned that she can accomplish a partial shift. What exactly that entails is never explained, and she never seems to do it again after that point (not convenient to the plot). Though Trey is supposedly the Alpha of his pack, the other pack members constantly talk back to him, insult him and Taryn, and generally act like a-holes. And he doesn't do anything about it! Ever! It's ridiculous.Finally, the actual writing is... not good. Every character thinks and speaks in a similar way, certain words are used to excess ('petulant' being one example, 'perv' another), and they're all rude. Not sarcastic, not funny, just rude. Everyone in the book acts like an immature 15 year-old, despite being - supposedly - adults.I really do not understand how this book garnered over 300 5 star reviews.

On a flat, stable and level surface the 100g calibration weight is reported to weigh between 100.2 and 100.5g, i.e. it will report different weights for the same calibration weight.

So, if you are a tall person or sit somewhere where the height is above 20 inches, then you will be sitting in a hunched position.3) The mouse pad is just big enough for the mouse, not the mouse and my hand, just the mouse.

R3N7V7IYN8DCYL,"I don't doubt that there are readers out there who like this book.  But let's be real: this book gets no pub or positive reviews if the author is not 17.I appreciate the fact that Paolini seized his dream and wrote the book and I have no doubt that a lot of love and care went into it's writing.  However the author's age comes through in many ways both glaring and subtle.  When Tolkien wrote about beer and pipes in his fantasy you just knew that this was a guy who loved both.  And when you read biographies about him or the Inklings (the group of peers he hung out with) it's confirmed: he loved nothing more than to gather with good friends, drink a pint, smoke his pipe and talk.  When Paolini writes about pipes and beer (especially in regards to his Gandalf knock off) it reads exactly as if it was written by someone who had no real experience with either but felt he had to include them so that his work could be more legitimate.  It feels contrived rather than authentic and that's ultimately what separates great fiction from bad.  Tolkien's imagination teamed with the mythologies of ancient peoples; he grounded himself in those peoples' languages even while inventing his own.  That depth and experience shines through the pages of his work.  Paolini's work at this point feels by the numbers, as if he studied the forumlas of Tolkien and other great writers and then tried to overlay them onto his own work.Make no mistake: Paolini is a talented writer.  My hope is that all the adulation does not prevent him from developing his own set of experiences from which to draw on as he finds his voice.",0,0,0,0

Why GDT teamed up with this hack of a writer is beyond me.  I am surprised to see the other 5 star ratings on here.  How do you give that kind of a rating to an author who regularly writes half-sentences without a verb or subject?  Then we get to the rehashed vampire bits: Coffins filled with dirt, dangerous silver dirks, and a mix of the 1990s plague-movie genre.  If you want a good vampire story, read Interview With The Vampire by Anne Rice.  You won't find boring characters such as belabored luggage cart drivers at the airport, nor overworked CDC scientists who just want to spend time with their kids.",0,0,1,1

R2REMNVLZEPP39,"If you spend your $ solely based on the description of this printer, you are going to waste your $ 100%. First of all, my review is based on the equipments I use daily. I use 24 inch iMac from 2006 with Verizon Fios standard router. So, if one's using an Apple Extreme, the result may/may not vary. My network is always there with 2 iPhones, 1 iPad, and 2 Mac computers, and 1 Apple TV. Of course I have other wireless equipments that work flawlessly with Verizon network, however, every single time I press print from my iMac, it never delivers to the printer. I literally have to turn the printer on and off numerous times for a single page standard black and white print from this god forsaken printer. I used HP printers all my life and I have never gotten so frustrated with any other printer than this. My previous printer was an ethernet connection printer that worked faster even though the model was from 6 years ago.Dear HP, why do you have to screw up with this one? If firmware is the issue here, please fix this!!!",0,0,0,0
R3GA7JT7GGJ1FN,"The first clue as to how bad this was going to be was it is a Swedish inspector, filmed in Sweden by an all British cast.  How anyone can give this more than one star clearly makes me think I must be missing something as well as the few other people who gave it a one.  The first series jacket mentioned something about Branagh being brilliant in the role.  All I can say is lucky he is a great director and did a great job in Harry Potter.  The show is mostly non-dialogue.  There are long minutes of music, Wallander standing staring aimlessly into space, sitting staring into space, views of scenery with music, walking aimlessly none of which is worthwhile looking at.  The good news is you can fast forward through almost one hour out of the 1.5 hours since there is such little dialogue.  If you removed all of the above it would be a 30 minute show.This is supposed to be a take on some writer that has sold MILLIONS of Wallander books and is such a famous (like Sherlock Holms) they can barely keep it in stock.  Well, perhaps overseas.  This character is flat, unanimated, saying one dimensional would be even a stretch, kid and father treat him like garbage, appears to hate being a detective.What are the good points?  There are many famous great actors which I cannot understand why they would have been associated with this tripe.  A naturally blonde Tom Hiddleston is the only reason I made it this far since he is such a good actor.  Season three, not going to happen since I cannot bear how tedious this series is.",0,0,1,1

R3VJXNSCS3S3Y5,"That review headline was what I was yelling when I got to the page where Meg started cutting herself.  Like full-on emo kid cutting addition cutting.  Like, oh good, it's the urban fantasy glorifying cutting that no one needed.The maddening part is that it could be a good premise if the Human Liason job was more dangerous than it's described as, and every time Meg has near run-ins with death, she gets these compelling prophesies that string the plot along into more and more dangerous situations.  Instead I get a mail sorter with a cutting addiction.  Wrong direction with the story, Bishop.  I wanted dark fantasy.  Not a Lifetime movie.Also, the world building makes no sense.  Why would shifters with THAT much power tolerate the existence of human society?  I don't buy that they're just that enamored with glass beads and whatever else.  Beings with that much power would have either annihilated humans or kept them in breeding pens for meat, the same way we treat cattle.Not only that, but I'm really bothered that so many of Bishop's heroines are unrealistically mega-abused.  It almost worked in Daughter of the Blood because of the very different fantasy setting, but reading it in a world that's much like our own breaks down that suspension of disbelief for me.  Meg's experiences with the verbally abusive Simon and weird compound youth just isn't sitting well.I really don't understand the popularity of this series.  Different strokes, I guess.  I can say this: if you don't do well with cutting, gruesome murder being treated with a casual dark humor or mountains of abuse towards women, give it a pass.",0,0,0,0
R21HEZEFAA3VN6,"I'm not going to write a review of the film, it's been done by many people and I'm sure I could add nothing new.However for all you iTunes fans beware that if you purchase this film so you can download a digital copy from iTunes YOU CAN'T! The digital copy is from UltraViolet, linked with Flixster and to download it you have to create two new user accounts, both with different set-ps and passwords, which is really messy and trying to link the two accounts together is stupid (as you have to be logged out of one to connect to the other but it doesn't tell you this and you just keep getting a blank screen). Then, when you finally get everything sorted and are ready to download you have to install more software/apps onto your computer and after all this I can't watch it on my AppleTV (which it what I have digital copies for) and it can't sync (because it's not available in iTunes), according to UltraViolet Customer Support you can stream from iPhone 4S and iPad2 can stream to Apple TV using the AirPlay mirroring feature - which is all well and good if you have an iPhone 4S or iPad2, which I don't!So if you're thinking of buying this film for the digital copy (which is the only reason I bought it and I won't buy another film with a digital copy if the only option is UltraViolet!, I'll go straight to iTunes) then do some research and check out the many forums that are talking about this to decide if it's going to work for you.All that said, the film was what I expected (when I watched the BluRay) and I thoroughly enjoyed it.MY RATING IS FOR THE DIGITAL COPY NOT THE FILM",0,0,0,0

R2RXOXO8SGO2Z1,"I bought this hose a few years ago (2013) and have been very pleased with it.  After more than four years it is still in good shape.  The best part is that it is supple and easy to coil back up on the rack.I was so pleased with the hose I bought a second one a little over a year ago.  The second hose was a different color and much stiffer than the first. I used the feature on Amazon to ""order again"" and the part numbers are the same for the two hoses.  But the two hoses are not the same.  I usually don't do these reviews but I used that stiff hose again today and in the colder weather it is more trouble than it is worth to coil up.  The older hose on the front of the house is still as limber and flexible as it always is, but this second one is a nightmare and is headed for the trash.  I will have to cut the thing in short pieces to even get it in the garbage can.I don't know why I didn't send it back when I first got it.

R281DLDU6DIC33,"I don't normally write reviews, but this product was so awful that I felt it was my duty to inform others.  My wife is a teacher and we rely on our home printer quite regularly. We previously had the HP Officejet 8600 series (2 different printers, and printheads went bad on each both times), and although both had hardware failures, they at least performed their basic functions.  We wanted to stick with HP because we find the ink replenishment to be convenient.  When we saw the 8720, we thought it would be an upgrade, but we were terribly disappointed.This printer cannot print on cardstock.  The specifications clearly state it supports cardstock (up to 110 lb card), however, when we tried printing on 100 lb cardstock we stumbled upon 2 different issues;1.) it was unable to print on the 100 lb cardstock consistently.  The image or document you print will be off-center on the page, and this issue is amplified if you try to print more than 1 copy. The more copies you try to print, the further off-center the pages will print, resulting in significant loss of paper and ink.2.) it was unable to print duplex.  you are completely unable to print 2-sided with cardstock.  the printer would feed 1 page, flip, and then report a jam as it attempted to print on the second side of a sheet.This printer is vastly overpriced as it cannot manage even the most basic of functions including printing on cardstock, and printing duplex.

R8JNTJSGNC39S,"Here's an illustration of how bad this book is: while reading it, I used a page from a notebook as a bookmark. Every time I groaned, sniggered or rolled my eyes, I put a mark on the paper. The final tally? 149 marks. And I only started doing it about 1/3rd of the way in. That means that there were, at the very  least, 149 moments which were either stupid, lame or risible.Having read it, though, I have to disagree with those who claim Paolini's technical writing is incredibly bad. Eragon is at least serviceably written (meaning that I generally knew what was going on and who everyone is - it's not as simple as it seems to do that, you know), but I found it very tedious to read. There was not a single idea, character or line of dialogue in this book which appeared to be original, and that's the killer. It's true that most fantasy consists of reusing the same basic ideas over and over again (this is one of the appeals of fantasy for some people), but the mark of a good writer is that he or she always presents the popular cliches in a new and interesting way, or inserts a few ideas of his or her own.Paolini, however, for all the hype about how fresh and tasty his writing allegedly is, either has no imagination at all or is simply failing to use it. There was absolutely nothing original or surprising in Eragon; every plot point was predictable, the characters were all one-dimensional archetypes, and the world was yet another faux-medieval snorefest.I usually don't place too much emphasis on originality, and nor am I much of a nitpicker. But I expect books to be entertaining, and this one wasn't. It was just... lame.I never once found myself caring a toss about any of the the characters, and in the case of the main character I kept hoping that he would come to a horrible end. Which is odd, since a supposedly reliable reviewer wrote the comment inside the book which claimed that Eragon, the main character, was 'likeable'.I'm sorry, but I don't find this whiny, self-righteous deadbeat to be even slightly likeable. Eragon has no dark side and nothing interesting to say, and keeps ordering people around and snapping at them for no reason. That's not to say that he isn't believable: I'm able to say truthfully that I knew many people like him in highschool. Unfortunately, I hated every last one of them. In Eragon's case, I kept wanting to give him a slap upside the head.In summary, this book is not so much bad as just flat and mediocre. In addition, the magical powers with which Eragon is blessed come along just when they're most convenient, so that he never has to struggle to do anything. Giving this aggravating, unlikeable character mighty superpowers only makes him more annoying. Yes, I admire Paolini's acheivement, but I don't admire the revolting cynicism of his publishers, who have chosen to use the gimmick of his young age as a way to sell a sub-par book. But, of course, making lots of money is what publishing is all about, right?PS: Mericle; it would seem that, in fact, Paolini's parents DID own the publishing company. That would explain why the book says 'first published by Paolini Press' just inside the cover. Maybe I'm reading too much into that, but it just might mean something.",0,0,0,0
R3L7HH65UGD2KT,"Defiance: 4 out of 10: I have a soft spot for director Edward Zwick. I have a real soft spot for his Blood Diamond flick despite its pedestrian script and subconscious racism. In addition, The Last Samurai is another film of his that I loved despite its historical inaccuracies and bizarre lead casting. Defiance shares many of the same endemic faults that plagued those two films. I was not able to brush off the faults this time; I found them even more discordant as the film went on.Problem number one is Daniel Craig. He does not look like an Eastern Polish Jew. He looks like he misplaced his Oberstleutnant uniform at the Wehrmacht's cleaners. Even if you were able to accept Daniel Craig as some sort of Paul Newman style Jew who parachuted into Eastern Europe, only Helen Keller would buy him as Lev Schreiber's brother. A mutant dancing Australian with adamantium claws is a more believable brother for Schreiber than Craig is.In fact, Craig and Schreiber seem to be in two different films and Schreiber is in the much better one. Schreiber seems to be in the here and now with a strong subtle performance that is the best thing in the film. Daniel Craig's performance is as shaky as his accent. He, of course, is forced to do things like give Braveheart speeches from the back of a white horse, so the fault is hardly his alone. And saying platitudes such as 'Our vengeance is to live"" and ""Every day of freedom is like an act of faith"" while gazing at the camera with those, just give me an Oscar and I will go back to entertaining you, baby blues doesn't help his cause either.Problem number Two is best summarized by one of my favorite ladies:""I don't think we really need another film about the Holocaust, do we? It is like, how many have there been, you know. We get it. It was grim. Move on. No, I am doing it because I have noticed that if you do a film about the Holocaust you are guaranteed an Oscar ... That is why I am doing it. Schindler's bloody List. The Pianist. Oscars coming out of their arse.""' Kate Winslet (Winner of the 2008 Best Actress Oscar for Holocaust drama The Reader) in Extras, 2005Defiance is clearly Oscar bait. In one scene Daniel 'Moses' Craig leads his people through the reeds and swamps and away from the forest (and inexplicably away from decent cover and fortifications) until a Rabbi collapses, sputters out ""I almost lost my faith but you were sent by God to save us' and then promptly dies... oy vey. It really is not that easy to make a mainstream Holocaust film, release it in December, and get no nominations* for Golden Globes or Oscars. Defiance is clearly trying too hard.The third problem is that a third rate cast of Fiddler on the Roof somehow showed up lost in the woods. Somebody call the Jewish stereotype prison, cause there has been a mass escape. Everyone is here. The nebbish intellectual who cannot hammer a nail, the passive Jews who are unwilling to fight, the greedy Jew more interested in money than his fellow man. Good lord, it is as if Leni Reisenthal's travelling troop of clichés showed up. Thank goodness, Daniel Craig is here to straighten them all out and lead them to the Promised Land. Yup blond, blue eyed, Daniel Craig'. Yeah the movie has issues.*No nominations except, inexplicably, for its score; which at two hours of crying violins will test any ones nerves.",0,0,0,0

Really, about 450 pages is devoted from going one place to the next ala Dungeons and Dragons, sans anything exciting happening. The dialogue is poorly written. As script editor, I am always telling my writers to make their dialogue sound natural. After all, people tend to write more formally than they talk. This is a lesson that Christopher Paolini did not take the time to learn when he set out to write this.Both the narrative and the dialogue do get better when they finally reach the home of the Vardens, about 400 and some odd pages in. But it take a tremendous effort to get there, both on the part of the characters and the readers. Unfortunately, by this time, whenever he stops to describe something, you're too burned out by the reaaaaallllllyyyyyyy looooonnnnnggggg expositions that took place during the first 4/5th of the book and now you can't take any more.This book got a lot of good reviews. For the life of me, I can't understand why. On the other hand, it also got a lot of bad reviews. I'm in that camp. He hit on an interesting idea, but it was poorly executed.I am, however, going to read the next book in the series, Eldest. I hope it's going to be better.",0,0,0,0

R2B43Y6DZNDP4R,"Thanks to conscientious reviewers here speaking out about this book (and its sequels) for what it is: a wholesale literary con job.  I post this review in order to lend my voice to others raised in concern about this.  If ""Teachings of Don Juan"" had been offered honestly, as a novel, would it have been reviewed as a good one?  I doubt it, but we'll never know.  For it captured attention by claiming to be anthropology, nonfiction.  The circumstances and events recounted in its pages were supposedly true, and actually happened.  Or so we were told by its author and publisher.  For readers, THAT was the primary basis of interest in it.Back in the 1970's I read the first couple Don Juan books in a spirit of trust.  I accepted them as presented: ethnography, true or at least honest reports of anthropological field work.  Later I learned there was nothing truthful or honest in Castaneda's writing about ""Don Juan's teachings"" despite the misimpression perpetrated -- deliberately -- by the book's claim to nonfiction status.I was not pleased to find out my trust had been abused, that as a reader I'd been played like a violin as a reward for my interest.  ""It's your fault for having been interested, don't blame Castaneda"" -- is that the deal?  Doesn't life strip us of our innocence quickly enough in its own way, without being aided and abetted by con artists and their handiwork?  But looking around at comments here, seems there are other ways of looking at this ""sadder but wiser"" dilemma -- from all the glowing 5 star reviews and incoherent praise still heaped upon this book by some readers.Back when ""Teachings ..."" came out -- and still nowadays, to some extent -- the wilderness of mind had been dramatically revealed, for the first time in the history of our civilization, by personal experiences of many inquiring people with peyote, LSD, etc.  Consciousness-expansion opened upon a vast, compelling inner realm, hitherto unfamiliar and unexplored in Western culture (though long familiar in the East, where yoga and various forms of meditation have been intensively practiced for several millennia).  With their provocative intensity and vivid intimations of profound meaning, psychedelic experiences impelled many to seek out guidance, food for thought, answers to questions ages-old but newly realized; and difficult to even word clearly, much less discover answers to.  This was the atmosphere in which the Don Juan books were presented, and their effectiveness as bait to hook the unwary metaphysical seeker seems pretty clear.The search for some kind of spiritual, metaphysical or transcendent knowledge, truth or understanding -- sparked in many by direct personal psychedelic experiences -- expresses something acutely real and essential in the human equation.  It deserves to be treated with honesty and respect.  But obviously, it can also be exploited in a crass, reprehensible manner as a vulnerabilty or weakness by clever manipulators; whether they are the Elmer Gantry type (using old time religion) -- or psychedelic pied pipers surfing the waves of the new age.  It's unacceptable, and there can be no excuses, contrary to the unpersuasive, presumptuous attempts at justification offered by many.Thinly masked beneath a beguiling surface, the Don Juan books express values antithetical to personal growth or self-realization, authenticity, pursuit of truth, and humane regard for ourselves and others.  Castaneda's great contribution is a morally toxic perspective that we're all fools, and nothing matters, so there's no point in caring about anyone or anything except one's own self.  To heck with whoever or whatever, and yippee for each of us at everybody else's expense.  His writings are a Trojan horse, trickery disguised as a gift.The message is masked with a lot of verbal gobbledy-goop, Rorschach ink-blot nonsense readers are put upon to ascribe meaning to -- about being ""impeccable"" and ""a warrior's predilection"" and ... etc.  It goes on and on in a dense fog machinery.  He even makes up new nonsense meanings for words (like tonal, and nagual) he ripped from anthropo literature (where they actually have definitions referring to realities of Mexican lore and teachings).  But boiled down, his gist is we can be predators or prey, that's the choice we have.  Honesty, trying to relate, or seeking connection, that's for losers -- alienation and lies are what makes the world go around.  And it's exhilarating, liberating,  because it means we don't have to worry about anything, because we're all just gonna die sooner or later so -- whatever.  Yippee.As a con artist who got rich selling this snake oil medicine, Castaneda has become a towering inspiration of the worst kind to others.  A new generation has ""gotten it"" and followed suit, leading to a whole raft of similarly phony exploitative works pretending to be something else less despicable and more worthy or our interest and attention.For anyone interested, there is DeMille's book ""Don Juan Papers.""  Also, visit sustainedaction dot org -- an excellent website exploring the legacy and fallout of the Castaneda phenomenon.  It proves much darker and more disturbing than one might imagine; even if you already know the Don Juan books -- to this day still classified as nonfiction, presented as real life accounts -- were sheer fabrication, cleverly geared to deceive readers.",0,0,1,1
RS0C6O4OCB54K,"The cart took an extremely long time to assemble, due to every part needing to be put together, over 2 hours, plus some .

I always do step 1 then step 2-- but apparently I have twice not executed this correctly (perhaps my finger was covering something- there are details on the box about what not to do). I know it is my fault if I don't follow instructions on the box carefully, but I have never had to read instructions on any other printer cartridge installation for any of my other printers over the years for a successful cartridge install. Perhaps they can spend a few more minutes designing an ink cartridge that is more failproof for someone in a rush who simply needs to open the cartridge, pop it in, and go. I'm giving one star because the cartridge should be more failproof -- again, I have NEVER had cartridges explode from any other cartridge system, so that seems to me part my fault (yes) but part the fault of their design team. That said, I already own the printer so what choice do I have? I'll keep buying these cartridges because that's what I need for my current printer.

I am not going to get into the plot - because a few reviewers have posted it already - but I will go as far as saying that even though the story was interesting and it attracted me to read it - I was taken aback by the lack of character development and lack of poignancy, which I was hoping a story such as this should have had.The main characters were very lackluster and flat - almost wooden and stilted and lacking in vitality.  They had no chemistry and their attraction for each other didn't sizzle off the pages or left you panting waiting for their demise.... The secondary characters were for the most part ok - but the narrative got too wordy and the love scenes had no heart felt passion.Specially the lame-ass ending of who the killer is and their motives...

(Although it turns out the author did some very famous folks shepherding him, including the guy who wrote the Chinatown screenplay).  I found myself insisting my friends should read my copy as soon as I finished.But the longer the book went on, the less impressive it became; the writing, the plotting, and the characters were increasingly more predictable ...dare I say, more Hollywood-like?

RP6D0HSREVI4N,"After reading through volumes 1-4 and enjoying them immensely I was looking forward to volume 5. I'll begin with the good and go from there. The arts great. Its a wonderful blend of the moody, atmospheric art seen in previous volumes with distinctive enough edge so that the reader can easily tell whats going on without ruining the flow of the story (Something some of the previous issues had problems with).The story is its biggest flaw by far. A better writer could have condensed this story down to a single action packed issue and tacked it on to volume 4. It's not that the story's bad. It's that its stuck on the fence. I hate to compare different mediums but this feels like Moon Knights 'Spider-man 3'. Its crammed with characters that have zero development. It should have been made long enough to allow the characters to grow or even interact (specifically: Punisher and Toltec) or cut down enough to be used as a prologue in volume 4. As it is, volume 5 is in a no-mans land. It's just long enough to introduce or include a bevy of pointless characters to the plot but not long enough to develop them or even explain their motives.

RXYEJYM93EDCB,"If I could rate this a ZERO, I would.  I have a graduate degree in computer science and more than 40 years experience in computer imaging systems.  While this device is fast and the image quality is ""ok"" the programming and documentation are terrible.  There is a USB connection to power the device and allow you to copy files to your PC. However, it appears that the first images you scan get stored in internal memory.  After scanning about 200 slides, I copied them to my PC over the USB connection.  Next day I scanned another 200 slides and copied them over the USB connection as well -- or, rather, I thought I copied them.  Turns out it copied the first ~90 slides I scanned the day before (but had subsequently deleted from the memory card), probably copying them from internal memory, instead of copying the first ~90 slides I scanned that 2nd day, but also copied the remaining 110  files.  Stupid me didn't check every single slide but just the last few to be sure I got all of them.  I deleted those files from the SD card and repeated this process for 4 days, today being the 4th, when I discovered that nearly 400 of the 800 files I scanned were not present on my PC, but rather 4 copies of the first 90 slides I scanned, plus any additional slides I happened to scan on those days.  Fortunately, I copied each day's work to a separate directory, so I still have about 1/2 the files I scanned.  The bad news is the numbering overlaps so I can't just combine them into a directory without renaming every file.  I contacted DigitNow customer service to see how I could resent the starting number for the next batch of slides, but it cannot be changed!  This is the WORST programming I've ever encountered.

R1BCY8A45RW5MJ,"There is still a great deal of manual entry required.  The software, essentially, cannot read handwritten amounts.  Even if it's a machine-printed amount, it may not find the correct amount on the receipt.  It may, or may not, find the name of the issuer of the receipt.  In short, the user has to review EVERYTHING for accuracy, and do a lot of manual entry besides.  Furthermore, the ""upgrade"", I'd call it a ""sidegrade"", to version 5.1 is a hassle.  The new version of the software cannot directly read the previous backup file format (.nwbak), requiring a special migration process.

For the first few weeks I was happy with the overall functionality of the sign.  I like that is is oval and that the blue lights will create a movement to catch people's eye.  However, less than 2 months after purchasing the sign, it has malfunctioned.  The red lights do not stay consistently bright.  Sometimes the O and the P are dim while the E and N are bright.  Other times, the E and N are dim while the O and P are bright.  The chain that came with the light was not long enough for my situation, but I purchased a chain at a local hobby store that worked great.  Now, if the sign would just work properly, I would be happy.  Contacting the seller today to see what they are willing to do.  I will update this when I see what their response is.UPDATE 4/10/2015.  I was given a refund by Amazon for the 1st defective light, in late March.  Stupidly, I decided to give the light another chance, but from a different seller (as advised by Amazon).  The 2nd light, which was received from a different seller was received not working.  It also had 2 letters that would not light.  That seller sent me a replacement (making this my 3rd one!!!) and it was GREAT for a WEEK!!!  After just ONE WEEK,  the blue lights around the letters STOPPED WORKING!!!! I do NOT recommend this product!!! It should be BANNED FROM AMAZON!!!  Today, I had to file a complaint with Amazon due to the poor service of the company involved.

R32NHQBYT3GD5L,"Pure Manhood is pure fabrication. This is a sad case of a misguided man with questionably ""good"" intentions dispersing lies in hope of conforming our youth to unrealistic standards. I quote, ""any guy who relies on a condom for protection should meet a friend of mine who used a condom every single time and caused seven pregnancies"" (31). Yeah.. sure he did. In my opinion, Evert's crusade transgresses the principles set forth by the Bible, endorsing not only dishonesty but, in addition, viciously slandering homosexuals... and swimsuit magazines. In addition, the chapter where Evert condemns obese Americans to the death sentence was shocking; I myself suffer from morbid obesity. I enjoy long walks on the beach. I'm a lover and a fighter. I have a quick temper but I'm working to improve that. The thing about life is that there are more questions than answers. Sometimes I just look at the stars and wonder... why?

R1IDO9UYHVGVVX,"Dan Simmons needs an editor.  There is no reason this book should be pushing 600 pages.  Rambling, unfocused, and way too much bathroom humor for my tastes.  The book would make a great Hollywood movie, since Simmons seems unable to take on subject matter more complex than the standard disenfranchised sexually-fixated everyman facing massive physical and emotional exertion with typical sentimental overtones.  The quality metaphors that might make us care more about Ilium's plot and characters are lacking.  Padding its shortcomings with derivative material is another offensive element.  However, my only saving graces for having taken two weeks of free time to read Ilium is that I enjoyed the recitations of Shakespeare and Proust, and the Homer refresher was appreciated, but even that ultimately feels as empty as the banal film Troy, recently in theaters.  I wholeheartedly disagree with the overriding positive tone of the average reviewer toward this book, enough to inspire me to write my first Amazon review.",0,0,1,1
R2XELHQG0UXAX8,"I needed to laminate some white illustration board, which is wider than all the other lamination products I could find, except for this.  It looked very easy, it said it was easy... but it was not.  Like the others reviewing this product, I could not get the backing from even one sheet to remove properly.  I tried many times, but I could only get halfway across the width of the page before the backing split and started leaving paper behind on the plastic.It seems to me that Avery made a ton of this stuff using a poorly made backing paper that, after a short shelf-life, looses its ability to resist the adherence to the sticky.

In my opinion, don't take the risk.I have since found a product from Duck called Laminate Adhesive Peel N' Stick Shelf Liner (Clear) that I will try next.

R2XPUUPI11NGBA,"Got this as a 'gift' from my boss to use labeling stuff. He wasted his money on this. Looks like I'm the first person who isn't a Vine reviewer though.I've been working (fighting?) with this for about 2 weeks now. It worked OK when I had it hooked up via USB, but I wanted to use it as a wifi printer so it's out by the copy machine (about 12 feet from the primary AP antenna). It goes to sleep and won't reconnect to the wifi on demand, you have to turn it off and on to get the wifi to connect and the printer to show up on the program.The program. Oh, what a piece of junk the program is. Even if the printer is hooked up to the wifi (and I can see it on the DHCP client page), most of the time it won't show as connected in the program. Trying to create a label is a chore, too - it only inputs text horizontally even if you need it to be vertical. Label choices are hard coded into the system so you really can't do a custom label without jumping through all sorts of hoops. When it works, it works, but that's few and far between. Oh, and the printer has to have the name ""Leitz Icon"" or the program crashes when you try to print.Labels look OK when you can get it all figured out, but you're still limited on sizes. Even on a continuous roll like it comes with, you can't make a 1/2"" tall label - it claims the margins are too small. It won't operate as a true WYSIWYG label printer since it resizes text on the fly.Bottom Line: Don't buy this if you're expecting something that actually works. This will do its best to make you tear out your hair and gnash your teeth, all while laughing at how stupid you are since you can't print out the label even though your printer is definitely connected. Don't buy this if you want to use it on wifi only. Don't buy this unless you have money literally burning a hole in your pocket (like if it were covered in fluoric acid or something that you can't be exposed to).",0,0,0,0

R2N8JDHGTIZPS9,"**I received this book for free from the publisher or author in exchange for an honest review. This does not affect my opinion of the book or the content of my review.**THE LINE by JD Horn has all the elements that attract me to a book – southern gothic setting, witches, and dark family secrets that keep you guessing.  I really enjoyed the story’s premise and the details of its powerful world but there were certain elements that didn’t quite work for me.What I like about THE LINE has everything to do with its Savannah setting — hot sultry and southern – and its powerful world of witches.  In fact, the worldbuilding is really quite interesting.  Tucked underneath the southern gentility of Savannah’s historic setting, which Horn details wonderfully, is a world of witches that is literally maintaining the line that divides our world from that of the demons who once ruled it.  It’s this powerful line, a “safety net of energy,” that protects us humans from being ruled by our previous demon masters.  And it requires the talent of powerful witches who serve as anchors to maintain the line to protect the world.  Couple this with the actual powers of witches – telepathy, psychometry, etc – and THE LINE introduces the readers to a very compelling world filled with power, bickering witches, and a powerful witch family fighting to maintain control. Good stuff, right?What didn’t work so much for me are the characters themselves.  I found myself not really caring about any of them.  Take our heroine, Mercy.  She’s the only member born into the magically lustrous and powerful Taylor family who has no magic whatsoever.  She is referred to as “the disappointment.”  But Mercy is a kind soul.  She believes the best in people even if shown evidence to the contrary.  I just didn’t buy it.  Mercy is duped several times by people who are so obviously not who they seem that I could not understand her utter naivete.  Mercy is also inexplicably in love with her twin sister’s fiancée.  Other than the fact that he’s hot, there seemed to be no solid reason behind this love other than the physical.  It seemed more of a plot device to add more tension and provide rationale for certain aspects of the story.  In the end, the infatuation felt superficial and wholly unbelievable.  Finally, the entire Taylor family came across as entitled, magically powerful snobs.  Don’t get me wrong. I don’t have to like a character to think a book is good.  Not everyone is likeable.  But I found myself oddly uncaring about the fates of any of these characters.The one character I was interested in was Mother Jilo.  But I felt she was firmly placed in the stereotypical, mystical African American hoodoo woman — evil and untrustworthy, with stolen magic and an amateur knowledge of it.  She proves to be not what she seems which redeems her characterization, to certain degree, though this shift in how we view her is told to us and not shown.  I hope in future books more nuance is given to her character.There was a nice build up to solving a murder mystery and identifying the next Taylor witch to become an anchor.  But the end felt a bit anticlimactic.  A ceremony happens, stuff goes down, there’s a twist I see a mile away (yet, unsurprisingly, Mercy doesn’t) and then it’s over.  Though an interesting set-up for the next book, I wish the nice tension of a murder and the power grab for the anchor position, had been translated into an equally tense ending.THE LINE has a fantastic world and a solid premise.  Had the characters been equally as compelling, this could have been one of my favorite reads.  I see a lot of promise in this new series but I’m split down the middle on this one...2.5 stars.",0,0,0,0

R1UJC3VWVHCRR4,"I saw ""Daredevil"" on opening day, against my better judgement.  I had read the scathing reviews in the Boston Globe and Entertainment Weekly, but I was willing to give it a shot.  I mean, it's Ben Affleck in leather...However, I was ultimately disappointed.  Not because of what the Globe and EW had mentioned but for other reasons.  Ben Affleck plays the tormented Matt Murdock, a blind lawyer (who somehow subsists on only pro bono work) out for venegance as his alterego Daredevil.  Ever since he witnessed the death of his father as a child, he is on a serious rage streak (oddly reminiscent of his character in ""Changing Lanes""), and he is out for blood against the city's evil-doers.  However, his superhero status is not so black hat vs. white hat.  In fact, at several points in the movie, he questions if his vengeance is actually making him a bad guy as well.  Very interesting, right?Well, let me just say here that these attempts to make Murdock interesting just make the Ben Affleck even less effective in this role.  He just lacks the sincerity to pull off the tormented superhero.  In addition, the way the story is written doesn't establish any of the characters very well to begin with.This is especially true of Elektra Natchios, played by the svelte Jennifer Garner.  I admit, she has a great physique and killer moves, but her character just seems like a fluffy side-story.  For some reason, she has been raised as some sort of Amazon martial arts warrior woman.  But why?  ""My father never wanted me to be a victim.""  OK, MY dad doesn't want me to be a victim either.  Doesn't mean they'd have sent me to army training maneuvers over Camp Horizons.However, the movie wasn't ALL bad.  Colin Farrell makes a comical but deadly foil as Bullseye, and Daredevil's arch-nemesis Kingpin (played by Michael Clarke Duncan) is sufficiently evil as the criminal mastermind of the city.  The action sequences are good as well.So, to sum it up, Daredevil is all action, no talk.  The characters are poorly developed, and you just can't get very interested in them.",0,0,0,0

R202VJ4VQC378R,"Dune: House Atreides is the first in the expansions to the Dune legacy created by Frank Herbert, this novel is set approximately 45 years prior to the first Dune novel written in 1963. Written by Brian Herbert, the son of the author of Dune, with co-writer Kevin J. Anderson, the duo has huge footsteps in which to follow. The novel takes us through the lives of the young Leto Atreides the man who would soon be Duke Leto and father to Muad'Dib, Duncan Idaho and his escape from the Harkonnen slave pits, Baron Harkonnen's early dealings with the planet Arrakis and his subsequent siring of Lady Jessica, Shaddam Corrino and his ascendancy to the emperor's throne with the help of childhood friend Hasmir Fenring, Thufir Hawat, and the original planetologist assigned to Arrakis by the Emperor Elrood, Pardo Kynes.Now if that looks like a mouthful, even to a seasoned Dune fanatic, wait till you try to chew on all of the additional characters that these key players meet and interact with. It's enough to make your head spin. When you mash all of these plotlines together into one novel like this (and the first in a trilogy, so you know that the next two will be more of the same characters and certainly an equal number of new characters) you are left with a meal consisting of delicately sipping a vintage wine in between bites of chili-cheese fries. The chapters get shorter and shorter as the book progresses and end up more akin to a few frames of an after-school cartoon rather than something worth reading, pondering, digesting, and perhaps re-reading again someday. Nope. One read through on this book and you will probably need to brush your teeth just to get the bad taste out of your mouth.The entire Pardo Kynes story simply does not belong in this novel. It is little more than a fleshed out version of Appendix One from Dune, and Frank Herbert wrote a more compelling version in 6 or 7 pages than son Herbert and co-writer Anderson do with a dozen chapters. Pluck this plotline out of this book altogether and make it a smaller, separate book of its own. It's presence here shows us how little these two really know about storytelling.For those of us who have been Dune fanatics for any portion of the past 3-1/2 decades, we get to look forward do at least one major Duniverse error in each of these chapters, whether from the Baron's lean, muscular physique, to Duncan Idaho's curiously missing sister and absence of slave pits, to just about everyone and his brother being acquainted with the Bene Gesserit's breeding programs. Gone is the mystery of the Bene Gesserit, the origins of spice, and the inner workings of Ix. We even have Vladimir Harkonnen's suggested inclination toward boy sex toys (from Dune and Children of Dune) clearly laid out as no-holds-barred homosexuality. Makes you wonder how he is going to become the father of the future Jessica Atreides, hmmm? Well, never fear, but our wonderful Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohaim will find herself the future mother of Jessica through a surprising tryst with the Baron. OMG! Where did these boys miss the repeated references in the Dune chronicles to the multiple bastard children the Baron had by his reckless youthful adventures? The son Herbert insists that upon reading his father's notes, though, that the Baron is gay (not maybe even a little bi) and is forced to father this child (and another!) through a few weak plot points and manipulations. Wow! The imaginations of a pair of writers is limited by their extreme belief in polarities and simplicities. Every nuance is good/bad, straight/gay, obviously planned out and panned out.Every attempt at complexity can't escape the suffocating breath of complicated and contrived. If the reader wanted to scrutinize the text piece by piece, consider such timeless phrases as ""by the saints and sinners"" or ""the work of Satan"" or how about ""stronger than adamantium."" What, is this suddenly an X-Men novel?The inherent problem with any prequel, as clearly visible in the Star Wars prequels, is how to make use of the information that already exists in the later novels, and enhance it in the prequels, while not spelling out the details of what were surprises in the original series. If we know that Jessica is Baron Harkonnen's child, then where is the surprise upon reading Frank Herbert's Dune that the Baron is Paul's grandfather?Another problem with prequels, especially with decades between the actual writing of them, is to be careful not to introduce technology or advancements that would be inexplicably absent in the later novels or would give people an undue advantage if they were so readily available. Let's call into question these strange earplugs that Baron Harkonnen uses to make himself impervious to the Voice? You would think by the time of Dune, in relation to this book, that everyone in court would have such earplugs to avoid manipulation by the Bene Gesserit. Of course what follows is sure to upset the Bene Gesserit fans: A Reverend Mother is stunned by the future equivalent of a tazer and then she is raped! Let's not even consider that some strange disappearing no-ship technology wanders into the Baron's hands. This would become real useful to wipe out a pesky Duke who took over Arrakis. Come on! Reality check!This book feels more like a color by numbers painting that a child could easily do, rather than a complex and intriguing work of art. The authors are trying to connect too many dots into one story, and they are winking at the readers repeatedly as they try to be clever with tying in as many Dune themes as possible, even themes that will not resurface for 4500 years in Heretics of Dune or Chapterhouse Dune, or more frighteningly, in the ever-present Dune 7 and 8 looming on the horizon...This reader is afraid to continue on to the next book, House Harkonnen...",0,0,0,0

RRYXVRN3WEY7Z,"I should have listened to the reviews and steered clear of these but of course I had to learn everything else in life the hard way so it’s only fitting that be the case with these as well.To begin with, I opened the case to find pens with all sorts of different amounts of ink levels which is always a red flag but was especially concerning and disappointing because some were nearly empty and I do mean empty. I have emptied enough gel pens to know that this isn’t something that happens easily or by accident. Maybe if the pen was nearly empty AND there was a bunch of ink leaked all in the cap and case but that’s not at all what went on with my set. The cap and the case were both clean. The different various ink levels along with the fact that when I emailed the seller and requested a replacement set and was instead given a refund and told that there were no more sets tells me that I almost certainly received a used set that had been returned after quite a bit of use.I assume the reason it was returned was not due to the levels of ink though. I imagine that the original owner received a pretty even batch and that the ink amount changed as they used the pens. The reason I imagine they probably returned these was because, quite frankly, they aren’t very good pens. I could be wrong because I got a used set and maybe the previous owner left the caps off or something but all of the pens were mostly dry and barely flowed. The ones that did flow would skip a lot and were frustratingly unreliable. To top it off the colors were not very vibrant or anything special. The ink did dry quickly, I will give it that. Also there is a good variety of textures as this set has neon, metallic, and glitter. Out of the entire set I really liked the color of four of them and of those four, two were dried up, one was empty and the other worked.These pens are so thin that I can’t imagine getting much use out of them for coloring anyway even if they did work. They barely contain much ink at all. I definitely really liked the feel of the skinnier pens in my hand though as I have pretty tiny hands though so that may be why. The difference in feel though does not outweigh the negatives however and I’d take a fatter pen between my fingers for longer lasting, reliable ink flow, cheaper price, and better color selection any day. The case was nice and hard and latched solidly and I thought that was a great change from the usual folding, cheap, annoying, plastic things that most gel pens come in but unfortunately the pens were super hard to get out of it and I felt like I was going to snap a pen in half trying to get it out or put it in.Bottom line: Do not buy these! Look elsewhere on Amazon because they have some amazing sets with 100 beautiful colors, comfort grips, perfect flow, and refills for almost half of what these cost. Check out Aen, ColorTechnik, Amazapens, and GelWriters right here on Amazon for some high quality and reliable gel pens!",0,0,0,0

R1Q34FZTL13VFD,"I had previously heard great things about this movie. I had everyone telling me how great the characters were and how great the action was. I decided to check it out. I was seriously dissapointed. First off I knew quite soon into the movie that it was going to be irritating watching this camera move around. I decided to let it slip by me and watch it. The movie than presents your average stereotypical cast which includes the strong hearted and strong willed women, the tough male leader, the confused kids, the ""kill-off"" extra members of the group, and the strange alien character who assists our heroes. This movie is plagued entirely by uninspired acting and you never really get a chance to enjoy each of the characters. The alien creatures were a great idea but you were never really presented with a chance to awe at them as they were avoided much of the time. What keeps it from 1 star is the main character was wonderfully portrayed and acted giving him an eerie sense about him but he was probbaly the only character that interested anyone. Rent it if you are seriously into sci-fi flicks but the casual movie viewer should avoid it like the plague.",0,0,0,0

The Printer indicated 60% fuser life left when it failed.  So I bought another, thinking I just had bad luck with this one.  Second  printer has the same issue after 52% fuser life left.

I agree with his damning assesment of civilisation but I am not sure his mostly vague thoughts about new tribalism is really much of a solution to anyone.

R24HKSEN9SWF1L,"Booo.  I was so disappointed that this cart was such a bust.  I live in a historic neighborhood, one that comes with mature tree roots wreaking havoc on the streets and sidewalks.  I made it the 1/2 mile to the grocery without issue.  I was pretty annoyed that the back wheels don't swivel, making it impossible to turn the cart when pushing it through the grocery store like a traditional shopping cart.  Because of the bad reviews I read about weight and making sure the bottom doesn't bow, I was minding my list of veggies, a few dry goods and 1 gallon of drinking water.  All was well and I headed out of the store.  No bowing, no squeaks.  Nothing to show any signs of stress.  I walked on the street for part of the way as the sidewalk is pretty non-existent because of the tree roots with makeshift ""bridges"" and I wasn't going to test it.  Once I got to a place that I could move safely onto the sidewalk I hit a small pothole and SNAP.  The entire middle plastic part of the wheel snapped right off.  There I was, standing there with my sad, broken-down old lady cart.  i had to call my husband to have him come pick me and our groceries up - which he was none to pleased with since it was football Sunday and he had regaled himself to the man-cave and determined to not wear pants for the entire day.

Literally 200 pages before the two main characters met more than for a moment where they both saw each other in the aftermath of the initial starting tragedy. I wish I was exaggerating, but I doublechecked the page count when I got ready to post this review.The other issue was that there was no surprise or mystery really AT ALL. We knew the identity (and had a ton of time in their POV) almost from the start, and said baddie was not remotely relatable, and the more we spent time in their POV, the more I wanted to just toss the book away.Once the romance finally got going, it was a little easier to read, and as always I did love the way Nora wrote the family relationships and CeCe was a delight.

First, the book does not provide any new information on the causes of the crisis and it reads as if the authors are late to the game and trying to make up for it.  The issues surrounding the GSEs and mortgage securitization are well documented and honestly i think there are probably 10 better books out there.  Not terribly thought provoking i know but i do want to point out that i think the authors of this book were extremely biased in thier account.  Half the book is quotes from democrats in congress and the Clinton administration about the mistakes they made in supporting Fannie and Freddie.  It seems to be only a footnote that Bush was in office for the 8 years leading up to the crisis, half of which with a republican congress.  In addition, the authors come off as being angry and not terribly thoughtful.  For instance, the line ""All they needed to do was get Kerry into the White House and all of Fannie's probems would disappear"".  Really? That is clearly a biased editorial comment without any merit and clearly not based on any facts.  The entire book reads like the above.

For people to have had interest in the comic book (therefore inspiring a movie), it would have had an interesting and believable storyline. The movie should follow the same standards. There ARE good comic book movies with plots that aren't easily criticized. This movie is not one of them.Second, if all you care about is action and special effects, why don't you just take the best of The Matrix, Lord of the Rings, Spider-Man, Fast and the Furious, Pirates of the Caribbean and any other movie you worship, mash all of the action scenes together, and watch it? At least then you wouldn't have to think about a plot. That's what you're getting at, right?Finally, just because you liked the movie and I didn't doesn't mean it justifies a negative, unhelpful vote. I appreciate a good debate and constructive criticism, so leave me a comment if you think I'm out of line with my review. I'd love for you to tell me what I can do to improve my review.----I remember when ""Wanted"" was in theaters. My boyfriend had an initial interest in seeing it but after several weeks, he forgot about it... Until the DVD release date came around! Never one to miss a DVD release, he picked it up and we had a movie night with ""Wanted.""What I ""wanted"" to do was roll my eyes. If you've seen any Angelina Jolie action movie (Tomb Raider, Mr. and Mrs. Smith), you've seen this movie. It's a lot of cold-faced staring, squinty-eyed scowling, puffed-out pouting and dramatic pew-pewing. I suppose for some people, Angelina Jolie is reason enough to watch a film!The movie started out convincingly enough, with anxiety-prone loser Wes (McAvoy) giving us a glimpse of his mundane life. Soon enough, Fox (Jolie) steps in to recruit the spastic twenty-something to The Fraternity, an age-old clan of assassins trained to bend time and defy the laws of physics. The point: to avenge his late father, who possessed the same abilities his son would soon learn about.I'll give it to them - the special effects, the chase scenes and the series of events leading viewers through Wes' training was pretty amazing. But it's nothing you haven't seen before - a la ""Matrix."" However, when they mentioned Wes' room was his father's, the commentary and hilarity following that scene never ended. ""I knew at that moment I had to train harder than ever before, know every move he ever made, etc. etc..."" It was over for me.After that, the movie was about as cliched as can be. Token gunfights, a betrayal, hot naked lady scene, and a not so surprising ""twist"" at the end. SPOILER: The ""villain,"" as his life is about to end, tells the protagonist Wes, that he is actually his father. Oh dear. First off, didn't see that coming (wink). Second, if you've chased a guy through God's creation, to hell and back, what are the odds that you're actually going to believe him?Unfortunately, the movie's only good for eye candy and nothing more. My suggestion: borrow it from someone, enjoy the action shots (and let's not forget the Angelina), and pat yourself on the back for not wasting nearly two hours of your life.Alternatively, my boyfriend thought it was ""awesome."" Of course, that's what demographic this movie ""Wanted."" Go figure!",0,0,0,0

R3IA5WFFGK2E13,"I'm being generous with my 2 star rating.  If it wasn't a WWII movie, which I'm partial to, and for the fact that I have seen worse, I'd have scored it lower.I've watched this movie several times and it has always disturbed me. Today it got to me so much that I had to turn it off and find something else.What is disturbing is the Hollywood interpretation of what jungle warfare was like and what military protocol is like.In the opening scenes we have the unit commander chewing out the sergeant for talking back and questioning the orders.  Then the rest of the movie is about the sergeant's detail - all bickering with him and questioning his decisions and his ability to lead.Skip Homeier does his job really well in this movie, but that is really his stock in trade.  Even in the cowboy movies, his role was usually the junior player with the whinning, complaining, bickering personality.Even Toni Curtis gets in on the ""challenge-the-Sarge-at-every-turn"" campaign which is or eventually became ""Out of Character"" for him.But the rub is that this sort of insubordination was not tolerated in the military.  If anyone had tried this pull this sort of malarky and survived the ordeal, they would have been put up for courts martial as soon as they returned.But Hollywood needs to develop tension in a movie.  Tension and release, tension and release, over and over is what allows the plot to build and climax.  When the tension is real, like honest fear, hardship, tragedy etc, it works well, but in the abscense of any real anxiety or stress, script writers try to manufacter it with this childish bickering.  THAT is the mark of a substandard plot/story.  I have seen it work in some films but only because the director knew how to handle it and keep it at a minimum.  In this film it is done not only to excess but almost as a replacement for any real plot development.When the squabbles become tired and worn out, introduce new characters and begin new altercations.Honestly, in this film, there is more fighting amongst themselves than there is with the enemy.  That is tiring to watch.",0,0,0,0

R1UYVQR5XSIJ5F,"This copy of Fitzgerald's masterpiece is genuinely offensive to anyone who enjoys legitimate printed editions of novels. Further than that, in fact, its offense goes so far as to include those who may find cheap print shop replicas of books acceptable, but who also require the text to be formatted as the original publisher and author intended. The image on the front cover is of such low quality that the individual pixels are visible even without close inspection; the cover title is formatted so poorly that it is actually cut by the binding. As the image shows, the formatting and font choice suggests a private print-shop job, which is so poor as to actually ruin the experience of reading the beautiful prose contained within it.

R58VLN8LKPJWT,"I have this really thick eyeliner pencil (Tarte SmolderEYES).  None of my regular sharpeners were big enough to handle it, and I really like the color, but it was getting to the point where I couldn't use it any longer.  I didn't want to pay for shipping from Tarte so I bought this.Well.  This mangled the end of my eyeliner pencil.  It didn't trim the wood part evenly and it completely crushed/smashed the eyeliner inside.  I lost probably a half inch of product trying to get this to work.  I held it in both hands, trying to see where I'd have better control of the pencil.  I held the pencil as straight as possible inside the hole.I think part of the problem was the blade was not sharp enough for this particular pencil (for which the wood part is fairly hard, to be sure).  At any rate, the smashing of the eyeliner part of the product all over the inside made the blade hard to clean, too.This *may* still work for pencils even larger than the Tarte SmolderEYES, where they can't wiggle around as much in the hole while you sharpen them.  It also may work for sharpening products that aren't as hard on the outside, and for products where the actual makeup part is firmer than with the Tarte product I was attempting to sharpen.  (I ended up buying the Tarte sharpener for two bucks.  Live and learn, I guess.)

R1JO1JLPLA1Y73,"Though this is a well-written book, it was clearly written for heterosexual women and about their unique concerns related to re-entering the dating scene. If you happen to be male, gay, lesbian or transgendered, you are invited to look elsewhere for help.Like all dummies books, this book attempts to cover a very complex subject in everyday language. Browne deals with social media and online dating as well as learning to interact with the other person. There are several very nice sections on the importance of sex and intimacy. Those parts of the book are excellent and well worth your time.I do highly recommend this book, but if you are not in the targeted audience of ""straight"" or female, prepare to feel left out from very early on in the book. I don't understand why Browne only wants to talk to ""straight"" people, but I think it might be religious. To Browne, gays and bisexuals are selfish relationship wreckers. The readers are plainly warned about the pitfalls of knowing such persons (Dr. Browne calls them ""homosexuals"" or ""gay people"" as though they are animals in a zoo).

Hundreds of pages float idly by where nothing much of interest happens, interspersed with battles completely devoid of tension that devolve into Arlen or Jardir, depending on the locale, using their newly discovered super duper powers to save the day. Of course, when the book is about to make progress towards something interesting it ends. A very disappointing addition to a formerly well regarded series.

R1PCMGJVMOT0QA,"***********UPDATE*********** - 3 months later, I would give this NEGATIVE 5 stars.- There is no more resistance to keep the tray elevated.- Likewise no resistance to keep tray from swiveling - which results in table becoming off balance and even falling.- The wheels don't swivel well, so pushing it on hardwood just scrapes the floor. (which contributes to the risk of table falling over)- 2 of the wheel 'locks' have broken off.Really - BUY SOMETHING ELSE. I just can't believe anyone would rate this positively.***********Original review***********I don't get why anyone would give this 5 stars. Maybe they've never seen another rolling laptop table like this ever before. If I could give this a 0, I would. Heck, I'd give it a negative 5 if I could. I've never been more disappointed after opening a box... Where do I start.1) All of the ""hardware"" that holds this together and allows you to ""adjust"" it are made of relatively flimsy plastic. I doubt they can bare much weight. If you use this often and leave you computer on it so the time, I'm quite sure it will break.2) Even the metal fasteners are extremely cheap steel. You can't buy this low quality in a hardware store in the US. The screws and nuts are easily capable of de-threading each other. If you hold out a screw and wrap the thread with a screwdriver, you will dent it and it will no longer be fully useable (well, for this table you might because half of it is plastic). To dent threads on a discount store, discount screw, you typically need to hammer a screwdriver or chisel into it. Like I said, you can't buy this low strength alloy in North America.3) The casters, like everything else, are small, flimsy and all plastic. The ""locks"" as they call them have no real mechanism to hold them in ""locked"" position. When I locked and unlocked one about 20 times in a row, it ceased to be about to prevent the wheel from turning.4) Nothing can be securely fastened. Every piece has some wiggly and give to it. I'm good with my hands and have expertly assembled countless pieces of furniture and mechanical pieces. I assembled this table as perfectly as can be done. Wiggle wobble every piece every direction.5) It's MUCH smaller than it seems in the pictures. Especially the misleading image that shows 23.6"" measurement for the main tray. That's the length across both trays at the middle where it's rounded. The actual width you have for your laptop is just under 15""I will update this review when it breaks and becomes unusable. I expect that to be in less than 3 months. If it's still alive in 3-4 months and proves any bit of my original assessment wrong, I'll share that as well.Until then, there's no reason on Earth to buy this. There are similarly priced tables all over Amazon. Even if they are horrible, they can't be any worse than this.",0,0,1,1
RSG73L3NFUXWQ,"This review was inspired by and is dedicated to my friend Lee. I hate you for this, good buddy.I want to start by saying that I love Wes Craven. I have since I was a child. I know that the immediate image that pops into most people's head is his most prolific creation, he of the razor claws and even sharper tongue, but my love for him spans almost two decades of film. My usual Friday night activity was going to the video store, and renting as many one dollar horror movies as I could, and spending every night of the weekend immersing myself in them. Many of these were Wes Craven films, many I watched multiple times, and many I still watch today. I want that remembered for what I'm about to do.Jimmy (Jesse Eisenberg) and his sister Ellie (Christina Ricci) are driving home one night when an animal crashes into them, causing then to crash into Becky (Shannon Elizabeth), whose car goes over the embankment, and flips onto it's hood. After Jimmy frees her from the seatbelt, a large animal pulls her out of the window, and pulls all three of them through the woods. Becky dies, but Jimmy and Ellie survive with scratches. The following day, both of them begin to notice changes happening to them, such as increased strength and sexuality, and the fact that his dog won't come near him. Meanwhile, Ellie is dealing with her new boyfriends (Played by Joshua Jackson...That's right. Pacey from Dawson's Creek) past romances, which apparently include every woman in California, and he can't seem to understand why she's upset everytime 37 women show up and start flirting with him, and Jimmy uses his new found strength to join the wrestling team and beat up the bullies at school that show up everytime he starts talking to his crush, and call him many different variations of gay. Once they realize that the werewolf is still chasing them, it turns into the world's biggest cliche to find out who the werewolf is.I usually try not to list any spoilers, but in this case, I don't care. I don't want you to watch this movie, so I'm going to list all of the things I hate about it.1. I know a big named cast worked for Wes in Scream, and here he basically tries to repeat that. It doesn't work...at all. For a prime example, try saying Jessie Eisenberg and increased sexuality in the same sentence. See how stupid that sounds? That's how stupid this movie is.As far as Christina Ricci,  she let's her hair down. Now she's so hot all of the guys she walks by notices her, even though she's walked by them before.2. When Jimmy decides to join the wrestling team to confront his tormentors, it's much less Teen Wolf, and much more Spider-Man. He's doing professional wrestling moves that no coach would ever allow, and the coaches just stand by with dumb, amazed looks on their faces.3. When Jimmy dog bites him, he then becomes infected. When the beast finally comes out in the dog, we are treated to the stupidest CGI werewolf/dog hybrid ever. Seriously, a high school student with a laptop could have done a better job.4. An hour into the movie, we learn that everyone is a werewolf. Jimmy, Ellie, Ellies boyfriend, and Scott Baios publicist, who is the token bitch(Hahaha, my play on words), that nobody likes. You may now be asking yourself why Scott Baio is there, but instead of giving you a long winded answer, I'm just going to say because why not. At this point, what the hell?5. Remember how stupid the Weredog looked? Turns out the Werewolf looks just as stupid. Even better is the transformation, which is almost painful to watch. It would seem they used the special effects budget on securing Scott Baio.6. Once Jimmy wins the wresting match, the main bully shows up at his house, and admits that he is secretly gay, and Jimmy is the only one that ever figured it out. After a super awkward attempted kiss, they are best friends. Not only is this lazy storytelling, I would think it would he offensive to gay people. The entire first half of the movie is filled with anti-gay slurs, but it's cool, it's only to disguise someone's embarrassment about being gay.7. It turns out that Ellies boyfriend has been a werewolf since birth, but he gave the curse to the publicist after a night of unprotected sex. She attacked Ellie, and by random chance Jimmy, because he rejected her, and started dating Ellie. She actually says during the fight scene ""If I can't have him, neither can you"". So the whole movie boils down to a jealous female who didn't get what she wanted, so she's acting out.I could keep going, but I don't even care anymore.Scare Factor 1/10 This movie is billed as a horror comedy, but it's neither scary nor funny. It fails on every level at every thing that it attempts to do. It is bland and pointless, and there is no redeeming quality to it.Gore 1/10 Yep...a Werewolf movie with a minimal amount of blood. Like a scrapped knee level of blood. No blood.Recommended 1/10 I hate this movie. It's insulting, moronic, and is complete garbage. The ending features Ellies boyfriend, who for the entire movie has just wanted to love her, suddenly changing pace, and deciding he should kill her brother. This is so they have a reason to team up, and kill him, the main Werewolf, and break the curse, and secure a happy fairy tale ending. Then Jimmys crush approaches with his now cured dog, and his ex bully/new best friend, and they walk off into the sunset. I have literally had better nightmares. There are children's movies with more depth than this. It's not even good to watch with a group of friends, so you can all make fun of it. This movie is to film as cancer is to awesome. That doesn't even make sense, and neither does this ridiculous excuse of a movie.As a side note, and I might be over reacting, but I would like to address a personal insult from movies of this nature. I know beautiful people help sell movies, and Hollywood has certain expectations, but it is insulting to load a horror movie with actors that that have no business being in it. Dedicated horror fans, statistically speaking,  are outsiders, and not the Uber popular kids. We are the ones sitting in the stairwells reading during lunch, because we're too weird to sit with any of the social groups. By not only loading a ""horror"" movie with nothing but people that wouldn't have talked to us in high school, but having everyone in the film playing some kind of horror genius,  ( Examples include Ellies boyfriend owning a all horror themed nightclub, Jimmys school library having a vast assortment on books regarding lycanthropy,  and Jimmy himself having a massive amount of horror comics and paraphernalia), it shows absolutely zero respect for the people that have dedicated their lives to loving all things horror. I might be the only one that feels this way, but it is a slap in the face.Furthermore,  you cannot just take any actor, and toss them in a horror film, and expect good results. It requires talents that other genres of movie do not, just as those genres require talents that you might not find in a horror icon.You don't put Kane Hodder in a romantic period piece. It would be absurd.Jeffrey Combs in a romantic comedy. Nope, it would never happen.Sid Haig in a moving drama about over coming adversity due to racial profiling. Not a chance...That's because these guys are horror actors, and what they do is very unique and part of the charm of the entire genre.Please stop ruining movies by throwing A-list actors in there that don't appreciate horror, and just see it as another role. They might not care, but we, the fans, do.",0,0,0,0

It was definitely too drawn out, but that was the least of the criticism.  (spoiler alert)The main character, who was supposedly so smart, kept finding herself in harms way (i.e., constantly being raped), yet it never affected her mental state -- she actually started enjoying it! What an insult to anyone who ever experienced that sort of violence. The author spent too much time reporting dates and times of battles, and spent too little time making sure the actual story made any sense.  I don't expect a lot of reality to historical romances, but seriously this one was more fantasy than 50 Shades of Grey!

R291BSHCTH6DL,"[NOTE: This review has been rewritten on February 17th, 2010.]Where do I begin?Well, a few years ago, I made a visit to the bookstore. While I was there, I came across a paperback edition of Christopher Paolini's critically-acclaimed Eragon, which is the first installment of The Inheritance Cycle. I always heard about the praise which was given to both the book and the author, and how he wrote this book starting at the age of fifteen, and so on. I gave it a try; I picked it up and immediately read the Prologue & the first two chapters. What I got from it was mild frustration. The chapters reminded me of the introduction to Star Wars: A New Hope. I guess I forgot to tell you that not only did I hear praise, but criticism as well. Many people have lambasted this book for copying Star Wars and Lord of the Rings, and I couldn't help but be reminded of that exact criticism. I quickly put Eragon back on the shelf, and I continued on in the bookstore. Cut to February of 2010, when I find myself interested in Eragon once again, but in a different way. I wanted to see how it really fared out. Is it really bad as some critics say? Is it really good? Is it just average? I didn't purchase it, however; I borrowed a hardcover edition from the library. And this, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, this became the beginning of a dismal journey. Oh, the torture!Now, like millions of people worldwide, I am an avid reader. I can read anything from fantasy epics, political thrillers, non-fiction, Shakespeare, etc. From Don Quixote to Empire Falls to even Percy Jackson & the Olympians, I have enjoyed reading almost every book that I have ever touched. All but Eragon, and a few others. Honestly, I don't think I have ever read a book as awful as Eragon. I didn't find myself fully immersed in the story. I didn't find myself caring for the characters. I didn't find the writing extraordinary or inspirational. I didn't even find the front cover very interesting to look at (but I don't judge a book by its cover, anyway). It's almost appalling to think that this was ever published.I did like one thing about Eragon, and that was the premise. The plot about a boy befriending a dragon sounds really touching (Cornelia Funke's Dragon Rider is an example of the premise done right). Unfortunately, this exact idea had to be the victim of a simplistic, formulaic plot. If you have read Tolkien's Lord of the Rings and have seen the original Star Wars trilogy, then you will notice major similarities. This is arguably the oldest formula in fantasy fiction: average villager goes on an epic journey, villager discovers he is a ""chosen one,"" villager battles against all odds in order to defeat the villain. We've seen this story before. Both Tolkien & George Lucas used the exact same formula for their own works, but unlike Paolini, both of them added in some fresh material and made these stories undoubtedly their own. Here, Paolini has made no changes whatsoever to the formula. And that's one of the bigger problems with Eragon's plot. There is no originality found in the entire story. Seriously, it's so overstuffed with clichés that if I were to count them all, I would give up halfway through due to exhaustion.The characters are clichéd as well. We have elves, dwarves, witches, the works. We haven't seen these races before, have we? Plus, every protagonist, antagonist, and supporting character is very 2-dimensional. The villains are always evil, while the heroes are always good. That's it. There is no development on their motives, their personalities, or their causes & effects on the actual story. There is absolutely nothing that makes them distinctive. Brom, Katrina, and Murtagh are bad enough, but it's the character of Eragon himself that tops them all with his strange appearance and personality. First of all, the fifteen-year old boy talks and acts like a grown adult sometimes. One minute, his dialogue in simple, and the next minute, it's almost Shakespearean. He is of average intelligence, and yet he has the ability to talk like a scholar from time to time? Where did this sort of logic come from? Secondly, he somehow learns about sword-fighting in a matter of weeks, and is able to fight in battle a few months later. I know this sort of thing is acceptable in fantasy fiction, but this is just pushing too far. I mean, he's only a kid, and yet he is educated so quickly about the rules of combat. That.....is beyond my understanding. Thirdly, since he discovers he has become a dragon rider, his personality soon changes. Or rather, it changes from strange to even stranger. As I was reading, I couldn't help but see that Eragon and others are starting to see him as a messiah. This leads to the formation of arrogance. But even that soon becomes illogical, since his change of emotion is all over the place. Luckily, I saved myself from the confusion by concluding that Eragon is not a likable character. I couldn't really care about him, and that leads to my fourth problem with this character. Throughout the book, Eragon is always the main focus. It's either about him and his dragon Saphira, his encounter with people of various races, and his commitment (or lack thereof) to defeat the antagonists. It's almost always about him, and it sometimes gets annoying. Why does it always have to feel like he's the center of attention? If there were two or three more characters (of the same age) that journeyed along with Eragon, then it would have been far more interesting, because it wouldn't always be about this one boy. We would have some real friendship and cooperation; we would have teamwork instead of solo accomplishments. It would have made some intriguing material. And finally, the fifth problem I have with Eragon is that he doesn't have any real chemistry with the other characters. It seems that his relationships with Saphira, Brom, Roran, and Arya feel very forced; the conversations aren't very compelling (Brom and Eragon's discussions are especially painfully dull). In addition, Eragon always argues with his friends, but then he is united with their own views later on. This really brings a ton of confusion to their interactions with one another. And why in the world is Eragon always with ADULTS and not kids his own age? Wouldn't that affect his social capabilities when he reaches his own adulthood? *sigh*The plot and characters are bad, but the writing itself is another matter. People are always saying that Paolini is a brilliant writer, and that he has created a work of art. Paolini himself has compared his work to Lord of the Rings and Beowulf. Have we really lost our intelligence? This book would be torn apart if it were up against Lord of the Rings. And yes, I have read both Beowulf and Lord of the Rings; these two are rightfully named as literary classics. Eragon is not, and if it is, then humanity is lost forever. Moreover, Paolini's writing style really puzzles me. There are too many uses of the word ""was."" There are misplaced verbs, adverbs, and adjectives everywhere, as well as an excessive amount of them in general. The ""show, don't tell"" rule is broken many times. And who can forget those unnecessary similes? Well, neither can I. The writing is indeed excruciating.And now, we come to a very important element of the novel: the demographic. Is this supposed to be aimed at kids or teens? Is this suitable to grownups? Is it for people of all ages? I don't know. I can't really tell. Even though this is originally for younger audiences, I think it's a bit debatable. The violence suggests that it's for adults, but the simplistic storyline might indicate that it's for kids. It's almost to the point that it is a mystery that needs to be solved. In the end, I'd say both kids and adults deserve better.I could go on forever with what's wrong with this novel, but I can't. Why? Because I don't think I can take the pain of doing so! Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, this is it! This is the abomination that I, and many others, have sadly experienced! Eragon is simply the worst book that I have ever read in my entire life. Almost everything about it is a failure. Clichéd plot, dull characters, idiotic hero, laughable dialogue, slow pacing, deplorable writing, and a questionable tone dominate over 500 pages of boredom and pain. And I don't care if the author wrote this at a young age. He should have delayed the publication of his work in order to make some major improvements. Don't get me wrong, Paolini does have some potential. Unfortunately, it doesn't show here. Aside from all the flaws, Eragon does have one thing going (apart from the premise mentioned above). As an aspiring writer, this book has given me some splendid advice on how NOT to write a novel. You got to give Paolini some credit for making us see what's wrong and what's right. Overall, Eragon is an agonizing read from the Prologue to the glossary. It's an embarrassment in the fantasy genre, and it's pure trash. I can't wait to return it to the library.Grade: FP.S.This book is so terrible, that it makes me wonder if Eldest is even worse.....",0,0,0,0
R3T381HY7NL7EB,"This movie was awful.  It doesn't deserve any stars at all, frankly.

""condoms are not a terribly effective form of birth control, with failure rates at 15 percent...[out of one hundred women] ten to fifteen will be pregnant within a year if condoms are the only form of contraception"".  I mean - it's just blatantly wrong.  Condoms ARE actually an effective form of birth control and they prevent against STDs.  They are 98% effective and every failure does not necessarily equate to a pregnancy.  2.  ""Few parenting concerns during adolescence generate as much emotional turbulence as the possibility that one's child might have a homosexual orientation"".  Full disclosure - I am pregnant with my first child right now so I am not sure what will freak me out when my boy is a teenager.  However, I suspect that if my child has a ""homosexual orientation"", I'll detect some clues long before adolescence.  I imagine I will also have a laundry list of parenting concerns that are likely to generate more turbulence for me before I get to his sexual orientation.  Is he getting good grades?  Is he doing drugs or alcohol?  Is he committing any crimes?  Is he respectful and loving?  Is he happy?  3. when attempting to prevent your teenage daughter from date rape, ""you are much better off dating some you know fairly well rather than someone who is a...chance acquaintance"".

R33FXKEQC6W8FU,"Overall impression: Would not buy again, but would try a different brand on Amazon. These are not comparable in quality to well known brands, but somewhat less expensive. Nice carrying case.Cons:About 1/3 of the pens are scratchy on paper from first use until I take out the replaceable cartridge and replace it with a new one, which is often not scratchy (luck of the draw?)Ink flow skips approximately 25% of the time in all of the pens, which means more than 1/4 of the time I am coloring, the pens are skipping or I am slapping them against my palm to get the ink to flow down to the tip so I can start coloring again. This happens with new refills and old ones, but more frequently with used cartridges, of course.Cost is high in comparison to similar type pens on AmazonColor names often are highly misleading--always test the colors, as mine did not come with a color coded sheet to show you what the color actually looks like on paper, so I have scribbles everywhere and finally just went through and made my own color coded sheet for referencePros:Huge variety of colors (but an awful lot of greens and purples in comparison to some other colors, with several of the greens looking pretty much the same, in my opinion)Carrying case is very handy (my favorite feature)Refills are great/necessary, especially since I've had to replace 1/3 of the cartridges almost immediately on use (but I'm paying for the refills, so I don't know if this is actually a pro??? I guess this is a con, because I had to throw out full cartridges because of the scratchy tips, so 1/3 of the ""refills included"" ended up being used immediately, which makes the set cost more, not less)Variety of metallics, neons, and glitters (do they make a solid set? That would be nice too)*Picture caption: that leaf is colored with the green peridot pen. As you can see, there are two leaf segments that are very scratchy looking. When that happened, I wiped off the tip of the pen, tried it on discard paper, and when I saw that it wasn't getting better, I replaced it with a refill. The rest of the leaf is with the new pen refill. But now I don't have a refill with the peridot color and had to throw away a basically unused cartridge because of the scratchy tip. As another reviewer said, this process of scratchy and skipping is extremely annoying when I am trying to engage in a relaxation coping skill. It is so annoying that I stopped coloring just now to come and write this review.",0,0,0,0
R2LO6R4RUPDP0E,"(...)In a sentence, ""EBK4"" may arguably be the album upon which Lynch's downward spiral began. It was extremely disappointing to hear this subpar release from him, especially after the pristine ""Loaded"" (1997). Even more disappointing is the fact that this release could've been A LOT better had Lynch (and management) ousted the annoyances that make guest appearances on the album (yes, I referred to the guests in the third-person as impersonal adjectives, and they're barely worth that accreditation).I don't know about you, but the excellent first song ""Catch You"" goes to crap when the low-class lyric spittin loser Cocaine (what kind of name is that anyway?!?) does the last verse. He has that disgusting Cali drawl, couldn't author a convincing lyric to save his life (""...dump this clip/on yourself I make you sh**...""), and given his trashy ways, tries to make slapping a prostitute sound ""gangsta."" No Coca-Leaf, it sounds stupid, and yes, we are all chuckling at your dense and brainless nonsense.Next up, is the second song ""Hunter Killa,"" the opening verse of which Lynch murders! ::yawn:: Then some no-name cat, Kyel, spits the last verse, ruining the track! You would think Black Market [Records] and Lynch would've wisened up after featuring Coca Plant on ""Catch You;"" why did Lynch and management let these no-talent having ingrates on his album?Compounding the severity of matters, there are some very forgetable moments on ""EBK4"" as well. For instance, ""Every Single B****"" features a beat Phonk Beta should've thrown out; producers are NOT supposed to keep EVERYTHING they make, and it seems like Beta just wouldn't let this one go (he should have).However, I'll let ""Every Single B****"" slide, because the life sentence serving X-Raided (aka Nefarious) is credited with authoring the lyrics Lynch spits on his behalf. I was somehow relieved when I saw that in the album's credits because Lynch has NEVER wasted an ENTIRE song talking about ::gasp! surprise!:: scandalous females (because rappers talking about women has never been done before, right?). Although we can (and should) blame the author, which is X-Raided for such garbage, Lynch is still held accountable because he either could've asked management to cut the song from the final mix, or have done it himself.""Raw Meat"" was another beat Beta should've thrown away because it SUCKS, not to mention it features the very weird Keak da Sneak (aka Mr. Sicaluphacous?!??) from the very forgetable trio 3X Krazy (remember that song they had back in the day, ""Keep It On Real""?). Hey, if you can understand half of what Mr. Keak da Freak says in his insanely stupid verse, you're a better listener than me; 80% of his dumb-speak is nearly indecipherable.""One Time"" is another bunk Beta beat (I'm starting to sound repetitious). It features an annoying synth bass noise, looping over and over and over and over......Bad Azz is on this song, and while he's never been an exceptional rapper, he's definately at his worst here. Lynch and Bad Azz must've come up with the tired chorus upon waking up one morning - it's that crappy.Both thumbs and big toes down to Beta for giving Lynch these stanky, putrid, repulsive beats, and a head slap goes to Cedric Singleton for allowing this crap to make the final cut! -- I suppose being an ""executive producer"" is just another title carrying no meaning in gangsta rap. With releases like this, no wonder Black Market went belly up (because their sales went ""barely up"" after Lynch finally left).The last track, ""Blood On da Rug"" is the exact same song as ""Evidence 2000"" (featured on the terrible compilation ""Book III: The Best of Lynch"") with a different beat...okay, different the beat is not - just listen to it. Doesn't the beat for ""Blood On da Rug"" sound just like the one for ""Raw Meat"" (feat. Keak da Sneak)??!?!? Having produced every song on this album, maybe his overall mediocrity was a sign for Phonk Beta to go ahead and hang it up. Featured on ""Blood"" is the not-even-worth-mentioning T-Mac; I guess they figured he was so bad, they'd just put him on the last verse to the last song.Disregarding the ones I just blew on, most of the songs on ""EBK4"" don't suck, but they are slightly below average compared to what we're used to hearing from Lynch. These below-average songs include ""Naked Cheese,"" ""Holding On,"" ""My Love"" (although the concept was cool), ""Dogg Market"" feat. Snoop when he was still on No Limit, and ""Dramatic.""Standouts in my opinion are ""Split Yo Face,"" ""Can't Have It,"" and the classic ""Excalibur"" (Lynch murders this song, especially the first verse!).Again, this album begins Lynch's downward spiral into mediocrity and ultimately obscurity in comparison to the music he created in his heyday. Only time will tell if Lynch rises from the ashes and is able to redeem himself, especially after releasing the REPUGNANT ""Lynch By Inch,"" the latter which I wouldn't even shake a dirty penny at. I bought ""EBK4"" for about $6, which is about all it's worth, $2 for the 3 really dope tracks on this album. On top of that, I spent sack lunch money on this CD knowing what I was getting - my aunt took my first copy of this CD.You can if you want, but I wouldn't purchase ""EBK4"" for any more than about $6. If you want GOOD Lynch siccmade music, go for the albums ""Season of da Siccness: The Resurrection"" or ""Loaded,"" both of which you'll be heartily satisfied with.

RYMILA45Z65B6,"In terms of style, the director has created an eye-catching film.  But it all goes downhill from there.  I went into this one having read many reviews here at Amazon, and approached the movie with open-mindedness, but to no avail.  The few things I liked about this flick were eroded away ever so certainly as the film progressed, entrapping itself in a morass of illogic, self-contradiction, and out of place dramatic moments.  I have seen more sense in Roadrunner cartoons, and that's saying very little indeed.",0,0,0,0

R172DUXOQV83SQ,"This is the first item i've ever given one star to and I know i'm going to get slated as so many other reviewers here rave about it. I'm sorry to say it has many faults. I feel it is poorly written and has little to keep you engaged. You get no real feel for the main people in the book and the constant questioning of Don Juan that is refused an answer, or that receives some pseudo spiritual response, is extremely tedious. The hallucinogenic visions are uninspiring to read and the interpretations are spurious. The second half that attempts to analyse the 'lessons' from the experiences is jargon laden and tries to be too clever. As a text explaining various Yaqui rituals it has some merit, and it's explanations of drug preparation is fairly clear, but you can get this information online without trawling through such uninspiring dross. I have read many, many books of a spiritual nature, as well as many books on a variety of topics, as my varied and extensive reviews will illustrate, and I'm really sad to have given a book so highly praised by others such a low review, but I really disliked this book and felt it has very little to offer in terms of spiritual message. Easier reads, with clearer messages are out there (The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho, or Way of the Peaceful Warrior by Dan Millman to name two mainstream books and a whole host of more in-depth and meaningful books) and this book only serves to muddy what should be ones clear path to deeper spiritual growth. I can only apologise to those who love and gained some form of enlightenment from it!!!Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.",0,0,0,0

R1W3H0K8VPOTY4,"I actually loved Taryn and all her smart-mouthed sass. The plot was perhaps a bit simple in essence but the book was really made by the focus on character and character interactions. That said, the hyper focus on sex got repetitive and boring quickly. In fact, nearly every sexual episode would ultimately become a turn off and have me wondering why I kept reading. This book was nearly a DNF numerous times. Even at the very beginning where it's all about Trey's rock hard rock in response to simply meeting Taryn for the first time.The real problem with the sex scenes for me was how increasingly nonconsensual they became over the first half of the book. It came to a head when she kept saying no but he continued to push it on her until she decided to give in. I don't care how aroused her body was, she didn't want it. And this was the scene where they realize they are true mates. I felt ill. You top that off with her being called ""my little hitch"" and ""good girl"" during sex when she never reacts favorably as well as his constant need to assert his dominance during sex even when she does choose to submit, which usually happens because he's found ways to verbally manipulate her into it. It read much more like emotionally abusive, nonconsenual D/s than wolf dominance games.Outside of the sex scenes I liked their dynamic, liked that they both had issues that served as obstacles and liked how they could compliment one another. Though I am still trying to figure out what on earth qualified Trey as ""psychotic"" other than going feral. He seemed possessive and overprotective but I'd expect that in a powerful alpha. He was repeatedly referred to as psychotic and unhinged but not once did he warrant that description.Overall this would have been at least a 3 star, enjoyable fluff book if it wasn't for all the gross noncon behavior during sex.",0,0,0,0

RUA9HG9IYA72W,"Pros: The controller connects to my Android phone, iPad and PC (only with the supplied dongle, BT connection to PC does NOT work). The phone clip holds the phone rather well. Pairing the controller with various devices is pretty easy. Battery life is very good.Cons: The controller has some quality issues. The A and B buttons are very loud, especially when released. It sounds like a dog clicker. The other buttons are somewhat quieter but still a bit loud. Both D-Pads feel loose, not on the horizontal plane but on the vertical (the direction in which they click). This looseness causes the D-Pads to audibly click twice when pressed. Both D-Pads have a significant dead zone in the upper left corner, even after calibration on PC they still performed very poorly. Since there is no calibration on iOS or Android this is a big problem. While the controller feels hefty, it also feels slightly cheap. The plastic molded top and bottom meet at a sharp edge that feels somewhat uncomfortable. Latency with Bluetooth is pretty bad, it feels like the response time is around 200ms, could be more. Last con I have is that the top of the controller is a smooth plastic that is a finger print magnet. I don't have oily hands but after a few minutes of usage, it looked like I had been holding breakfast sausages prior to gaming (I had not).Overall I am giving this controller 2 stars because it does connect to all the devices as advertised. But due to performance issues and quality issues I can't recommend anyone spend $40 on it.",0,0,0,0

R355D42RWP0CTZ,"I mistakenly purchased this wheel since I needed a cheap replacement for a commuter bike and I needed fast (Prime). As other reviewers have mentioned, the inside of this wheel is a serious danger zone for any inner tube. There are many sharp holes and where the spokes screw in are not particularly flat. I have presently punctured TWO tubes just filling them with air, including one that was fine on another rim. Another major issue is that the wheel requires serious truing; it did not spin uniformly at all and the tire rubbed against my frame upon initial installation. You will almost certainly need a spoke wrench if you buy this.Note that this is not a quick-release and that it is a bolt on wheel. The only even okay things about this wheel is that it is sturdy (heavy) and that it is easy to install a freewheel on. Other than those qualities, it is a dangerous choice.",0,0,0,0

R3DH091MG44EN7,"If the box wasn't so heavy, such that returning it would be simpler, I would return this item.  It was shipped with the lock locked before the lid was closed, so the lid was sitting on the lock bar, which bent it so I could not unlock it (the keys and instruction booklet are taped to the outer packing material, so I don't see why this was done).  Once I bent the lock bar a bit, I could open the lock, but the bar disappeared within the cheap lock housing and would not come out.  On top of this, the lock / key is very very cheap, and I could barely get the key in the lock (one key will go in, the other won't). To top it off, the lid is very heavy, and there is no usable molded lip to lift or let it down w/o smashing your fingers.  With a few design changes this would be a great box.For me, the unique must-have features about this were the 1hr rating and its ""legal paper"" size.  And that's why I'm going to keep it.

R2DWOSJKE09NJO,"My review probably will only apply to a select few people, namely, those who have had training in psychology and human behavior and those who are particularly aware of the intricacies of how they know and deal with the world and their feelings.This book is very basic, spending a lot of time discussing what grief is.  After that, the majority of the book revolves around becoming aware of your losses, including the positives and negatives of the loss and the same for the relationship with the person who was lost.  The authors take you through the creation of a grief graph, telling you that if you don't do it their way, you'll probably do it wrong.  I'm a bit defiant, so I did it my own way.  I can't see how I could screw it up, creating a chronological list of my losses.Following that is a relationship graph where you make a timeline for the relationship with the person you lost and label major positive and negative moments with the person.  Again, they tell you to do it their way.There is another step or two, but it all sets the reader up to a fairly over-simplified final task.The whole practice to me seemed really basic.  I was expecting multiple exercises to release grief, but it all comes down to writing a release letter, the title of which the authors apparently have copywritten.  There isn't a lot of information on other ways to close the relationship, and believe me, there certainly are.  I myself have grieved events in the past with release ceremonies, meditation, hard workouts, even driving in the mountains on a rainy day with the windows down.  It's all about closure, finding some completion to your loss, and you don't need to write a letter to do it.I felt that the majority of the book was filler, including lengthy explanations of the authors' grief and relationship graphs.  As such, I skipped major portions of the book.  I found a few tidbits useful, but for the most part, this is all stuff that I've studied or pondered on my own.Another major problem I had with this book is that 90% is focused on awareness.  Awareness does not create behavior change.  Awareness of your grief does nothing to help you get over it.  Knowing the intricacies of the lies you've been told about grieving do nothing to lead you to resolving your grief.  What really needs to be done is creating a plan of action to close out each grief situation and resolve them individually.  When the author only gives you one way to do it, you may feel a bit funneled into one valid resolution to your grief.  This is limiting to me, and I'm not feeling too thrilled about writing a scripted letter.For someone that is brand new to grieving, this is a very slow, very easy introduction to grief.  It'll get most people where they need to go, especially if they can find a partner willing to sit through all the group sessions they recommend scheduling.For someone with a working knowledge of psychology, or for those that are awake, aware and know themselves well, this will seem like a bit of a bore, too tedious, and maybe even like a waste of time.At the end of the day, this is a book that was written 20 years ago, in a time when people just weren't as in touch with their own feelings (in general) as they are now.  The material and writing feels dated and dusty.  This book and the technique need a serious re-write.  A solid update of the material and presentation could make a gem out of a mediocre title.",0,0,0,0
RYOONN0MGISC2,"DNF 13%I wanted to love this book, I even expected to! It sounded as my cup of tea as I started reading it. A strange kinda gal, not especially good looking (or rather not your typical beauty), smart in an unconventional kind of way, the kind who attracts too much attention to her strangeness and embarrass herself when she is trying her best not to. This sounds so ME on so many levels! It should ABSOLUTELY be my ""thing"", yet I was annoyed and bored out of my mind I couldn't be bothered to listen to Jaine's inner voice.Sadly, this is a DNF at 13%. Usually I give a quarter of a book a chance before I give it up, but here since the main character won't change there is no use in waiting for the plot to save me as Jaine seems to be the sole POV in this one so no matter what happens I am stuck with her anyway...I can't really tell you what it is about since it's basically what you can read on the synopsis - Jaine is having the worst day ever - breaking up with her boyfriend and losing her job being the major points yet there is one bright spot - Quinn Sullivan - the HOT security guy who escorts her out of the building she used to work in. Later on they meet again in a very strange looking club. This is where I stopped. They suppose to meet quite a lot of times or him being in the wrong or rather right place in the wrong time yet the right time. Somehow being there for her.This book IS funny in a very geeky kind of way, yet I can't really ""get"" the main character, her detachment from the world around her, and especially emotional detachment baffles me. I don't understand how a person with so much regressed emotion or someone who can't handle emotion at all is taught by a psychologist to put the emotions aside. I'm no psychologist myself, buy I DID study the basics and this just makes NO SENSE AT ALL. It also makes Jaine more of a robot than a real person. I have no problems with analytic people, but she is totally devoid of anything HUMAN! Well, besides embarrassing herself which is something you WOULD expect from an alien who doesn't really understand human behavior which is EXACTLY how Jaine feel.While she might be on the autistic scale I have a strong feeling that's NOT what the author was after. If it WAS the idea behind the book it would have been portrayed differently I'm sure! (and if so I have a strong feeling I would have loved it and appreciate the subject being brought into contemporary romance) Yet what we did get is a person who is incapable of dealing with emotions and HIGHLY lacking in social skills and THIS is the person who tells the story. A woman who is after facts of life and not living it.As you can guess I won't be continuing to read this series. Right to this point there are 4 full novels and one ""in between"" novel but there is at least one more planned.Tags: Contemporary RomanceMore Reviews - http://ultrameital.blogspot.co.il",0,0,0,0

RW46F6AJVJ3SD,"I bought this out of the $5 bin at the local Walmart - I figured it would be the typical History Channel-type presentation, dealing with the gradual buildup of the war, the growing protest to it, and the gradual swing of majority public opinion to a stance against the war.  I was a bit surprised, frankly a bit shocked, to see that it was just a collection of Defense Department-produced films, which, as other reviewers point out, are basically just propaganda pieces trying to sell the war.  This would have been alright if the DVD had been labeled as such (i.e. ""An interesting look at the Government's viewpoint on the war"" or something like that), but the back cover represents this DVD as just another  typical documentary of the war.  I am not ""anti-military,"" and I certainly don't agree with a person who commented on one of reviews of this DVD, saying that the soldiers who fought in the war should be blamed for doing that; however, I am a bit concerned to think that younger people who may not know that much about the war would watch this and think that it is a fair and balanced view of it, because it is not, although it is quite interesting for what it is, and does give quite a unique perspective that has not been emphasized in other treatments of the war (perhaps with good reason!)Anyway, I gave the DVD only 2 stars, because of what I feel is misleading labeling as above, or at least lack of clear labeling as to what this is.  Also, I felt that as a result of this, the DVD was in quite poor taste.  For example, it was a bit sickening to see the spin that was put on some of the battles, such as the section on the battle of Khe Sanh;  the part where the commanding officer was talking about the ""variety of menus"" to be found cooking up in the trenches at the base is a good example of this - he almost makes it sound like a picnic in the mountains...  If you want to read a good account of the siege of Khe Sanh, read ""Dispatches"" by Michael Herr (he also wrote the narrative from Apocalypse Now); he talks about how the soldiers at Khe Sanh used to take anti-diarrheal pills to limit their trips to the latrines, which were more exposed to enemy fire; how the bodies piled up so fast that they had to stacked up beside the medical tent, and there were piles of body parts hastily covered with bloody tarpaulins; how every inch of the landing field was bracketed by enemy mortars, and you never went anywhere at less than a run (he actually lived on the Khe Sanh base with the Marines for an extended period during the middle of the siege).  I'm not taking away from the bravery of the men who fought there, but it was a nasty piece of business, and at the end, the four plus NVA regiments that were thought to be in the area just melted away into the wilderness, leaving few bodies despite truly massive bombardment around the clock by B-52's for months, which to me just characterizes the weirdness, craziness and pointlessness of that war.Another must-see moment on this disc is the segment ""No Substitute for Victory,"" when yes, good ol' John Wayne gets up there and tells us how it is...  how those Commies and Reds are hypnotizing the young folks, and asserting that the anti-war movement was obviously a Communist conspiracy...  I have to admit that the DVD is interesting and informative in some ways, in the sense that it's always good to know what ""the other guys"" had to say, but it is a complete distortion of the history of the war as it's generally understood, and to label this as a straight documentary is an almost criminal oversight in my opinion...Anyway, just my 2 cents, take it or leave it...",0,0,0,0

It seemed that my baby's eczema started going away - and it was barely noticeable, her skin was very soft and not dry nor bumpy. So, I ordered second container...When it arrived it was packed the same way as the first order - when i opened it, it had completely different texture and it smelled like chocolate for whatever reason.I used it anyways, and the very next day my baby got rash on her legs and mainly her elbows - it looked like an allergic reaction to this product. Not sure why 1st order worked out so well, but not the 2nd.I just need consistency when it comes to my babys skin.Old Review: I primarily bought this product to treat my 15 months old baby eczema, and end up using it for diaper rash instead of aquaphor as well!So far I love it!  I even used it for my chapped lips the other day - and it helped a lot.It does not have any smell - which I also like, but I guess it will depend on the person!

Better, even look into the many Jewish critiques of ultra-orthodox Jewry by reformist, conservative and secular Jews within Israel for a sense of how fundamentalist Judaism reeks of a hateful, inbred insanity -truly!Go to the website of Hemdat, which recounts tales of this breed assaulting old, Jewish women for using their electric wheelchairs on Saturday, or slinging their own excrement at synagogues they regard as deviant.The pretense that Hasids are even remotely spiritually generous to any human being outside of their narrow faith is complete stupidity, hypocrisy or cowardice.Like Bloom's work on Postville, the author here has failed completely to transcend her tribe in order to provide a fair critique of this entirely ugly movement.",0,0,0,0
R28BX07SB6UBHH,"I tried, folks.  I honestly did.  This is supposed to be a classic, and I'm usually willing to give most classic novels a fair shake.  But this novel's status as a classic and one of the earliest novels wasn't enough to make me persevere.  Even classics should still be well-written and entertaining, in my opinion, and despite being one of the most famous novels in the world, this book is neither.Most people are familiar with at least the central conceit of this novel -- the titular Crusoe is stranded on a desert island and has to fend for himself, alongside the native man he befriends and makes his servant.  Many reviews have touched on the racist undertones of this book already, and I'll simply state that yes, they're present, and yes, they were the prevailing attitude at the time.  This doesn't make these views and attitudes RIGHT, but it's an explanation, though not an excuse.My main problem with this book is that it's just so stupefying boring.  Yes, it was written at a different time, and language and word usage has shifted, but it's still a chore to read.  Defoe manages to make things that should be exciting, like a lion attack and a terrible storm at sea, mind-numbing instead of thrilling.  He has no qualms about a single lengthy run-on sentence taking up an entire paragraph, or to splice a bunch of unrelated thoughts together with semicolons.  Maybe this was how people wrote back in the day, I don't know... but it sure doesn't make it readable.I gave up on ""Robinson Crusoe"" about 10% of the way through.  Yes, I'm a quitter, but I don't care if this is a classic.  I was reading it for fun, not to analyze or study or for a class, and so I have no qualms about bailing now and warning people that, unless you want to analyze this book's writing or social mores, stay away from it.",0,0,0,0
R28S8ZRRNSYCWY,"The first line in the foreward to Bill O'Reilly's latest opus starts out ""I wish I'd had this book when Iwas a teenager ...""Really Bill? You wish you'd had a book written by you as a 55-year-old man? You know, I also wishthat as a teenager I'd had a book written by a future me. The first line of my book would have been, ""Inabout 20 years, a spectacularly obtuse TV personality named Bill O'Reilly will write a piece of dreckcalled The O'Reilly Factor for Kids. Whatever you do, for the love of Jehovah, DON'T READ IT.""While Bill's ridiculously inflated ego is more than evident in the first line of this piffling waste of pulp,one would have thought it impossible even for someone as delusional and self-important as O'Reillyto think he could actually pull this off.Indeed, it may not be all that much of a stretch to say that Bill O'Reilly, in the Year of our Lord 2004,has written the worst book in the history of publishing.This is an impossibly stupid effort. Seriously, I'm waiting for God to come jumping out of a closet anysecond to tell me my entire life has been one long, embarrassing practical joke and this is the punchline.Honestly, if you were a publisher casting about for someone to write a book that speaks to teensfrankly and in their own language about the pitfalls of growing up, it's hard to imagine a worse choicethan Fox News' loudest, dumbest and most meretricious newsman.I myself have spent a good part of the morning trying to imagine a worse choice and all I've been ableto come up with so far are Rip Taylor, Pope John Paul II, John Holmes and Fred ""Rerun"" Berry.Unfortunately, Taylor had prior commitments, Holmes and Berry are dead, and John Paul is probablytoo busy, so O'Reilly, working for the Bizarro wing of HarperCollins, apparently got the gig by default.The O'Reilly Factor For Kids' putative purpose is to give teens some honest, straightforward advicefrom a guy who's been there and who, as a father himself, knows how to rap with the kids. Instead, it's a deeply confused tract on everything from sharing to reasoning with bullies to proper skin care (we'll get to this one later). At times, Bill sounds like he's talking to 5-year-olds (""You have to learn -- andbelieve me, I know how awful these words can be when you want something -- to share."");sometimes he appears to be counseling the elderly (""But excessive sun exposure, according to theU.S. Office of the Surgeon General, can lead to skin cancer and other skin growths, cataracts,premature aging of the skin, and several other types of health problems""); but most of the time hesounds like a deranged Carmelite nun trying to relate to teenagers on their own level (""The adultdoesn't have to be in the room snappin' to OutKast, but one of these specimens must besomewhere on the premises ..."")Is this a joke? Wait, perhaps I haven't explored that possibility thoroughly enough. Bill, seriously, isthis a joke?  Well, it must be a joke, because there's a belly laugh on every page. Don't believe me?Page 3 (following the above-mentioned, stunningly idiotic foreward): ""Almost everybody watchedthe TV show Friends on NBC. Unfortunately, some kids think that's what real friends are like. ... Inreal life, true friends stand by you when things get rough.""(Yes. Now let's go visit Mr. Green Jeans and see what he thinks.)Page 4: ""Okay, you know I've made money. It was a long time coming, so I don't usually spendmuch of it and I certainly don't show it off.""(OK, Bill, obviously you do show it off. You're now averaging one reference to your huge salary everytwo pages. [Page 1: ""I have a career that's lots of fun and makes me a lot of money.""] For God's sake,Bill, these are kids! Can you possibly be this insecure? Do you flash a fat roll of Benjamins in front ofthe dog every morning, cooing, ""Who's your daddy?"")Page 5: ""Now, I don't want you to think that I sat around when I was your age and carefully chosemy companions because of their virtues.""(Carefully chose my companions because of their virtues? Are you kidding with this? Who are youtalking to? `Cause I guarantee you, all the kids have left. You sound like Truman Capote, for God'ssake. Can you possibly be this tone deaf? You might as well quote Ralph Waldo Emerson while you're at it.)Page 7: ""'Keep your friendships in repair,' warned Ralph Waldo Emerson ...""(Bill, I can't prove it right now, but I'm pretty sure you plagiarized that from Tiger Beat.)Page 6: ""If a kid lies to his parents, he or she will lie to you.""OK, Bill? I haven't used the word gaywad in probably 25 years. Please don't force my hand.)Page 8: ""Growing up on Long Island just a few miles outside New York City, I had tons of friends inthe neighborhood. They were all guys, because at that time women's lib had not kicked in and thegirls played differently than we did.""(Think. Who is your audience? The last time anyone said ""women's lib"" these kids' parents' werezygotes. Just stop talking. You are beyond embarrassing. I guarantee your kids are plotting yourdeath right now.)It's actually quite stunning that this book ever saw print. It's certainly not intended for kids -- not any onthis planet anyway. In fact, there's no question this has to either be a cynical ploy to sell books tothose O'Reilly fans who are still teed off about NBC's decision to cancel Bonanza, or O'Reilly isirretrievably insane and is sincerely hoping to reach today's teenagers with lines like, ""If you knewthat a few minutes spent with an older person could ease his loneliness, why would you ever chooseto spend those minutes playing Game Boy instead?""I can say with confidence there is not one teenager in the nation who will read past page 3 of thisbook and want to continue ... or at least there are very few. And when I say very few I'm talking roughlythe same number of death row inmates who subscribe to Redbook.Indeed, if I were a PR flack and had my choice between taking a job with Union Carbide's Bhopaloffice circa 1984 or being responsible for promoting this crap, I think I'd take the Union Carbide gig.While he claims to believe he's helping kids out, what O'Reilly has actually just done is consignedhundreds of innocent children of Factor viewers to the worst Christmas break they've ever had.Honestly, this should have been published as one introductory chapter and 178 blank pages. No onebut O'Reilly and me, who was assigned this review by SJIHBO co-founder and modern-dayTorquemada Joseph Minton, would have been the wiser.There's absolutely nothing interesting, fresh or insightful here. The entire book is little more than anassortment of dull anecdotes from O'Reilly's childhood alongside regurgitated bromides fromelementary school health classes and old `50s hygiene films. The thing makes Reefer Madness lookcool.Throughout the book, for example, there are ""instant messages"" from O'Reilly where he delineatesthe difference between ""pinheads"" and ""smart operators.""According to O'Reilly, ""a pinhead is a kid who brags about how much money she has or how muchmoney she's spent on something."" (No argument there.)""A smart operator is a kid who gets a decent night's sleep so that everyone else doesn't have tosuffer with him the next day.""He's got four whole chapters full of this crap. It looks like he lifted stuff straight out of a 1946 copy ofBoy's Life and then removed all the edginess.In Pinheads and Smart Operators: Instant Message Number 3, Bill writes ""IMNSHO (which O'Reillyand all teens apparently know means `In my not-so-humble opinion'), a pinhead gets sunburned.Okay, a nice even tan can make you look healthy and sexy. Or it can advertise to your friends thatyou've had a great winter vacation at the beach. But excessive sun exposure, according to the U.S. Office of the Surgeon General ..."" -- and then on he goes about those legendary teen bugabooscataracts as well as studies from Boston University and the Centers for Disease Control. (Or the BUto the CDC as O'Reilly might put it.)First of all, Bill, I hate to be crass, but have you seen your skin? You look like something Ed Geinmade after he was finished upholstering the settee. Do you think you're really going to reel kids inwith your thoughts on proper skin care? If they didn't bail out after your take on gangsta rap (page 85,I'm not even kidding), you've definitely lost them now.Secondly, these kids are 14 and 15; they weren't born in 1914 or `15. Honestly, what do you think you're accomplishing? Why not just write, ""A pinhead finds blood in his stool and ignores it. A smartoperator gets regular colorectal screenings and eats a diet rich in fiber""?Unfortunately, this book will impress no one -- not the teens whom it's supposedly written for nor thegrandparents whom O'Reilly was probably actually hoping to fleece. It's just plain too stupid.I'm 39 now, and I know it's sometimes tough to remember what it was like to be a kid, and trying tomake heads or tails out of teens' culture, attitudes and beliefs years removed from your own painfuladolescence can be a Sisyphean task to be sure.But that's hardly the point. I remember fondly my grandmother on my mother's side. She and I hardlyhad anything to talk about other than the typical grandma/grandson stuff. As O'Reilly himself mightsay, she was ""squaresville."" For instance, she had a picture of Pope Paul VI on her wall -- 10 yearsafter he was dead. When I was a teen I used to mow her lawn; she'd give me $5 and some cookieswhen I was finished. I'm fairly certain that when I was 23 she still thought I was in Scouts.I wish she were alive, principally because she was my grandma and I loved her dearly, but closebehind that would be the opportunity to show her this book. I'm almost certain that by page 2 shewould have started rolling her eyes and done one of those ""I'm masturbating"" pantomimes.I have to admit now, in the interest of fairness, that I didn't read all of The O'Reilly Factor for Kids. Itook a cue from O'Reilly himself, who walked out of the middle of Fahrenheit 9/11, and ditched beforeI was done with it.Yeah, I can almost hear O'Reilly now -- ""a pinhead reviews a book he hasn't read in its entirety whilea smart operator gives it an honest shake."" But c'mon, Bill. It's not that difficult to extrapolate frombeginning to end. If I didn't get your wisdom on searching for changes in moles and freckles you'lljust have to forgive me. But the truth is, there's nothing here even remotely worthwhile. If your bookhad been a TV show, it would have been canceled at the first commercial.You had to know that.

RWETQD0G6V373,"Revolutions disappoints me the most of the three movies.  I am writing this for fellow sci-fi fans, and for myself, to briefly analyze the question - why the formula in the sequels do not work as well as the original Matrix.  So I'm mainly reviewing the movie in the 3-part series, not the DVD.All three main characters - Neo, Trinity and Morpheus - in Reloaded and Revolutions, are just too lifeless, aside from the obvious, that there is a departure from the story for the sake of big budget effects (Hey, I love well-made fx, don't get me wrong!)  Or is it just bad acting?  (I know, I know. They were supposed to be computerized.)  I'll tell you what I think is the culprit - those darn sunglasses.  Acting is in the eyes, and if you can't see the eyes, out goes the expression.  Why do they have to wear the sunglasses underground, also?  Fashion?  Who cares about looking cool when the whole world is coming to an end!  For argument sake, look back at the original Matrix.  Neo and Trinity were newbies and fresh, trying to solve the puzzle - how to save humanity.  There was more self-discovery in the ""real"" world, on board the Neberknezzer (mispelled, huh).  Neo, Trinity and Morpheus were not so busy trying to look cool as in the sequels.  Believe or not, my favorite character is the Oracle.  Even though she has a small part, she is the only one I care about the most.  She possesses a lot of spunk for a matrix concontion.  Too bad, the original actress, is not in Revolutions, because of her unfortunate, untimely death in real life.  (Did you catch the irony of what she eats in Reloaded?)  Revolutions take place 100% underground or in a very cloudy world, so you vampires will feel at home.  The Sentinals vs. the human machines is worth a look-see, but the Super Burly Brawl is not as fun to watch as before because the bad weather makes it hard to see.  I just wish Mr. Smith and Neo had chosen to slap-each-other-silly on a day that wasn't raining.  As a grand finale, the ending is convoluted, leaving more questions than answers.  It leaves an unsatisfactory feeling in my stomach, kind of like amusement park food.  As tragic as the story is going, The Wachowski Brothers sell out by slapping on a hollywood-like ending.  Sunny skies and all.If you don't care about the story that much, but want amazing visuals, I would recommend Reloaded over Revolutions.  The martial arts choreography, with weapons, this time, is amazing.  And the highway scene is unsurpassable.  However, if you can only afford one DVD in this series, and you want the best, get the first Matrix.  (Now, I have to figure out why George Lucas messed up the prequels.  Jar Jar... Lucas trying to please his kids...)",0,0,0,0

After I got home and removed the plastic, I noticed the journal had a dent right on the front where the removable paper label had been. There was also a scuff on the bottom right corner of the book. That didn't really bother me too much, but once I started filling out my journal I noticed that no matter what type of pen I used (005 art liner, ballpoint pen, mechanical pencil), the pages ghosted like crazy. The paper is very thin and not very good quality if even a mechanical pencil (pressed very lightly!) shows through to the other side. This means I have to leave every back page blank and I'm wasting half of the paper in the journal. Pretty disappointing for a journal with such high reviews.

R3NGPGGT4JE998,"When amazon delivered my copy of Alain de Botton's `Religion for Atheists' a couple of weeks ago, I read the first chapter, `Wisdom without Doctrine', a few days before I went on to read the rest of the book.  This first chapter struck me as the worst-presented argument I had ever read.  I am absolutely astonished at the case which de Botton presented there, and which, as I later read through the book, he repeats and repeats and repeats and then summarizes in his final chapter on `Institutions', in which he tells us that Auguste Comte (1798-1857) had anticipated much of what he (de Botton) is now proposing and recommending, but which Comte failed to implement and which de Botton seems to have no hope of being able to implement either.de Botton ends his introductory chapter with this paragraph:  "" ... this book ... tries ... to examine aspects of religious life which contain concepts that could fruitfully be applied to the problems of secular society.  It attempts to burn off religions' more dogmatic aspects in order to distil a few aspects of them that could prove timely and consoling to sceptical contemporary minds facing the crises and griefs of finite existence on a troubled planet.  It hopes to rescue some of what is beautiful, touching and wise from all that no longer seems true"" (p. 19).In this unbelievably blinkered book, de Botton makes a number of statements which are so naïve and unproved and unprovable and hopelessly cloud-cuckoo-land-ish that one must wonder how any publisher (here, Penguin) would publish it.I quote:  "" ... let us bluntly state that of course no religions are true in any God-given sense"" (p. 11).  What proof does de Botton produce for this statement?  None whatsoever, neither here nor anywhere else in his book.  He goes on:  ""Tough-minded critics of religion have found much pleasure in laying bare the idiocy of believers in remorseless detail, finishing only when they felt that they had shown up their enemies as thorough-going simpletons or maniacs"" (p.11).  de Botton never mentions the huge scholarly arguments which thoroughly disprove the atheists' case and show that it is the atheists who are the enemies of philosophy, common sense, and science.  The verdict which de Botton passes on the believing `simpletons and maniacs' is simply correctly attributable to de Botton himself.I quote from a review of a book similar to de Botton's, by his fellow-atheist AC Grayling, `The God Argument:  the Case against Religion and for Humanism'.  The review of Grayling's book says:  ""People are still debating whether or not `Life of Pi', book or film, can make you believe in God.  The novel didn't have that effect on me.  AC Grayling's book came much closer:  his `case for humanism' made me begin to long for faith ... What's most lamentable about this book [Grayling's] is not the quirks of tone, the Infelicities of emphasis or the inconsistency, indeed occasional lack, of method.  It's the façade of appreciating how believers have created great art, without recognizing the imaginative process behind it, and indeed behind faith"".  [The review is by Tom Payne, and appears in the Daily Telegraph's Saturday magazine supplement `Review', of 23 February 2013  -  before the Oscars considered the film `The Life of Pi'.]I can quote in the same sense Lord Rees (the Astronomer Royal), and the philosopher John  Gray and  Richard Dawkins, all atheists (or nearly so), who all agree that random atoms cannot account for the great art and music and literature of the Christian tradition  -  but they can offer no alternative explanation.  They simply expect us to believe that in some mysterious way the random atoms MUST be able eventually to explain this fact.De Botton goes on:  ""The premise of this book is that it must be possible to remain a committed atheist and nevertheless find religions sporadically useful, interesting and consoling, and be curious as to the possibilities of importing certain of their ideas and practices into the secular realm"" (pp. 11,12).  Notice the absurdity of de Botton's case.  He does not say that his book will show how it is possible to remain a committed atheist and nevertheless ...""  He tells us instead that IT MUST BE POSSIBLE TO REMAIN A COMMITTED ATHEIST AND NEVERTHELESS find religions sporadically useful ... "".  But this is an act of blind atheistic faith.  It is what his book should be attempting to prove.  But he offers not one shred of proof.  WHY MUST IT BE POSSIBLE TO REMAIN A COMMITTED ATHEIST AND NEVERTHELESS ... ""?de Botton goes on:  ""We can then recognize that we invented religions [trini asks:  did `we' invent Jesus Christ and the New Testament?] to serve two central needs which continue to this day and which secular society has not been able to solve with any particular skill:  first, to live together in communities in harmony, despite our deeply rooted selfish and violent impulses.  And second, the need to cope with terrifying degrees of pain which arise from our vulnerability to professional failure, to troubled relationships, to the death of loved ones and to our decay and demise.  God may be dead, but the urgent issues which impelled us to make him up still stir and demand resolutions which do not go away when we have been nudged to perceive some scientific inaccuracies in the tale of the seven loaves and fishes"" (p. 12).  One simply cannot take de Botton seriously as a thinker.  He seems unable to perceive any link between effect and cause.  He tells us that 'religions' which we invented, created the answers to all human problems, but nevertheless religion can't have created these solutions, because religion doesn't exist independently.He goes on:  ""I never wavered in my certainty that God did not exist.  I was simply liberated by the thought that there might be a way to engage with religion without having to subscribe to the supernatural content"" (p. 14). [Really?}  And so on and so on.  De Botton endlessly praises religion for providing all the answers to mankind's problems, but he goes on and on and on saying that religion `invented' these correct solutions, and that it is now up to atheism to provide the same solutions to these same problems, but without a `religious' base, and only after removing from these solutions everything that religion provided as the solutions (but which de Botton, with total illogicality, will not concede to be the very reason why these solutions worked).  The trouble for de Botton, however, is that, as he everywhere recognizes, there is no sign whatever of purely secular, atheistic, humanistic concepts and purely atheistic, secular and humanistic `thinkers ` ever being able to make the required solutions work.  For de Botton, the religious explanation (`plan A') must be eliminated, but over and over again de Botton concedes that his atheistic solution (`plan B') will not work with real human beings in the real world in which we live, and he has no `plan C'.  (What about returning to `plan A'?)There is the continuous insistence by de Botton, in every chapter, that every human need has been met by traditional religious (especially Christian) teachings and practices and institutions, but unbelievably he thinks it is now the task of the atheists to re-make and re-found all these dying (but essential) Christian practices and institutions with exactly similar (but atheistically founded) practices and institutions  -  which de Botton repeatedly admits will not and cannot work.Nietzsche, God is not dead.de Botton, atheism is dead.",0,0,0,0

R2KERWR4GYIEZW,"Now a lot of people have made some pretty harsh criticisms about the originality (or lack thereof) in Christopher Paolini's Inheritance Cycle. In this review I would like to refute some of these unfounded and unfair accusations. The main one of course being, that the series is a rip off of Star Wars.The series is about an order of ancient warriors called Dragon Riders who hold allegiance to no nation and use their martial, magical, and telepathic powers in the service of peace and justice. Now at first you may think they sound like Jedi, but they're not. You see Jedi use lightsabers, where as dragon riders just sue multi-colored indestructible swords. Totally different.About a hundred years before the start of the series an evil sorcerer named Galbatorix, not Palpatine, destroyed the riders, and established an evil empire. He did this with the help of a group of evil dragon riders called the Forsworn, the first of which was named Darth Morzan.The first book opens from the perspective of a young, sandy haired farm boy named Eragon. He is absolutely not Luke Skywalker, even though he was raised by his aunt and uncle, who are murdered by servants of the Empire shortly after he finds a mysterious object that belongs to the Empire, prompting him to flea home on a quest for vengeance.Accompanying him on this quest is Bromi-Wan Kenobi, the grouchy yet wise olf former dragon rider who gives Eragon his father's sword and teaches him just enough of the ways of the forc- I mean the ways of magic to get by, before he gets killed in the second act.After Bromi-Wan's death Eragon and his friends travel into the heart of Empire and rescue a princess named Arya, NOT Leia, that Eragon was having visions of (see, it's a VISION, not a hologram). With the princes Arya in tow, our heroes head south, to join an ALLIANCE of REBELS, called the Varden and combat the Empire's evil forces.This bring us to the second installment, where things start to get really unique and original. After an initial battle where Eragon and his companions manage to thwart the Empire, our hero travels to the homeland of the elves to meet his second teacher, who is not Yoda. UnYoda turns out to be yet another surviving dragon rider, who teaches Eragon deeper secrets of magic and telepathy, turning him into a force to be reckoned with. Unfortunately Eragon has to leave because he finds out his friends are in trouble, but before he does he promises to return to complete his training. Eventually he does return just long enough for UnYoda to reveal a secret about his family, and then die shortly later.At the climax of the book we find out something truly shocking. The Empire has managed to hatch a second dragon, a RED one, and the rider, reveals himself to be Eragon's brother, which means that Darth Morzan was his father! You see it's really nothing like the end of The Empire Strikes Back at all...Well things don't look too good for the Varden, but eventually Eragon manages to fight his way to the Emperor himself and challenge him. Unfortunately Eragon is totally outclassed by his more powerful opponent, but just when things look their worst, Darth Murtagh turns against the Emperor and saves him.Now in all seriousness, while Christopher Paolini managed to write a decent story, he did rip off many of his central plot points and characters from Star Wars, Wheel of Time, Lord of the Rings, and many others. That being said, if you can look past this, the story itself isn't that bad. My biggest problem with it is the utter lack of originality, and not just with the blatant plagiarism. The story adheres to almost every cliche and fantasy trope in the book. For young reader's it's okay, for more serious readers who want actual intellectual stimulation, I would suggest Wheel of Time, A Song of Ice and Fire, Malazan Book of the Fallen, The First Law Trilogy, etc.",0,0,0,0

However, Varidesk are outrageously priced $300-400.00 for a 26 and above desk.  So i decided to try ""Fezibo"" and this brand.  I like the Fezibo a lot and didn't like this one much at all.  It was discounted to $123.00 because it was a return.  I don't mind returned items because I usually get the best deals that way.  When I received this one I didn't think fancy I thought dang!  My monitor is about to fall off.  It wasn't steady enough.  If I leaned on it a little it leaned.  So I immediately boxed it back up and returned it.  For ""Free"".  Thanks PRIME...!  I'm sticking with Fezibo and their newest desk that utilizes more of the space and doesn't leap out at you when you rise it up and stand.  It stays within the same footprint as when it was down and close to the table.PS. I wasn't paid to write this and I'm not one of those professional reviewers.

Dude, it is so hard to be super good-looking! It is so hard! Ow. Typically, inferiorly good-looking Other People are trying to distract you from getting your denouement on with your also super good-looking prospective mate (like why is this plot taking so long? I have a waxing?)! Then the split screens make you harder to see (who would want to not see more of me?), and Ow, the damn oddly dusty-complected insecure (human, all too human) woman and just-not-square-male-enough (humans are so tiresome!) male supporting undergarment actor WILL take up way more screen time than, by the implicitly Nazi unconscious ideology of ""Foreground the Good-Looking! Only the Very Good-Looking!,"" they ought in any reasonable world to have. It is so unfair! I mean, the less good-looking you are, the more evil, unstable, and boring you are. Obviously. Everybody knows that. Finally the super good-looking people win and are reunited. Of. Course. But it takes way too long. So in the end I vote for you to not see this movie because you don't see enough of me (I mean us--I am a team player) in it.",0,0,0,0
R3UW05HBERCL3F,"I had high hopes for this book. Many books about the Franklin Expedition are far too technical and over the heads of average laypeople. While I enjoy technical books about arctic currents and wreckage dispersal, a nice narrative history of the original expedition and the later attempts to locate it is now long overdue.This books is NOT that concise, narrative history of Franklin etc. Instead, what you shall receive is a horrible mishmash of unconnected information, conjecture and petty political comments that smacks a little of the old ""chip on the shoulder"". A solid book of history should not be a Liberal diatribe against past Prime Ministers and even one's thoughts on smoking.The book also tends to ramble. A LOT. For example, almost an entire chapter is spent on the grandfather of an Inuit researcher who collected oral testimonies regarding past sightings of the Franklin expedition's ships. While I appreciate the Inuit oral history and detective work, and it was indeed extremely helpful in locating both ships, I do not need pages and pages of his grandfather, a Hudson's Bay Company worker who seemed to enjoy making love and fathering children with as many Inuit women as he could.For the readers of this review to judge, I give a few quotes that show why I truly disliked this book and my reasons for thinking that way:""They worked together exploring the the wreck of the RMS Titanic, the luxury cruise ship that hit an iceberg..."". The RMS Titanic was NOT a cruise ship. It was a transatlantic ocean liner that carried mail, cargo and immigrants to North America.""Prime Minister Stephen Harper set to work gagging federal scientists..."" Should political diatribes even be a part of a serious work of history? This is not an editorial in the Toronto Star (a very biased and tabloid-ish newspaper).While it may seem that I have an axe to grind with the author, I do not. I am a very prolific reader of history, politics, economics etc. It is simply that this book is riddled with errors, tends to fly all over the place in its narrative and leans towards editorial writing at its worst. Yes, we know by now that Royal Navy winter gear was shoddy and the Inuit sealskin boots can do no wrong. Can you please move on to something more interesting?",0,0,0,0
R2DONADZJFP7VW,"I saw this on NBC last December. I didn't watch it with high expectations, nor did I expect it to live up to it's predecessor (National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation), but what I was hoping for was something at least remotely amusing which would kill a couple of hours. Needless to say, I was asking for TOO much. This movie stinks on so many levels. First of all, aside from the mention of ""Christmas"" three or four times, the average person wouldn't know this was intended to be a ""Christmas"" movie. The family gets stranded on a deserted island (a la Swiss Family Robinson). There's your plot. They try to build a shelter......and fail. They look for food.....and fail. It's definitely nothing more than a big yawn-fest. They could've at least made the movie ""look"" real. The scene when the family is on the boat, you could tell the entire sky and water back-drop was blue-screened. There were no shadows what-so-ever. I've never seen anything look so fake. The only thing I remotely enjoyed about this was the presence of the original actress who portrayed Audrey in the original ""Vacation"" flick. But then, even her acting abilities were something yet to be desired. Now, with all of this being said. I AM going to get this. Call it a completist's curse or whatever. I have to collect my sequels, good or bad. So this will sit and collect dust right next to the far superior, far more enjoyable, and far more satisfying ""Christmas Vacation"" we've come to know and love. But if you're not an obsessive collector like myself, I highly suggest you give this a rent before spending your hard earned money purchasing this disgrace of a film. Why this was given the ""National Lampoon"" seal of approval is beyond me. If I could give this less than 1 star, I most definitely would.",0,0,0,0
R2CMXYRR8XIN0H,"Mr. Bryson may appeal to certain types, but I find no humour in his trashing of small town life in America.  Bryson finds great pleasure in seeking out the worst in every town he ""visits,"" then writes disparagingly about the inhabitants, even mocking the various dialects he encounters.  He paints a negative image of the places he visits, often perpetuating outdated stereotypes in order to make the place seem worse.  Anyone who goes looking for the worst elements of a locale will likely find them.  He then exaggerates those findings.  Such great talent has he.Mr. Bryson seems to have a rather high opinion of himself, but his writing reveals that he is actually full of himself (and full of something else).  He lived in England for a number of years apparently curing him of his American upbringing.  Now he has returned to report back to the rest of the world how bad his native country really is.His boorish exaggerations, intentional disparaging remarks, frequent use of vulgar language, and lack of any genuine interest in his subject matter (other than to sell books) leads me to believe he is a less decent form of life than any of the people he so mercilessly belittles in his book.  For all their perceived shortcomings, those people are authentic.  Bryson is a phony, and I might add, a very unattractive bloke himself.What a shame so many readers fall for his second-rate comedy.Please move back to England Bryson, and don't return.",0,0,0,0

The names of said characters are each so unique you find yourself missing the Janes and Johns of the world. But the biggest problem, the most grievous sin, is the main character Taryn.She's a foul-mouthed Mary Sue. Her devil-may-care attitude is contrived at best. But worst of all, is her one-liners.

RDDGOF6Q45STM,"I wish I waited to buy this book until after the election.  What a hateful, uneducated woman Amy is.  It's totally fine to support your candidate in the election, but what's not fine is disparaging and shaming others for their choice.  We as American citizens have a right to our vote, and no one should be shaming anyone for their choice.  As a public figure, Amy should keep her political stance to herself, because she just alienated a large portion of her fanbase.  I was a huge fan of Amy's before she started spouting out her political nonsense.  Support your candidate all you want Amy, but don't hate on others for having different views.  Remember, your fans are the reason you are as successful as you are, and that could all go away in the blink of an eye.  When it does (and it will), I'll remember the terrible things you said about human beings who dared to have a different political stance than you, and not one ounce of my being will be sad when your career comes to an end.  By the way, loved the book.  I just don't think she deserves any good reviews on it after showing the world her true colors.",0,0,0,0
R1T7GA8F3NX2QV,"Whoa!  What on earth is going on?  I own all of Whitney's previous albums, and so was looking forward to the remixes on the Greatest hits. But, to my surprise, there seems to be one 'Greatest Hits' collection for the US, and  a completely different one for the rest of the world. I have read several  other reviews where people have expressed disappointment or disgust with  the second CD that is full of remixes; my gripe is exactly the opposite:  already owning most of the material on CD2, I actually do want the remixes!  So, not living in the US, how do I get these?  I would like to give a  single finger salute to the genius at Arista who devised the idea of having  two very different 'greatest hits' collections for Whitney - there is  actually sufficient material for a real double-CD Greatest Hits album and  also a separate remix CD. This would have kept everybody happy. Well done,  bozo's. All I can say is, thank God for mp3's!",0,0,0,0
R1XVZ2YVWF9J5I,"I've had this printer for a couple of years now, and I have to say that I just hate it.  There's a lot of vitriol in this review because I'm currently once again having to troubleshoot some mystery problem of why it won't print.  Reasons I hate it:1 - It CONSTANTLY has to be reinstalled on my PC to work because it's always sending some stupid error message.  It does the same crap on my fiance's PC too, so it's not on the computer end as far as I can tell.  Usually this is after a power blink when the wi-fi resets.  Maybe it has less problems if it's hooked up via USB, but then, why buy a wi-fi printer?2 - You absolutely can't print ANYTHING, even black and white documents, if any of the other color cartridges are out of ink.  You have to keep this thing fully supplied with all types of ink for it to function.  What a scam.3 - The print quality is not great, and there are no options to increase the quality.  I mainly use this print out a lot of science journal articles for school, and the letters and diagrams are usually fuzzy.Sorry this review is a bit rage-y, but if you choose to buy this overpriced hunk of junk and use it for a while, you will understand.",0,0,0,0

R27L53X89JGWCO,"I went ahead with an order for these peanuts though I was a bit concerned about one reviewer indicating he had received considerably less than advertised.  The order arrived quickly and I was very pleasantly surprised about the shipping.  Rather than being in a bag they were in a sturdy cardboard box.  The external size of the box was four cubic feet and it was jammed packed full of the peanuts.  Making allowance for the inside dimensions of the box, I still received a bit more than the 3.5 cubic feet indicated - there was definitely not a shortage.  Although the order said the seller's name was Bubblefast, the return address on the shipping label said TheBoxery.  Not sure what that means, but it might mean some regional affiliations to reduce shipping costs.  I live near Philadelphia and the shipping point was Ridgewood, NY.  Others in different regions may not receive the same type of package.Incidentally, I priced peanuts at a local office products store and they were over 2.5 times the cost.The above order was placed Nov-2013 and was definitely a five star experience, which is what I rated it at the time.  I placed a second order April-2014 supposedly for the same thing.  However, things were not the same.  This time a company called Starboxes filled the order from somewhere in Florida.  The package only contained 2-1/2 cubic feet instead of the 3-1/2 that was ordered.  And, that package was a flimsy bag instead of a sturdy box.  Because of the shortage, I changed the rating from five stars to one star.  I find it totally unacceptable for the order to be short by almost 30%.As a follow up note to the second purchase, I complained to the seller.  It took a several emails back and forth plus a picture of the bag as received, but they agreed to refund the prorata share for the missing amount.  The person I exchanged emails with stated that the picture showed the bag had come open at the top and some had spilled out.  I am a bit doubtful about that because adding another cubic foot to that bag probably would not allow it to be closed.As a result of the refund, I have upgraded my rating to two stars.  I at least got what I paid for on a unit basis, but the process of getting there was unsatisfactory.",0,0,0,0

I am saddened to reveal that I share the views of the many who reviewed this book since print-And I adore this woman- but how could she be so delusional and misleading.From the babies to her ode to sing, sing, and sing, I did nothing but shake my head in sympathy that such a talented woman can be caught up in such a state of confusion and denial.She seems to offer no remorse to her family for her behaviors, especially after they appearingly raised her children in her absence. She speaks very little of the children and does not even offer the reader a glimpse of their faces. I was a bit saddened for her, as it appears that she still has not dealt with the desertion and eath of her mother, which she tries poorly to write off as a lie. Her not being reared by  her mother, however, clearly explains her relationship with women. She is a tad cruel and condescending towards her sisters, acting as if they were always trying to take from her or begrudge her. And when she finished with them, she moved onto the cousin. I am sure they could write a pretty memoir on her, as well.I mean, this attitude that eludes from this book, I sincerely hope this is not the real Aretha, for if it is, I truly feel sorry for her and everybody around her.I really wish I had held my ground and never read this memoir. For all you others out there who truly love this woman, this is not the book to read.p.s. However, Aretha Girl, I want to give you a bravo for romancing Dennis Edwards.

R3EKCLO625Q7TZ,"The bulbs are not silent, there is a soft but audible hum / buzz when they are on. This may be more noticeable for us because we have 5 bulbs in a fixture over our kitchen table, so there are multiple bulbs about 4' away from our heads. But the sound is quite noticeable and annoying, enough that I will probably replace these with a different brand.As a test I removed bulbs so only 1 was left. I can still hear the single bulb when 4' away but it is quieter of course; with a single bulb I think it's a problem only if you will be near the bulb and tend to be annoyed by mysterious buzz sounds!It's too bad because otherwise the bulbs are great -- nice light quality and color. I would give 5 stars if not for the noise.UPDATE: After several days the buzzing was too annoying, so I replaced these with Philips 455741 which are completely silent. The Phillips bulbs cost slightly more but given how long LED bulbs last I literally may hear this for the rest of my life; seems worthwhile.",0,0,0,0
RW469ZELEVA7B,"I was dissappointed when I received this laptop stand for several reasons...1) The other reviews are absolutely true that the attached light is totally weak and useless, the plastic this stand is made of is cheap and flimsy, and with the legs fully extended, this stand will topple over at the slightest bump because the ends are rounded and barely touching the surface.2) If you are pear-shaped and full-figured like myself (size 22)or even if you are just very muscular with thick thighs, this laptop will not fit you with the legs extended to the ""first"" position. The hard, rough-edged bottom of the stand winds up digging into your legs, scratching you up and sitting crooked on your lap. In order for you to use it, you have to fully extend the legs out to its last position. This makes the laptop stand too high up to type comfortably unless you lift the split top up to tilt the laptop towards you. Which leads me to the next issue...3) The split top is held up by a single plastic piece (on one side only) that you slide into plastic slots to raise it to different angles (functioning silimilarly like a car hood).  Problem is, this plastic piece is flimsy and your laptop wobbles with every keystroke that you type.  Also, the split top is barely wide enough to fit a 15-inch laptop.  If you have a 17-inch laptop...forget about it! Your laptop won't even stay on the stand in ""split top mode"".Overall, I gave this 2 stars only because for the right sized person, with the right sized laptop or netbook, this stand could be worth it for the price. Otherwise, I wouldn't bother paying for this. You would come out just as good buying a $10 breakfast tray.",0,0,0,0

This was recorded while John Lennon was dating May Pang and suddenly one of the songs he wrote about loving May now has the words ""Yo-Ko"" chanting in the background.

RKEK0LKN87RM9,"Who is this ""Jee-Sauce"" that this man with strange pacing and pronunciation is reading to me about?Seriously, who honestly thinks this is as good a reading as the grossly exaggerated review by Donald Whitney- excerpted by the seller in the product description -expects us to believe? It's certainly not the worst, most ridiculous, or hamy reading I've ever heard, but this reading by no means ""sounds as you might expect the writers of the text to sound if they were speaking instead of writing."" as Whitney pretends.In his full review (not cited in the Amazon product description), Mr. Whitney is right to point out how good his reading of Peter in Acts 2 is, but he neglects to mention that everything he says as the narrator on the way to Peter speaking is rushed word vomit: ""WhenthedayofPenticostcame. ... Theywerealltogetherinoneplace. ... Suddenlyasoundliketheblowingofaviolentwindcamefromheavenandfilledthewholehousewheretheyweresitting. ..."" and so on. Remember, in the gospels and in Acts, it's not people who speak most often but the narrator. If you have an actor who can't play the narrator well in such a production, you've got a massive problem.Contra Mr. Whitney and AudioFile Magazine's reviews, McLean very much ""sounds like he's reading"" and usually doesn't read in a way ""which sweeps the listener into the heart of the Word of God"". That's so much marketing nonsense.His reading is strange and stilted. He has difficulty distinguishing voices. He has difficulty speaking the words in an effective way. His diction is sometimes bizarre. He has difficulty reading in different styles to suit the text. He's very very bad, for example, when you're reading a narrative where two or more people are talking. Often, you'll hear something like...""Blah blah blah."" said Judas. ""Blah blah blah."" Said Jesus in reply....and McLean for whatever reason just can't make Judas, Jesus, and the narrative voice distinct. He hardly even tries. I would prefer different silly voices to just having the same voice for every person in the bible.These are terrible flaws in an audio book reader and, indeed, in any actor putting on a one-man production of a multi-character text.I mean, it's not unlistenable, but I'm not choosing an audio bible just to have it on so that I can feel good about myself. The bible is not background noise or casual entertainment! I'm trying to find a tool that will facilitate my being able to learn and retain the text. Let's be honest. That's not going to happen with this odd little reading. I'm going to tune this thing out in 20 minutes at the most.Look, the bible is very long, and I've not made it through the entire CD. I listened to key and familiar parts of the Old and New Testament as well as parts of the CD reviewed by other reviewers to see how it stood up for me and how the other reviews compared to my own experience. Maybe there are parts that are much better, but I found it lacking as a performance for reasons that are plainly obvious and which could have beeneasily fixed.I blame the director first, the actor second, and the translator of the text third. The actor should have been aware of his performance. The director should have made him aware. And the translator should have given them a better script to perform.I know that good recordings of old Greek texts in translation can be done. Homer, Plato, and many of the Greek tragedies have been done superbly, but I haven't found an audio bible yet that isn't more than a hamy third-rate production from a hamy third rate actor. Maybe the problem is that we translate Homer to be heard and read and the bible to be ""accurate"" (We might say that our New Testament translation are so ""accurate"" that they read dismally in comparison to the original Greek).At any rate, this is where I would normally tell you all to take your $33 elsewhere, but since I don't know a recording that lives up to some of the very best audio books I've heard, I don't know where to send you. The bible deserves to be treated as well as Recorded books and Rob Inglis treated The Lord of the Rings in  The Lord of the Rings Trilogy Gift Set  and Penguin Audio and Sir Ian McKellen treated Homer's Odyssey in  The Odyssey .There is no reason a Christian production company shouldn't be able to produce something as good if not better than these other companies. It's not for lack of funding; the faithful practically throw money at these people. And it's not for lack of ability. The small Christian audio book company Hovel Audio put out a fine production of Augustine's Confessions in  The Confessions of Saint Augustine , and their translation of that text was far worse for reading aloud than the translation of the bible used for this recording!Please, people, don't transfer your reverence for the bible onto just anyone who does the work of doing a recording of it. That alone isn't worth all these positive reviews. This production is terrible in most places I've listened to it, and anyone that charges you $33 for a terrible production with bad to mediocre acting marketing it with hand-picked reviews that call it a great production with fantastic acting is cheating you.If anyone has any suggestions for better recordings of the bible please feel free to comment on this review. If I find I like the product I'll edit them into the review so that it's not a totally negative piece. I hate to leave you all with nowhere to turn, but I'm lost in a wilderness of terrible recordings.",1,1,0,1

R2BWX7MYT4PDRG,"Good Music, good actors, even some good snotty remarks.1 star to counter all the people who weren't really paying attentionJuno stomps thru this movie like some alterna-Disney princess. She does whatever she wants, says whatever she wants and no one really stands in her way(her step-mother offers the only resistance, however limply). Juno's a rotten little twit.What I really didn't like was the ominous feeling that the film was going to try to turn around and give her a sympathetic makeover. Sure enough. After spending most of the film being rude to everyone and getting her way she can't handle it when one of the other characters finally peels himself off the background and does something she doesn't like. Now she's fragile and emotional...doesn't stop her from continuing being rude though.The only sweet moments are when Juno's mouth is shut and the soundtrack comes to the front. It felt really manipulative having such upbeat music in a movie about such a jerk.The mailbox full 'o Tic Tacs was pure insulting treacle. She treats Michael Cera's character like a cure for boredom(essentially how she got pregnant), then as an insignificant nuisance up until she the wants him back. That's where the Tic Tacs come in. Aww, she really does love him and he goes for it. Tic Tacs? If any candy fits him it's a Sucker!The biggest insult came at the end in the hospital after she's given birth.

R163VV9FIXOV9Y,"Book: This collection of stories is the first book I have read by Julian Barnes. Given his prominence, I have to say I was disappointed. The stories are competently written, but their virtues do not stretch much further than that. They are generally rambling, a disaster for a form in which it is essential that everything extraneous is removed so that a powerful and convincing narrative can be fitted into a short space. They fly off at such tangents that one often finishes a story without much idea of what it had really been about. This might be exacerbated by listening to the audio book rather than reading, but the issue is surely fundamental to the writing.The first story ('East Wind') is probably the strongest - a story of a brief romance between a divorced estate agent and a foreign waitress, destroyed by the man's stupidity. It sets the tone suitably enough for a collection of stories steeped in British (middle-aged) middle-class mores: gardening, walking, divorce, dinner parties, and dying parents. In the case of this first story, the stupidity is understandable. At other points, the characters' idiocy is so extreme that it is almost baffling. One ""discovers"" that PH is a measure of acidity/alkalinity. Another persistently asks what the difference between a simile and a metaphor is.The biggest problem, though, is hollowness. One has a vague sense that some of the issues dealt with here might be close to the author's own experience, and that for this reason he finds their interest and importance self-evident, while the poor reader wonders just what the point is of what they are reading. The title story (also the last) is a dreary tale of a failed marriage and a mother's death that pales in comparison to (to take just one example) Colm Toibin's affecting treatment of a parent's death in 'One Minus One', the first story of his recent collection The Empty Family.In general, this is a dull book composed of competent but uninteresting stories. Were I not reviewing it, I would have struggled to carry on much further than the half-way point.Audio book: Well-produced, and well read.",0,0,0,0

It's leaning, and everything is loose and falling apart. I followed the instructions on how to put it together but it is just a piece of garbage! The parts they provide dont even all fit together! i had to get a refund! DO NOT BUY THIS THING!!!!My mom ordered this unit of drawers, and instead what came was a box of WOOD AND NAILS! You literally have to BUILD THIS THING from scratch! The only thing you don't have to do is chop down the tree and cut the wood. I had a good mind to send this back but i didnt want to disappoint my mom because she really wanted this thing. I am not a carpenter! I do not have power tools and this does not come with any tools!It's not one of those ""some assembly required"" type things. Its a YOU NEED TO BUILD THIS type things! You need a regular hammer, one of those rubber hammers and a phillips head screw driver at the very least. That's what I used. But honestly you need POWER TOOLS! An electric drill! a nail gun! this thing was A NIGHTMARE! it took me 4 hours to put together. i think it would have taken 2 if i had the power tools!The back panel had a big gash taken out of it on arrival. There are certain pieces of wood that require a screw to go into it but there is no HOLE for the screw! you have to make it yourself! so some of mine went in crooked and came out on the other side of the wood leaving holes and chips! THIS SUCKS!!!Also, the little wood pieces they give you that youre supposed to stick into it to connect pieces of wood together were TOO SMALL! so they werent secure in the holes which caused the wood to connect loosely! this thing is not secure. I guess i have to add glue or something! In some places it was hard to hammer the nail in even though it said a nail was supposed to go there! I guess i need a NAIL GUN! ALSO IT DIDNT COME WITH ENOUGH NAILS SO I HAD TO GO TO THE STORE AND BUY SOME!The least they could have done was partially assembled it! i had to put every piece together and build every drawer! I feel like i should get some kind of carpentry certificate after that! I feel like i should have gotten paid to do this work! definitely was not worthit!THIS THING WAS A NIGHTMARE! I WILL NEVER BUY FROM THIS COMPANY AGAIN!!! I WANT MY MONEY BACK OR AT LEAST SOME OF IT!

R2LDRD5ZLWNKAR,"On the plus side, the author, Bill Bryson, has a crisp, fast-moving writing style, with an easy-to-follow organization.On the minus side, Bryson expresses vile thoughts, ugly assertions and even uses the diseases of others for cheap humor.Bryson’s writing is crass. The high point of his humor is a daydream to be some woman’s hero and thereby gain leverage over her, and force her to strip naked.In short, his writing is sickening.I was drawn to this book by a quote from this book that describing the ideal small town. That quote was used in another text, but peaked my interest in this book. That quote was perhaps the only non-vulgar image in the text. I would have stopped after 50 pages, but mistakenly suspected the author would arrive at some redeeming epiphany and reverse his disgusting mockery of all the people he met and all the places he went during the trip. I was wrong.The author saw two Americas: the countryside with fat, stupid folk, who can’t enunciate intelligibly in English, and the cities filled with fat, stupid folk, who are lonely and isolated, despite living in a high-density area. Bryson has a keen eye for spotting fat women, particularly ugly, fat women --everywhere he went.  In short, the tone of this book is that of an adolescent teen taking a first road trip, except without a pack of friends with whom to share the sophomoric, and insipid invectives.It is also superficial. The book takes a shallow view of practically every site visited. Each stop evoked a few comments about some historical prejudice, greed, racism, more fat women, or poverty. Bryson drives to another city and repeats the formula --again and again.At the end of the book, the total value of Bryson’s effort is delivered as nothing more than a realization that he had driven in 38 states and driven 13,978 miles.  All that sarcasm, rudeness, and crassness ended in a mileage count!The book was as shallow in conclusion as it was in content.If you like insulting, snide, sophomoric humor –and being including on “the inside” for jokes made at others’ expense, then this is the book for you.

RDGU06AENZYX,"Wow, this movie started out good with beautiful visuals and depictions of tornados and floods and then... So, I said that the first 30 minutes were good, and then the rest of the movie was absolutely horrid. Well, the movie's about a scientist that think that the world is going to come into a new ice age. Of course, this happens, and when there are terrible floods in New York, he decides to go with 2 co workers to save his son who's there. It's absolutely freezing out and while the other 2 die, the dad played by Dennis Quaid of course survives. I mean, what the heck was Roland Emmerich thinking? Yeah, like a human would survive in such atrocious weather conditions. Sure, Dennis Quaid isn't cold at all and he just keeps on walking for like 1000000000000000 miles and saves his son. This movie is absolutely terrible and movies stupid like this are always the huge blockbusters while the best movies ever don't win close to this one's box office results.

R3NXNI6KADTMCU,"I have a lot to say about Stephen King's ""Christine"".  Unfortunately, most of it is negative.  Like many of King's books, I was drawn into the novel as soon as I opened it.  Within the first 50 pages the reader is introduced to a handful of well developed, interesting characters, and an intriguing plot begins to build.  It isn't until the last 150 pages or so that it starts to go downhill.  And once it starts to go downhill, the story continues to suffer right up to the very last page.  I can't say much more without ruining the book for those who haven't read it yet, so from here on in my review will be full of spoilers.**SPOILERS**I had some major gripes with this book, and I'm not even sure where to start.  The most obvious problem was that be book was simply too wordy.  This is one of King's trademarks and I knew this going in, so I guess it's kind of a moot point.  Another thing that bothered me was the general format.  I understand that it was supposed to be a memoir told from the first person perspective, but what about the middle of the book where it's told from the third person?  It reveals things that Dennis couldn't possibly know and would leave a significant gap in his story if anyone were to read it.  I guess that's why King told the second part of the novel from a third person perspective, but it makes the overall format inconsistent and prevents story from flowing naturally.My biggest problem with this book was Christine.  The novel's title is ""Christine"" and throughout the book the reader is led to believe that the car itself is evil.  It isn't until toward the end of the novel that the reader finally figures out (and this point was never made entirely clear) that Christine isn't evil, nor is she even all that important.  The driving force behind the car (and the true source of evil) is LeBay.  So if Christine doesn't have a persona of her own, what's the point of giving it a name and a gender?  If the car isn't even important, why is it the title of the book?  It could have been an interesting plot twist of handled correctly, but the issue is never explicitly addressed.  Left as it is, it misleads the reader and is ultimately self defeating.When we first meet LeBay, he's a grumpy old war veteran with a taste for bigotry and a mouth as foul as a sewer.  He sells his rusty old car to Arnie (who is inexplicably drawn to it) and he laughs evilly after making the transaction.  So what would this lead the average horror fan to believe?  It would seem logical that the car is possessed and had brought great misfortune to LeBay.  When Arnie is suddenly drawn to the car it's because the car has chosen a new victim.  LeBay realizes that he can finally be free of the cursed car and relinquishes it to its new victim.  Stereotypical?  Yes, but it works.  Unfortunately this is not how the story plays out.  And as a result, it leaves the reader with a lot of unanswered questions.If the car wasn't possessed in and of itself, then what was it that made Arnie want it so badly?  And what exactly went through LeBay's mind when he sold Arnie the car and began to laugh? ""I'll die as soon as I sell this car only to be reincarnated in the form of ghost and possess the car in order to... um... I guess I'll figure it out when I get there...""  Does this make any sense to you?  If you think about it, this is what must have happened.Setting aside the absurd concept of LeBay knowing that he would die and possess the car, what exactly was his motivation?  Normally when we read books about evil characters who die only to continue their evil after death, it's for a specific purpose.  In most cases it's because they have unfinished business (usually in the form of revenge that has yet to be issued).  From what I can tell, LeBay just wanted to continue to be a jerk from beyond the grave.  What kind of motivation is that?  I'm not buying it.Another thing that bothered me was Dennis's plan to get rid of Christine.  After brainstorming with Leigh he has a brilliant revelation that is hidden from the reader until the very end of the book.  And his incredible plan is to... beat the living crap out of it?  I'm pretty sure he realized that every time Christine received a blow she was able to heal herself, so why would his plan be any different?And then when Christine is compacted into a cube and Dennis has finally moved on, years later he discovers that one of the kids who helped mess up the car about half-way through the book is mysteriously killed... by a car.  Now, Dennis makes a casual connection that it may be Christine, and points out the possibility that it could be after him and Leigh next, but not only does he not sound particularly concerned about it, he basically says that the story is over.  It's clear as day to the reader that Christine had finally recovered and was, in fact, continuing her mission to kill everyone who crossed her.  How could he not know that, and how could he not even care?  If not for himself, he should at least have been afraid for Leigh (for whom he still had romantic feelings for despite the fact that she was married).  And what does he do in response to this news?  He ends the story.  Seriously, what the Hell?Yet another point to add to the list was the fact that Arnie died.  Dennis nearly gets himself killed for one main goal: kill Christine in order to save Arnie.  He successfully kills Christine (or so he thought at the time) and Arnie dies anyway!  And what's worse is that it was never made quite clear how this even happened.  Dennis hypothesized that when Christine was getting creamed, LeBay retreated back to Arnie's body... and then he and his mother died in a car accident.  I guess I can kind of see it, but it desperately needs clarification.And I just don't understand why Arnie had to die.  Don't get me wrong, it's not that I don't like it when main characters die in books, it's just that death should add depth to the story.  In this case, it simply doesn't.  To me it seems like it was only thrown in for shock value, while failing to add any real value to the book.  I generally don't like happy endings in horror novels, but I felt like this story could have gotten away with it.I could go on, but this review is too long as it is.  In a nutshell, this book severely lacks something that most Stephen King books are overflowing with: Explanation.  Reminiscent of King's ""The Dark Half"", ""Christine"" never really reveals the true origin of the evil force, nor does it even give enough clues to begin to form a larger picture.  As a result, the leader is left scratching his or her head thinking, ""What just happened?""It's a real shame.  This could have been an excellent story.",0,0,0,0

R3USXNOVG5P3K4,"In ""The Beach House"" we're given Jack Mullen, a 2nd year law student and summer intern with one of New York's most prestigious law firms.  The book opens with Mullen's impulsive and irresponsible younger brother, Peter, working as a parking valet at the annual summer party of a well-known billionaire.  Peter is lured away from his duties to the nearby beach, where he's shot and his death covered up to look like a drowning.  It's up to his older brother, Jack, to find out what really happened that night and make sure that Peter's killer comes to justice.Sounds innocuous enough, but the way Mullen eventually decides to get justice was not just implausible, it was utterly ridiculous.  It was almost as though Patterson consulted with the local 6th grade class to come up with an ending.  Yeah, it was that hokey.On a positive note, the presence of De Jonge as a co-author was discernable here.  The writing was actually a bit better than the last few solo Patterson novels - not necessarily in terms of plot, dialog, or character depth, but in terms of some original metaphors and turns of phrases.  They seemed like they were coming from fresh blood, and I'm assuming De Jonge was responsible for that.Also, although devoting the prologue or first chapter to the events of the murder in a mystery/thriller novel is nothing new, it was a bit of a twist to do this in first person narrative format using the voice of the murder victim himself.Having read nearly a dozen Patterson novels now, and having reviewed several of them here on Amazon, a disappointing trend has emerged with this author.  With Patterson churning out 5-6 novels a year now, it definitely shows in declining quality.  Nobody can be that prolific without having to skimp on ingredients.  Even the typography in these books is repetitive, along with the annoyingly short 2-3 page chapters.  Bottom line: I can't escape the feeling that I'm being served fiction from a drive through window.  About the only thing missing is a tinny speaker and the words ""Do you want fries with that?""From a larger perspective, Patterson's books reflect an American culture that has totally lost the concept of ""moderation"" and instead insists on ""saturation.""  The end result of this ""if one is good, 20 is better"" mentality is that there ins't much good to say about quality, only quantity.  I'd be much happier with one decent book a year from this author rather than the half a dozen mediocre ones that he feels compelled to crank out.",0,0,0,0

RDY9305ARW6P6,"Review of free Kindle editionASIN: B0083ZRQR4124 pagesI have long considered FLATLAND to be an overrated mostly boring book.  However it is supposed to be a classic, admired and enjoyed by many people some of whom are considered to be or consider themselves to be intellectuals.  So I thought, maybe it's me.  Maybe a deficiency in my ability to grasp the fine qualities of the book prevents me from understanding how great it is.  Then I read a passage about FLATLAND  from THE POT THIEF WHO STUDIED EDWARD ABBEY by J. Michael Orenduff.  Orenduff, a former college professor with his PhD in Mathematical Logic, a former university president and chancellor is now a full-time author known mainly for writing the Pot Thief Mystery Series.  He should understand FLATLAND as a mathematician and as an author.  Here is what his characters say about FLATLAND:“All work is 3-D,” said Martin.We stared at him.He looked at me. “Remember that book Flatland you made me read?”“I didn’t make you read it.”“When a white college student visits a fourteen-year-old dropout on the rez and suggests a book, that’s the same as making me read it.”“But you liked it, right?”“Yeah, because it made me feel smarter than the guy who wrote it.”“How so?” asked Sharice.“He says the men who live in Flatland are polygons. The fewer sides a man has, the lower he is on the social scale. So triangles are the lowest level, squares are higher, pentagons higher and so on. But he also says they can see each other and interact, which is impossible. Because if they were truly two-dimensional, they would have no sides, so there would be nothing to see.”“You could see them from the top,” said Susannah, “and from that vantage point, you could also see how many sides they have.”“No. To see them from on top, you’d have to be above them. But there is no up in Flatland. And there is no down. There is only north, south, east and west. So they wouldn’t even know other men existed.”“They would when they bumped into them,” she said.He shook his head and placed two pennies on the table, sliding them until they touched. “These pennies can bump into each other because they have sides. But imagine them without sides. I don’t mean just really flat. I mean no side dimension at all. The men in Flatland can’t bump into each other because they have no sides.”“Why do you keep calling them men?  Aren’t there women in Flatland?”“Sure. The author says they are straight lines.”She shook her head. “Sheesh. I might have guessed.  The women are the lowest life-forms because they have only one dimension.”“Right. And he makes the same sort of mistake in describing them, saying that seen from straight-on they look like a point.  But you can’t see the end of a line because that would require that it have some height.  Lines have only length. You could see them from below or above but not in a world that has only two dimensions.”“He says something else about women,” I noted. “Because of their lack of intelligence, they accidentally pierce and kill people without even knowing it. But ten minutes later they can’t remember it happening.”Sharice stared at me. “And you made him read that?”“For the math part.  I knew he was smart enough not to believe the stuff about women.”“He was also smart enough not to believe the stuff about math. A guy who thinks you can see something that doesn’t have sides …wait, they can’t see anything anyway. If they had eyes, they would have to be on their surface, because they have no sides. So the only direction their eyes could look would be up. But there is no up.”“See,”I said, trying to move beyond my having forced a misogynist book on Martin, “You’re also smarter than the author.”I agree with Mr. Orenduff and his fictional characters.

R2P88IPHQBSV79,"This is the 2nd BRAND compatible Toner I have purchased & received in this Month of August 2022.  I returned the other brand a week ago because the print quality was only FAIR and NOT Good compared to the existing toner cartridge that I was replacing it with.  The older toner cartridge was a compatible I purchased from Amazon in Sept of 2020 and it was still much crisper, darker and clearer than both the other  brand and this V4INK brand that I am writing about.  It seems to me that both recently received remanufactured toner cartridges (both are 2-pack) are being refilled with less quality toner material or maybe it's just LESS TONER in the cartridges.  Because of ""frustration"" I have decided to keep the V4INK cartridges rather than returning them as I did the other brand recently, just to try it out longer time to see if the print quality improves.  Amazon does stand behind these products, and I appreciate the quick response of a refund for the other brand this past week, but I am very disappointed to have the same thing happen with this 2nd choice compatible toner cartridge.

Getting those new holes into correct place may be tricky, but doable if you know your way with tools and such.I was in impression that this would allow you to hang the TV in almost any height you want, but that was not the case. It will put the TV quite high from the ground. Again, you can drill new holes to the support booms and have it your way.That glass plate cannot handle much more than 4 lbs (roughly 2 kg).

R1D9WST6Z2PR7M,"I have bought and used two of these in a row for our small office. I love the features and see it as a GREAT unit with one crippling flaw. The printheads always end up clogging and producing unusable results from that time forward. I have never put anything but Epson ink in both units. Also, it gets used every day, seven days a week so it never sits for long periods of time without printing. Once the heads clog, running the cleaning cycle over and over does nothing, aligning the heads does nothing, replacing the ink cartridges does nothing. I now have regularly-spaced horizontal banding and smears on the text. The first printer went 1 1/2 years before the printhead clogged. The latest one went only 3 months.

R2HZVD44NQF8BI,"Overall this book was okay. I really enjoyed some of Frances' observations and was interested in her background (especially her relationship with her parents) but I strongly disliked the romance element. In a previous review for Normal People (which I really enjoyed and revisit frequently) I noted that when I read the book as a romance, I walked away disappointed, but when I read the book as a social commentary, I found a lot of respect for the characters and the unique intricacies of their relationships that made the story far more engaging and rewarding. When it comes to Conversations with Friends however, even when I tried to put aside the romance element of the story, I just couldn't keep myself from judging the characters and cringing at the entire affair.  I don't think that I was supposed to be rooting for them or enjoying the relationship, like, I get that it is a complicated and borderline problematic yet realistically portrayed relationship, but unlike Connell and Marianne in Normal People, I just couldn't relate and/or understand what was going on w Nick and Frances.As a reader, I've learned hyper-realistic and incredibly intimate stories about difficult and uncomfortable relationships (particularly where there is a significant difference age and/or power between the characters) are just not my cup of tea. Overall, unlike some books of this nature that I've read in the past, I just didn't see the social commentary or the point that Sally Rooney was trying to make with these characters. It's entirely possible that I'm not meant to ~get it~ or that somebody else would understand this story a lot better than me. Overall, I may pick this book up again and I recommend giving it a go if you like stories like ""Luster"" by Raven Leilani or ""The Seas"" by Samantha Hunt, but it wasn't much of an enjoyable read for me.",0,0,0,0

RJOD5ITAY6SOF,"No cute intros here, I need to get right down to brass tacks.  Many of my faithful followers have practically begged me to write this review.  I hope I don't disappoint (which - burn number one - this movie most certainly did).This is probably (burn number two) the most shallow look at race relations in the U.S. ever to be taken seriously.  I realize that there are many white liberals in this country that love to be reminded of how ""inherently racist"" they are.  This whitey doesn't accept that.  Many of my black, Indian, and East Asian friends have dubbed me an ""honorary woman of color,"" which is one of my proudest achievements.  I've earned it.  The makers of ""Crash"" (burn number three) wouldn't know how to fit me into their trite, contrived view of America.In a movie full of stereotypes, I think the characters played by Ludacris and Lorenz Tate really take the cake.  It's almost like (burn number four) they are supposed to represent a socially-conscious modern day black Abbott and Costello.  Where do people like this exist in reality?  They don't.  When Ludacris sets those illegals free, it is meant to be seen as a moment of redemption but in reality is a crime that deserves punishment.Some of the characters are not even racist.  Take Sandra Bullock's character for instance - she's not racist, just not very respectful of anyone regardless of race.  She's mean to everyone, therefore no one likes her.  And the Persian shopkeeper?  He's not so much a racist - he's just a stupid, distrustful moron.  Yet (burn number five) the movie strains to earn the audience's sympathy for these total jerks.Much like other unmitigated disasters such as ""Magnolia,"" this movie follows many story segments - with the various characters' lives occasionally criss-crossing one another.  The unifying events that tie all the characters together (final burn) are strained, forced, far too coincidental, and ultimately unconvincing.",0,0,0,0
R261WU0RWNLW58,"I'm sure many of you have read the reviews. And watched Dr. Oz. If you noticed in the show and the reviews NOBODY is losing 20 lbs. on this diet.

If you follow her meals you'll be eating so many darn cucumbers you don't need the water.

But since I wanted to know if I could eat this way and only exercise three times a week I stuck to it. Guess what?

R2763TO0VJEOLB,"While these labels (and numerous similar ones in other sizes) are very useful around the house, a design change in the last year or two has added a fatal flaw. Previously, the labels had an overprinted border so you could see where the label stopped and the background paper started. Now, probably;as a cost-cutting measure, the individual labels no longer have a printed border. As a result, it's very difficult to tell whether you're writing on the label or the background paper. I've wasted I don't know how many labels by going off the label and writing on the background. It helps to fold the label along the border edges  so you can see where the label stops, but even this doesn't always solve the problem. It's really too bad, because the older labels really deserved five stars, but without the printed border, the labels are much more difficult to use, imho. Also, Avery has by far the largest piece of the removable label business; the only alternatives I've found are from Staples.",0,0,0,0

RNG65POMD188A,"Overall, I found this book to be scripted and cliche'.  The teacher only seems to get asked questions to which he has the answers.  The individual characters seem like charicatures.  I find the way in which they all become equally enlighted at the of the story to feel really fake.That said, this book has some really good points.  Most of them borrowed from others who have said it better and simply regurgitated here using narrative format with very simple language.  Personally, I have found the greatest success (there have been few for me as a leader) when I have placed myself in the service of others.  It is also helpful in understanding the need to meet peoples needs rather than just their wants.  Good things to say about bounderies, integrity, and so on.However, I really must take issue with a number of the points the book makes.PG 32-33All employees are volunteers of sorts.  They can freely choose to work where they want.  They can freely choose when to leave.Well that ain't really so.  Last time I checked there were a number of factors that limit our choices i.e. education, age, geography, physical/mental capabilities, and so on.  This book is a big proponent of free choice and a critic of determinism.  Not surprising given its basis in evangelical thinking.  They even site Frankl on matter of free choice later in the book.  Fact is yes, we have choices but there are limitations on those choices.  This is not a bad thing, it just is.So basically, some folks stay in bad jobs because they need the money for food, rent, and gas.  That can put them at a disadvantage when it comes to their relationship with their employer.  Do not forget the power that money can yield in this society especially when you have limited sources of it.  In many cases, the employer still holds a lot of the cards.  Consider the children in developing nations that sew our childrens soccer balls together.PG 43-44Money ranks #4 among what employees want.Money still ranks and frankly it is a function of being treated with dignity and respect.  Our financial compensation is based on how much value we create financially but it is also a reflection of how much value is placed on us.  Consider the child mentioned above.  Consider how much money he makes and then consider the profits of the soccer ball company.  Consider the compensation of the CEO for that soccer ball company.  Consider that workers wages have consistently declined while executive compensations and corporate profits have soared.PG 120Throw-away societyNo doubt we are a throw-away society and perhaps I am the worst offender in this regard.  But I find the use of abortion to support this point to be problematic.There is a comment here suggests that the decision to have an abortion is as simple and easy as tossing away something unwanted.  There are so many points to be made against this that I am not sure where to begin.  But I will end here, this is a difficult decision for any person or couple to make.  If they are pro-life (that's right folks pro-life people have abortions) or if they are pro-choice, it is a emotional, serious, and tough choice to make.  It is even tougher to follow through with.  I would be naive if I did not say that there are people who are flipant about this decision but that is extremely rare.  The vast majority of people make such a significant decision carefully and thoughtfully.Perhaps a better example, one that is never touched on very strongly, is the amount of resources that we use compared to our population.  Not sure the exact percentages here but in the USA we consume a large portion of the available resources relative to our population.  How about those gianormous SUVs we see crusing around the burbs?  You know the ones that get about 10 miles to the gallon?  I could be wrong here but their sole purpose seems to be to prop up the ego. Is that not wasting resources?  The take more material to manufacture, utilize, and maintian than cars 1/2 to 1/3 their size.  If the purpose of a vehicle is to get us and our gear from point A to point B AND a smaller vehicle will do the job, then isn't any vehicle larger than that in effect a waste?  Is that not simply throwing away resources that could be better used elsewhere?  Wouldn't our world be better served by a more wise use of our resources?  How about applying servanthood in this context?PG 153Smokers blame cigarette companies to their addiction.For the most part, I have to agree with the book on this one but fact is the cigarette companies deliberately manipulated nicotine levels so as to maxmize the chances for the smokers addiction.  Yes, everyone who put that first cigarette in their mouth made that choice freely AND there are plenty of people who struggled with the difficulty of quitting to shake the habit.  So we know it can be done.  But the fact is, the cigarette companies stacked the deck...or pack...in their favor to intentionally addict users and ensure a continued market for their product.  They even went so far to create cartoon characters to market their product so as to get young people to smoke.  Here again, coupled with nicotine levels intended to produce addiction, they ensure a stable and reliable market for their products and profits.  All this while internal documents clearly and directly link their product to cancer and heart diesease.  Were it not for these actions, the books point would have been stronger.If we are talking about being servants here then where is the service in the cigarette companies actions?  Where is their responsiblity?  There is a subtle message here that corporations are not to blame for the impact of their actions.  Why isn't the notion of responsibilty that is applied to individuals also leveled at corporations?PG 154The Twinkie DefenseThis is simply a bad example.  The so called Twinkie Defense was hyped by the media to grab the public's attention and create ratings.  If you take about 10 seconds to drill down into the issue, you would find that the legal defense of Dan White based based on a bi-polar disease and not twinkies.  Twinkies were simply evidence supporting an overall defense based upon mental illness.  And from what little I know, the guy was definately whacked.  He should be held responsible but still he was whacked out.My point is this.  As a casual observer of the news, we can have these sort of knee-jerk reactions and comments.  As a published author, one has a greater responsibility to get their story straight.  Otherwise, we simply perpetuate a half-baked understanding of the facts.  Where is the servant in that?Okay, I am off my soap box.",0,0,0,0

The unit was inadequate for carpet over a matt on concrete which we have in the Southwest. I kept applying reasonable pressure and the unit was not cutting the binding portion of the carpet well at all. I used my own template that I created with a knife guide in it and that did a beautiful job. I did use the sticky pads and they were excellent. That is why I gave the rating of two stars. I would not recommend for anyone with a concrete subfloor!,0,0,0,0
RW6INZHJCISLK,"The media could not be loaded.                      I read the negative reviews about the tape cutter being dull etc. and thought “how bad could it be?” Unfortunately they weren’t nitpicking, it is bad. It’s difficult to cut the tape and when you do, the remaining tape doesn’t stick to the cutter, it falls inside and sticks to the bottom. The cutting blade sticks straight up (the cutter on the tape dispenser I currently use sticks out with a flat portion on top before the blade) so I thought maybe if I bent the cutter forward, the remaining tape would have something to stick to. Nope again. Also, the sides of the organizer stick up so high that you can’t easily grab the tape to pull and cut, you have to slide your finger inside between the tape and the wall, which isn’t convenient. If you don’t do it right, you’ll push the tape off the cutter and down into the organizer again. The cutting blade isn’t secure in the unit either and can easily slide in or out. Should (hopefully) be able to secure it by clamping it with needle nose pliers. The metal is also pretty flimsy and bends easily, so one of the sorting slots was crooked when it arrived. The good thing about it being flimsy is that it was easy to bend the sorter back up. I'm honestly disappointed because I already have things to do what this organizer does (tape dispenser, pen holder, sorter etc.) but I thought this would be a perfect way to clean up my desk a bit.",0,0,0,0

RBX3V543VX7Y2,"I have owned this printer for about 1 year. I have had LOTS of issues with it. Often, (usually when I am the busiest) the printer loses wifi connectivity with my computer and with my husband's tablet suggesting it's the printer rather than the device which I'm attempting to print from that is the problem. I then have to uninstall then re-install the printer. Usually this works but it is time consuming. My second issue is the cost of the ink cartridges which if I buy locally is around $50 for the set. The printer will not allow me to use anything but the Epson brand. Even when installing the Epson brand cartridges often the printer wont recognize them and continues to tell me to install more cartridges. Sometimes I have an impt work report to print and the printer just refuses to recognize the full cartridges or wont print one of the colors. I am writing this review as my only recourse to defuse my frustration. I purchased new cartridges @ $50  and couldnt get the printer to accept them, called tech support and told them the printer reads the cartridge as empty. He suggested I buy another set then call back. He had no idea what the problem could be and since Epson ""assumes"" it is operator error he did not offer a refund on the cartridges. So I would be paying $100 for a $89.99 printer with no guarantee it would print!! Well, so I decided to write this review instead.",0,0,0,0

R1U3IOIP3KTFSG,"If you like movies that have no explainable ending, then this is the movie for YOU.  This is so disappointing because there is a great plot, surprisingly great acting, and great character development.  Some people have compared this to an Agatha Christie story or even Hitchcock, but don't buy it.  Now I know some people will say that ""The Birds"" didn't explain why birds went nuts and they'd be right, but it's a great story with a satisfying ending.  But ""Don't Blink"" is more like ""Psycho"" if it ended where Norman made his last kill and no explanation of why Norman did what he did.  A group of ""adults"" go to a mountain retreat.  Not one of them decide to fill the gas tank, but just have enough to get there and a few miles back.  There are a number of MacGuffins or red herrings in this movie, but I'd rather not say it if you really plan to watch this.  Something strange is going on because there is no one else at the lodge.  There are no animal noises or any noises.  There are half-eaten meals.  You almost start to think ""Langoliers"", and that might have made sense if the writer had chosen to create a real ending.  People in the group start disappearing one by one.  There is a torture scene that really shows the character of these people.  Is it supernatural horror?  Is it Sci-Fi?  Who knows?  You won't know either.  Even after the last scene plays out.  Some movies work well when they end without a true ending, but this isn't one of them.  This movie is tense and gripping.  This is great acting and great writing, but why the writer gave up and didn't supply a REAL ending is beyond me. And more and more current movies are doing this as though they could be Hitchcock or Spielberg.  Hell, this is even devoid of a Shymalian ending. If I want to create my own ending, I'll write my own movie.  And if you think your stuff is so damn great, then tell the audience at the beginning that you don't have an explainable ending and we can decide if we want to waste our money.  And if anyone thinks this type of ending is artsy, then you need to rip out the last chapter of any book you've read or skip the last 5 minutes of any movie you've watched and see if you enjoy that.  For this reason, I cannot recommend this movie and I'd give it zero stars if allowed.",0,0,0,0

R1XFJ93Y8PW4XM,"Beyond Civilization Review Tribalism is the only way to survive!! Or so Daniel Quinn says in his series of thoughts in Beyond Civilization. Quinn places our capitalistic world in question placing great emphasis on civilization being the ruin of the world. The problem with Beyond Civilization is that it does make sense of the problems facing our civilization today, but offers no practical way of solving our dilemma. Quinn believes the solution is reverting back to the tribal way of life. Yes, we do live in a hierarchical world that creates great separation between the rich and the poor, but how, after so many years of civilization, are people going to be willing to step away from their lives and revert back to tribalism? Quinn offers a couple of solutions, but fails to explain how they will work. Reading this book left me with many questions. Quinn leaves many lose ends and refers to his previously written books assuming that the reader has read them. I found this to be confusing at times while reading this book. On a more positive note, Quinn does convey his passion for the need for change. There is no doubt that Quinn believes Civilization will lead to our failure here on Earth. Beyond Civilization is not a book that I would recommend one reads unless you have read Quinn's previous books and enjoyed reading his writings.",0,0,0,0

R3VG5PSP5FLL5D,"I ordered this for my Lexmark X6150 which is an older printer but the website stated that it is compatible.  So, naturally, I placed an order and received it yesterday.  I went to go print something off of the computer and when I did, it asked me to install a cartridge.I did everything from cleaning the cartridge itself to cleaning the part where it holds the actual cartridge inside the printer.  Nothing happened.  I even tried to switch sides, making sure it was installed properly and what do you know, I still had the same results.Boy was I in for a surprise.  I should have read the 1-star reviews for this product before purchasing it.  The thing WILL NOT WORK, even when I tried making a copy, nothing came out but a blank piece of paper.So, for those if you thinking about getting this cartridge, beware:  It will more than likely NOT work with your printer.  Plus, there's either some Chinese/Japanese wording on the side (like in the picture above) that states ""not for customer use"", whatever that means.Now I'm stuck with a faulty cartridge and cannot return it seeing as how I already opened the packaging materials and tried using it in my printer.  I guess it's time to throw out my 10 year old printer and buy a newer, modern day one.",0,0,0,0
R3R9HDGP7ID1OL,"I understand why other reviewers hate this book. It is a very difficult book to like. It is by far the most politically correct romance story I have ever read (and that is counting Catherine Coulter, who is another queen of politically incorrect).What is not right about this book.......violence against women (however mild it was, he did spank her as a punishment, and that was no flirting), rape (let's not get into technicality here, she was forced into the situation, whether she enjoyed the sexual act is not the point), kidnapping (through and through being held against her will). These are bitter pills to swallow.I do not ""hate"" the book with passion. I can learn to ignore the above, knowing that it is a fiction and can therefore choose to overlook the glaring horrors. What truly troubles me is how immature the writing is. While people may complain about the immorality of such a story, I think the worst of this book is the fact that it was not written very well. Johanna Lindsey has grown as a writer tremendously and her later writing quality is not to be doubted. But the writing in this debut novel, leaves much to be desired.I think the story has a lot of potential. Maybe Lindsey would consider rewriting this book.",0,0,0,0

R18QA48V0Q312U,"I've owned the Charles Leonard pencil sharpener (model #89508)for six months. After reading many reviews and searching the web for an economical and functional rotary pencil sharpener I took the plunge and bought this sharpener. And then wanted to return it.First flaw, the mounting screws are useless. I knew this going into the purchase and thought a trip to the hardware store would make for an easy fix. Now I ask, why should I do the work that is the MANUFACTURER's responsibility?? It's still not mounted. I've many other things I need to do and doing somebody else's job isn't among them.Second flaw, because it is unmounted (still) one person has to hold the sharpener firmly down so another person can sharpen the pencil. Typically somebody knocks off the cover...frequently...because it just does NOT stay on...and it ain't goin' back on in a hurry! The cover just does NOT go back on in the up/down position (as shown in the picture). Mine has dents from forcing it back into position.If it were sideways mounted(HA!)then presto, no problemo, the cover easily goes on sideways. EVERY time a pencil is sharpened the cover comes off and pencil grindings are everywhere...again!!Third flaw, yes the sharpener has eight holes for differing sizes of pencils. One hole is helpfully marked STANDARD to show where standard-sized pencils ought to fit. I'm not sure which country the Standard is set but it isn't the U.S. since my average #2 U.S. school pencils don't fit in the standard slot.For that matter, my child's oversized pencil fits in the largest oversized hole but the burr doesn't touch the pencil. What's the point of offering eight sizes if the largest holes are just for appearance not function?Lastly, sometime recently it began only sharpening effectively in one direction. And not in the comfortable direction but the awkward one (remember it takes two people to run it). When the sharpener was new the burr mostly cut the pencils on all sides so maybe it was worth a little effort. Now it only shaves one side. The tip is long and sharp...and breaks often so that now I'm back where I began: looking on Amazon for a functioning rotary pencil sharpener.In the immortal words of my child: ""The thing's a ripoff"".",0,0,0,0

And that is a pity, because the premise of this story could have made a much stronger book.  Burdett got carried away with fatuous riffs on meditation in general and on Buddhism in particular.  Plus the device of his hero speaking condescendingly to the reader as ""farang"" has become pretty tiresome.  I am skeptical this book would have found a publisher if it was the author's first effort, instead of feeding a huge and loyal fan base's appetite for more ""Bangkok murder mysteries"".  Burdett's Editor failed badly on this one - that red pen is sorely needed. I give 5 stars to Bangkok-8 and Bangkok-Tattoo, and 4 stars to Bangkok-Haunts. This one gets 2-plus . . . maybe 3-minus for the creativity of the plot.  But a disappointing sequel overall.",0,0,0,0

R1DF7M7AHNON5L,"I wanted to like this book a lot, and kept turning the pages waiting for the interesting questions and challenges that so many other people raved about to be discussed. Instead, while the book did briefly touch on some interesting and important questions, it didn't do them any justice by exploring them in any depth. Again, I really wanted to like this book, but it really left me wanting after reading everyone else's reviews.I did think the book was an interesting exploration of the culture and history of Japan, so I don't regret reading the book.More than the content, I think the biggest disappointment is the publishing of the book itself. I'm not sure that Picador put a lot of effort into it, instead just throwing it together in time to get a quick buck out of it from association with the movie. It contains 5 separate sections that are summaries of the book - Foreword, Translaters Preface, Publishers Note, A Note on Silence, and Meet the Author. They all are all very repetitive, and sadly, I think all of them expect the Translators Preface did a poor job of discussing the book.One last item, I can't be certain if this is the publisher's fault, the translators, or simply the loss of something in the translation process, but the book is incredibly confusing to read. There are times when days pass between paragraphs (not chapters, paragraphs in the same chapter) and it's never mentioned, and sometimes I thought weeks were passing and later learned it was only a day or so. Additionally, the perspective of the book changes frequently. At one point in a chapter titled ""Extracts From the Diary of Jonassen"" (a character never discussed anywhere else in the book) the perspective suddenly changes from diary entries back to 3rd person discussing the main character. There is only a paragraph break, nothing else indicating that a switch is happening. I initially thought it was the continuation of a diary entry, and ended up having to read it about 3 times before I finally decided it was just a perspective change. This ambiguity of time and randomness of narration happens frequently, and I found myself re-reading a lot of the book just trying to figure out what was going on, which was a very frustrating experience.",0,0,0,0

R2X5UKHZP0RATU,"Let me first say that MB20 is one of my 5 favorite bands right now, and was very eager to get this DVD set.  The song list is amazing and the band seems to be on their game throughout the concert.BUT, a concert DVD should sound good... RIGHT?  Well, I'm not sure who gets the blame, but the sonic quality of this disk is TERRIBLE.  On Dolby5.1, the rear speaker are way too loud with crowd noise, mostly girls screaming.  I could live with that if the front three channels were pumping quality stage sound, but sadly they are not.  Rob sounds like he is inside a tin can for most the DVD.  Background vocals are barely heard.  Sometimes the guitars sound OK, but usually not.  Only the drumming sounds crisp.  When I tried simple two-channel stereo, it sounded slightly better but still not great.  I am very picky, but even my wife, who is happy to listen to a boom-box half the time, said she thought the DVD sounded awful.I really hate to give these guys a bad rating, but what a let down!!!!",0,0,0,0

Look elsewhere for a sturdier compass that comes with all pieces as advertised.Upon receipt it appears we (possibly) received a used item as there were markings on the interior packaging, and there was no extra lead as indicated on the item description. The compass is very lightweight, and tends to “slip” frequently during use. I intentionally chose this compass as it was packaged separately (rather than a set), and quality appeared to be better than the type with mini-pencils inserted in product images.

R3ULOTTWI07DLG,"The  Parker IM Black Gold Trim Fountain Pen, Medium Nib - 1760800  is  a nice looking Parker pen which arrives in a soft box containing a single cartridge and warranty.  If there's a problem with the pen,  Parker requires a copy of your sales order because Amazon does not stamp the date of purchase on the warranty.  With this pen, use of the warranty is likely.  I'd read reviews abound with complaints regarding the faulty ink flow to the nib and the one I received is awful.  I'd also purchased an ink converter, so I know it's not the cartridge, as I've tried about a half dozen different inks.  With each, even if I leave the pen for an hour, it dries and I must either prime the converter or dip the nib into water or ink.  I was embarrassed at a meeting when the pen would not write and  I needed to sign a document.  Visually, this pen is five star.  In the hand, it's also five star.  If it worked properly, it would be a total five star value.  Unfortunately, a pen that doesn't write is worthless unless you've purchased it for another purpose.  I purchase pens to use as a tool for transporting ink to paper, so this one is a great disappointment.

R159AFXAVV0BSA,"The problem, I suppose, is that when one is writing ""as Ian Fleming"", one is expected to write like Ian Fleming.Devil May Care, the new `adult' James Bond novel (as opposed to the `young' Bond book series by Charlie Higson) is written by Sebastian Faulks.  Now, I've read Ian Fleming, and Mr. Faulks is no Ian Fleming.  There is next to no of the so called ""Fleming sweep"" that picks you up and carries you through the book.  Part of the reason why is every time the story starts to sweep you along, Mr. Faulks cuts away to somewhere else.The first half of the book also suffers from mischaracterizations of familiar characters from the Bond canon.  Bond's housekeeper May is the first causality.  If you had read Fleming, you would know how see addresses Bond.  They way Faulks does it I found to be jarring.  We expect familiar reactions from familiar characters.  Bonds' boss M. suffers the same fate.  Who is this person?  Certainly not the man who sent Bond on all those dangerous missions.  Can you picxture that M., aka Sir Miles Messervy, asking Bond to bring him chocolates on his way back from Paris?  What the Devil is going on here?And then we have the mission.  Summer,1967:  M. has a feeling that someone is up to no good and wants Bond to find out what it is.That's it.  That's all the reason Bond is sent on a mission. A feeling. All that's needed, I suppose.The fact that the person really is up to something doesn't matter.Plus, as it turns out, M. is not being truthful to Bond.  Sends him out without the full and truthful information that Bond may need to survive.  ""Not quite cricket"", as the villain would (and does) say in this book.By the time the nefarious plot of the villain is revealed, we are more than halfway into the book.  And then it turns out to be a revenge plot against England.  But what about the whole setup about drug running?  Oh, all this and World War III?  And the British non-involvement in Viet Nam....?The Devil May Care about this book, but I really don't. It's second rate Bond, ranking alongside the worst of the Gardner books (Don't get me wrong, I only consider one or two of Gardner books really bad).  Muddled villain reasonings, characters who appear then vanish (Bond's once and future secretary, brought back for no reason at all after leaving the service OVER FIVE YEARS BEFORE THE STORY BEGINS). Badly characterization of familiar figures, and familiar figures who are brought into the story just to be brought into the story (Felix Leiter, although I'm always glad to see him, really didn't need to be in this book).To be a second rate Fleming could be forgiven.  To give us a second rate adult Bond after all this time....unforgivable.",0,0,0,0

R20M5H8RGK884O,"Shipped in a box for best protection however box was mishandled, smoosed, and had one corner dented with a small hole. The boards were slightly curved but not bad enough to return and wasn't attributed to mishandling. Some of the boards corners had slight indentations.  Was able to straighten out most of the curve by placing boards underneath a heavy book. They straighten out quicker by gently bending by hand individually or 5 at a time. The measurements were accurate as described on Amazon. If the bags were slightly wider and the boards completetly straight I'd up my rating to 4 because not all of the bags were clear.  Holding each bag up to a light I saw some imperfections. None of the boards were chemically treated evenly on the one side. When looking at chemical side up and tilted so when the light shined on it could see the chemical visible and it wasn't evenly distributed on the board and was uneven with patches-blotches. You would never notice just by casually looking at the bags and boards.The boards did fit the bags with space to put the comic with a little wiggle room and will accomodate  regular comics but not silver.  I will use these bags and boards for regular common comics.The price was only $22 and a couple of days later see the price went up to $37.Even though Amazon backs their products including 3rd parties, has excellent customer service, and has my back for a return and refund due to no fault of my own I plan to to purchase comic book bags and boards at my comic book store so I'll see exactly what I'm getting and have no surprises!!",0,0,0,0

R2OOQOFJ26KUCH,"I have never written a review of a software product before. I felt compelled to write one about FranklinCovey's PlanPlus For Microsoft Outlook 2.0 because I hope to that it will dissuade people from wasting money on this product.Until I bought this product, I had no beef with the company FranklinCovey. I have been using their paper planner for the last 6 years. I had hoped that PlanPlus would simplify my life by allowing me to use planning tools while in Outlook. In reality, I have had nothing but trouble with the nearly impossible installation, the buggy product, and the infuriating tech support.It started when I tried to install the product on my laptop. I worked with their tech support online (they charge if you want to actually speak with someone). I went through quite a few tech support people, many of whom seemed to repeat the same mantra of ""uninstall/reinstall"" which I did countless times. I really had to push them to get them to help me. When they were stumped and they said they would research the issue and get back to me and of course they never did. Eventually  I got someone online and I would not let them go until we resolved the installation problem. After 5 days of working at this, it was finally installed. To my horror, it slowed down outlook so significantly that I decided to uninstall it.Around the same time I was dealing with problems with the install on my laptop, I was trying to also install this on my desktop PC. I worked with tech support for about 3 weeks off and on. Again, they were stumped. They kept repeating the phrase, ""We will get back to you at the earliest."" I never heard back from them. Now I wonder what they meant. Was it the earliest ice age? The earliest millenium? They kind of left it open for interpretation. It's been several months now and I have wasted so much time on this. I was never able to install the product, I kept getting an error message and the installation would stop.I can't return the product because they don't accept returns on software if it has been opened. All I can do at this point is vow never to buy another FranklinCovey product again and encourage others to reconsider their plans to purchase this product. If you are a diehard Franklin Planner user, like I was, I would recommend that you stick with the paper planner - it's far less buggy and you won't have to deal with an indifferent tech support that will ""get back to you at the earliest.""",0,0,0,0

RPTG4M3FH50FS,"If this movie had been a buddy bonding movie I would have given it three stars.  This movie tries to be a buddy-nerd bonding movie and it fails in that sub-genre.  To be a movie about nerds or geeks the characters have to have dialogue that is ecclectic and esoteric.  The characters have to say things that other geeks and nerds would understand and find interesting but that most people wouldn't.  In this movie there are no references to STOS, STNG, STV, Star Wars, Soylent Green, Planet of the apes, Thunderbirds, Dark Shadows, Night Stalker, et al.  There is one running gag about a fictional writer.  There is also a long diatribe agianst Christianity(although oddly nothing about Islam.)  For a movie about UFO's I wonder why they didn't have Art Bell do a cameo.  The protaganists in this movie might be geeks but we don't know because they never talk about anything that would be vaguely interesting to another geek.  They never mentioned D&D.",0,0,0,0

R12S4B4UIE4I3H,"Probably a 2.5 since I was compelled to stay up late and finish.I liked this story; I didn't love it. It's certainly emotional and with lots of life details. While I empathized with the choices Xander and Chris felt forced to make, there were times I felt it was too much drama. The 3rd home game thing was too much for me. The author just didn't sell me on the reasons for it. And I think that was the hardest part for me, the author style. The story jumps around with a lot of ""looking back"" times. I can't really imagine the stress this kind of secrecy would put on a relationship, but it feels like I should have. She writes these angsty intense situations, and I'm not feeling it enough. I found myself skimming a lot. The story was looong, and I wasn't all emotionally tied into it. I WANTED to understand and just couldn't get there with these guys.The difficult part is comparison.

Strangely, if I set the printer from normal quality to best quality printing, the problem intensified.  Since these tanks are much cheaper than HP original, if you were printing a large number of review pages it would be worth it, otherwise not worth the money as I am not sending out anything printed from this ink.

R198IMX2T9SBAX,"+4 stars for being a very versatile printer (5), -1 star for going too far trying to enforce use of Epson ink. (4) -3 stars for designing a printer that's too complicated/cheap to last past 1 year or 1-2 ink changes. (1) +1 star for customer service sort of trying to help, and at least paying for shipping of broken printers or bad Epson ink that it can't detect. Bringing us to a fairly poor 2 Star Review.Scans, copies, can print on a large variety of paper types in many different qualities. Easy wi-fi access. The printer is cheap. I would be very happy with this printer if it wasn't for its tendency to clog/stop working and the ridiculous ink practices.Worked great as a home printer for ~8 months, changed the ink cartridges and immediately clog problems began. Auto-cleaning programs worked for another 3 months while HEAVILY wasting ink the entire time. 3rd ink change (much sooner than should be necessary) and one color no longer prints entirely with no help from the auto-cleaning program. The printer is too ""complicated"" to be cleaned at home or have a nozzle replaced so in the end I ship it out for a replacement printer.New printer arrives, and the Epson branded ink that comes with it don't work with the printer. They've designed so many guards against re-fills and off brands that there isn't even work-arounds to their own ink failing the test. If a different ink cartridge doesn't work, then I'll get the joy of shipping out my 2nd printer for a replacement.TLDR: It is cheap, appears great, does lots of amazing things, but it is a lie. It will break, or clog, or cost far more in ink than you ever would have accepted if you'd known. At least that's how I feel at the end of this, and I just keep going because they just keep sending me replacements.",0,0,0,0

R2OKXST9UHMVR4,"you'd think a new book after the Brodie book would have alot of new stuff,but if you thought that you'd be thinking wrong.For instance the defection of the witnesses the Whitmers. In the Brodie book,the Whitmer's reason for leaving is presented as because they developed their own properties and wished to live their lives free from interference by Mormon heirarchy. The Whitmers stated that they wished rather to ""abide by the laws of the land"",meaning the present United States government as represented by the Constitution.Their choice.They were houndogged and branded apostates by the Mormon church. In the Bushman book,the author somewhat defends Smith's harsh actions implying that the Whitmers were greedy,taking land purchased by Mormons for Mormons and then keeping it privately.It seems in the Bodie book the Whitmers didn't want to pay the morman hierarchy the equivalent of a ""quitrent""but rather sought the American dream of a place of their own,especially seeing as Smith and his hierarchy had declared bankruptcy a few times themselves.I know the book isn't about the Whitmers but even the short paragraphs devoted to this subject are vastly different.It reminds one of the school shop project that was only 1/32 of an inch off when it began. Then by the time the project was finished it was unrecognizable cause that 1/32 was 12 board feet at the end.Bushman however does point out that it would have been possible to subject the Book of Mormon to scholarly exam because the Rosetta stone was found about 10 years before Smith's book. Since Smith claimed it was written in ancient Egyptian,it  would have been to Smith's benefit to subject the book to an exam by the Egyptologists familiar with the Rosetta stone. Smith and his cohorts never bothered to contact any the scholars and the book of Mormon mysteriously(or conveniently) disappeared. Also there was little emphasis placed on the editing of the Book of Mormon by Smith's associates,whereas the Brodie book mentions numerous occasions of Smiths' more scholarly affiliates cleaning up his""countryisms"". It makes you wonder how many other cleanings occurred not mentioned.The Brodie book left me with the remembrance of the old adage,""Power corrupts,absolute power corrupts absolutely"",a proverb that applied to Smith.You can't help but assess an economic motive for an undetermined percentage of people following the pronouncements of the prophet from reading the Brodie book.If you're a landless working mechanic or artisan working for starvation wages in any slum in the new or old world and someone offers you land and credit and a chance to better your station,are you going to count their wives or debate theology?Bushman doesn't even mention the vulnerability of these new immigrants to manipulation by the well established LDS hierarchy of the time,that's a terrible ommision for someone purporting to give a new perspective on Smith and his associates. I read Bushman before the Brodie book,that was a mistake,had i read Brodie first I probably wouldn't even had read Rough Stone at all,the book is so convincing I can see why the Mormon church wishes it gone.Then I saw some of the current news about the primitivist Mormon polygamist sects,and it hit me about the Brodie book.It looks like the same show 170 years later only with the benefit of public scrutiny through the media. Even if the leaders in 1840,wanted your wife,could you say no,being as vulnerable as a person was in the frontier areas in the 1840's. Remember the Mormon church offered the immigrant protection,security and work.Like Tennesse Ford says,""I owe my soul to the company store"".In both books the authors acknowledge that Mormon missionaries generally went to areas of skilled labor(but poor) to gain their converts.Poor and unskilled?Now there's a real challenge that only a saint or masochist will tackle.As I finished Bookman's book I said,""yes Smith is controversial""(but who isn't,a mixture of good and bad). Bushman gives the example of Smith ruining his business by giving away everything without demanding payment. Was this after or before stealing someone else's wife?The Brodie book leaves you little in doubt that Smith was indeed a polygamist,whereas the Bushman says yeah but sort of nay.Not that serial monogamy is any better,but at least it is legal,and doesn't quite stir up the anger as polygamy does. Also since a person had to hand all their resources over when joining the church there would be plenty of new resources.With the Brodie book I said,even if I have only deceived myself,""I think I own this Smith guy"".Rough Stone Rolling is an attempt to clean up some of the myths surrounding Smith,but given some of the prophets' past behaviors i don't think Brodie's conclusions are that far off the mark.If it looks and quacks like a duck it's probably a duck,but it could be a teal!2 stars for trying to downgrade Brodie and missing the mark!!",0,0,0,0

There should be a CLASS ACTION SUIT against them for all customers who have lost money and time using these workforce machines (3620, 3640, 7610, 7620, 7110).The entire printer design is FLAWED!  The ""high-tech"" PrecisionCore printhead with pico sized droplets sounds great UNTIL IT CLOGS which is often!  Then if you do enough printer cleans and it still doesn't work, the ink will backup and flow right into the printhead electronics and burn out the printhead cable or short the printhead out!!!  This is a seriously flawed design and Epson knows it.This is not to mention the fact that these printhead cleanings use up a ton of ink and Epson wants to force you to use only their ink which should be illegal anyways.  It is anti-competitive and this business practice should also be challenged in court!  They are purposely blocking 3rd party ink carts in their firmware.If you run out of ANY color, you can't print black even if you have tons of black or anything for that matter!

It arrived on time in nicer than usual packaging and contained a nice note about  the business and family. Had there been an email address, this would have gone there first, instead of public. The box states the item was made in China but designed in Canada. Somewhere between the two there was the slightest of breakdowns. While I was unpacking the item, I had a momentary distraction and -thump- something hit my shoe. It was the roll of tape that comes with the unit. There's where the devil is in the details. The plastic spool tasked with holding the roll of tape doesn't. It so nearly almost does, then the roll of tape slips off.  I did not try the included roll of tape. The tape I use is heavier than most and I wrapped 5 turns of that around the slippery slightly smallish spool and loaded the reel. Taping the taper helped some and a proper application of duct tape will make the taper good as, make that better than new.

As for the top surface, it's really smooth so your mouse glides around with ease. I'm using a relatively standard sized wireless mouse and there's enough real estate on the surface for me to move the mouse from one edge of the screen to the next. What ultimately causes this mouse to fail is its most unique feature: the gel pad. The gel within the padding area is actually quite hard. So, after a while, the wrist area that is in contact with the gel pad actually starts hurting. Your wrist is probably better off not having anything underneath it at all. In spite of its many positive features, it still receives a 2-star rating due to the fatal flaw of the gel pad.",0,0,0,0

Try to open a trouble ticket before ordering the service, you’ll see what I mean.

R2PMBJRZCEQ5U7,"...OK - the disclosure: I do not own and have not purchased, tried, sampled or otherwise set my hands on the 'latest' NeatReceipts scanner/software. I did buy the 'full' scanner about 3-4 years ago. As I recall, I had a terrible time getting it installed. And, once installed, it simply did not do what it said it would do. Not even close. I could have worked faster with a Big Chief tablet and a No. 2 pencil. So...why this review...to thank everyone who recently tried the 'system' and gave it a lowly review (lots of 1 stars...possibly because you can't give 0 stars). I had my credit card out, ready to order, when I thought I should check the reviews. Glad I did. Sadly, this is a very poor product -- well-conceived, poorly executed. Sad....because many, many people really want and/or need something like this that works. The plus -- at least for the company -- is that people keep buying it. To those people, please call me.

Of the positive reviews, I doubt that the posters recognize what happened ""behind the scenes"" with their hard drive and operating system (see last paragraph).  To be fair, the unit I received may have been defective, but keep reading....I received the product and downloaded the most recent software and drivers.  Went through the install process as described.  Tried scanning my first card.  The scan quality was so horrible that I think I may have received a defective unit.  Each scan looked like a blur of colors and lines.  After 10-15 tries, the software was able to pick up the NAMES (just the names!) on the business cards about 1 out of every 4 times.I decided to uninstall the software, and this is where things got messy.  The install program apparently installed multiple programs to Windows XP.  The main program is a resource hog. Uninstalling doesn't remove everything installed.  This is extremely sloppy programming and shows a lack of ""respect"" for customer's home computers. Even if I HAD received a defective unit, the software and install/uninstall experience deserve the 1 star.  If you are like me, and like to keep your computer clean and running well, the software with this product makes a mess of your hard drive and operating system.  I had to sift through my registry manually and run specialized software just to ensure that everything was removed- and I'm STILL not 100% that I've completely erased the traces of this software.

R2ZM98NG4F9H9E,"What is this obsession with writing spin off books of popular sci fi series? Look at how pitiful and useless the Doctor Who ""Missing  Adventures"" are (read my review on Interference by Lawrence Miles).  There is something to be said about appreciating something upon its own  merits and not attempting to recapture it out of greed for more money from  the fans. Show some integrity. The ""original"" Herbert wrote with  a style that didn't trivialize. He gave the readers the facts as they  needed to know. This work knows nothing of minimalism as every specific  action is drolled out. How over descriptive do you need to get before you  realize Dune fans are NOT second graders? With this pop-Star Trek fiction  approach the Dune characters are degenerated into sub-average 90s  charicatures. And having Baron Harkonnen show up himself is as dumb as  Jabba The Hutt crawling into a gratuitous scene where his bounty hunters  should have sufficed. This is as lame as that Young Indiana Jones crud (see  my review on Trenches of Hell). Show some class.

R3SVML2SF0KG76,"When this came out it was all the rage.  Didn't it win or get nominated for an Oscar?  So I guess a film like this is still considered exotic and cutting edge.  I sure don't know why.  Maybe some people have yet to understand that multiculturalism in a ghetto doesn't work.  The stream of consciousness script suffers from a deep dependency on trying to be cute and tricky by throwing in an anomaly here and there, but it fails miserably as these are just silly contrivances.  The black youth who is into country music, hitch hiking a ride back to the city from the valley after ice-skating and confessing his dream of being a goalie is shot and killed by the white driver who thinks the youth has a gun, it turns out to be a skate key.  Another laughable moment is the hot car parts guy offering to buy the Cambodian immigrants from the [black] car thief who subsequently ""frees"" them instead of taking the money.  C'mon give me a break!  In the modern PC world people are much more subtle then this.  The dialogue and story line is just silly at times.Stereotypes are generalities about a race or culture.  There is a reason why stereotypes exist.  It's because they are generally true.  But is the issue really race and culture or is it one of class?  Either way I say so what?  This film wants you to feel guilty about the occasional racial slip of the tongue or for leaving the city and moving out to the suburbs where you lose touch.  Believe me I lived in the pit of hell called LA for far too long.  Crime is rampant, the schools are disgusting and worthless, and the bureaucrats are just getting fatter and fatter.  I used to wake up angry all the time too.  So I left and I make no apologies for it.  Do I reside in a super white bread upper middle class community?  You bet, and guess what, no crime, great public schools, low taxes, and no more anger.  Is that just a coincidence; I think not.  Bad people live in the world.  They come in all colors and from all cultures, but they are generally poor, uneducated, and live in overpopulated urban areas.  Throwing out a racial epithet under the heat of the moment doesn't make you a racist...it makes you human and fallible and one seeking immediate, cheap emotional gratification.  Don't feel guilty about it.  This flick is a waste of time.  In the end heavy handed clichés and a preachy ""can't wall all just get along"" mess packaged in two long hours is all you get.

R3JD5ZTYT44KL3,"This book is a fine example of pseudo-science presented in a way that easily deceives its targeted non-educated audience.Here are just a couple of basic issues. Yes, if the Earth were at 60% of its present size, the gravity would indeed be lower. BUT: this assumes equal density, meaning that in order to maintain it with increased size, the planet would have to gain mass as well. If the Earth were smaller AND lighter, where did additional mass come from? If addition of 20 to 40% of Earth mass occurred within the last 60 million years since the dinosaurs, I'm sure someone would notice. This would have a been a catastrophic world-changing event that would have wiped out all life. However, there is only the calmly continuous geological record with nicely drifting continents and no trace of changing size of the planet.Now, Mr. Hurrell conveniently skips the fact that there were no exceptionally large animals BEFORE dinosaurs either. Does it mean that the Earth was heavy initially (small animals), then suddenly became small and light (just to accommodate the dinosaurs) and then grew in mass again right after they had gone extinct? Remember that all changes involve enormous masses of a quarter to a third of the total Earth mass. Does that sound plausible to anyone with a brain?Next, why did Mr. Hurrell need to invent this outlandish ""explanation"" of the dinosaur size if there is a perfectly adequate one accepted by paleontologists? Besides, the fossilized bones of dinosaurs were fully capable of carrying their weight at the current gravity. In the event of lower gravity, why bother with the extra bulk of the bones if the lighter ones would do just fine?Insects were large in the carboniferous era not because of low gravity, but because of high oxygen content in the atmosphere (over 35% vs. 21% now). This allowed them to get around the size restriction imposed by a passive oxygen transport system. If Mr. Hurrell were a paleontologist, he would have known that. But being an engineer, he compensated his ignorance with vivid imagination.Finally, why didn't Mr. Hurrell publish a paper in a peer-reviewed scientific journal? I mean, the way ACTUAL scientists do when they come up with a revolutionary new theory? The answer: because all of his ""arguments"" would have fallen apart in the first round of the review process.Mr. Hurrell is not a paleontologist or geologist. And it shows. Please leave science to professionals. And if you so desperately want to make money on cheap publicity, at least pick something less embarrassing.Frankly, it's sad when people make a serious face and call this garbage thought-provoking in their reviews. They clearly take this at face value and fail to do a simple fact check.In summary: if you feel that scientists are lying to you and the Earth is actually flat, go ahead, get this book. It will fit right in with the rest of your library.",0,0,0,0

R1YBR306ET9WSJ,"I bought two tubes on July 12, 2020.  The first one failed within two weeks, developing a pin-hole leak on an interior seam facing the hub.  The second failed within two days of installation, also on an interior seam, different spot.  Since the seam area is ribbed, the tubes can't be patched.  My rim (spoke protector) strip remained in the proper position and is in perfect condition.  The riding conditions and circumstances were not a cause of failure.  Tire inflation was at the lower end of the recommended range.I tried contacting the vendor following the warranty instructions included in the box.  There has been no reply.  I tried calling the manufacturers' U.S. rep and received no assistance.Since other reviewers are also complaining of leaks around the seams, I have to believe the manufacturing process is delivering highly variable results.  The fact that the manufacturer is not standing behind the product is disappointing.One other thought.  The slime tubes can ""clog"" around the Schrader valve, making it difficult to top off once the tire is initially inflated.  You need to remove the valve stem, clean off the gunk, and try again.  But note, a pinhole on a rim-facing side isn't exposed to the slime, so those holes will leak.  In other words, with slime tubes it's possible to have all the disadvantages of slime and none of the advertised benefits.UPDATE: August 28, 2020The vendor replied by e-mail while this review was being processed by Amazon, offering an exchange or refund.  I chose the refund which they indicated would take 3-6 weeks to process.  Rating changed from 1 star to 2 stars.",0,0,0,0

RQYWX4ENQTMX2,"Those of you who are curious about Turistas won't miss anything earth shattering if you pass it by. As other reviewers have correctly pointed out, this movie is another lame attempt at extreme horror in the recent  subgenre of torture films, a la SAW, HOSTEL, etc. However, Turistas is really bad, and is simply a movie where the violence and gore exist for the sake of the movie. Without these elements, you have no movie. Unlike decent horror films that actually stand on their own without gratuitous blood and guts (but include them for extra effect), Turistas is boring and filled with more holes than swiss cheese.Every scene of blood and gore is unnecessary; when a girl falls off a cliff, do we need to see her splat on the ground to know she died in the fall? When a guy gets his head split open, do we need to constantly see his gaping head wound? And when some dude staples it shut with a staple gun, do we need to see this done in loving detail? To demonstrate how evil the Brazilian surgeon is, did he really have to plunge a skewer through the eye of his henchman and stir it around until he died? (All done at an outdoor cafe, and no one bats an eye)Perhaps most gratuitous and outrageous is the surgery scene where the evil doctor cuts open and extracts the internal organs from a female victim while she is still alive, then plops them on her chest. While the special effects are very good and realistic, did we REALLY have to see all of this in exacting detail to get the idea that this poor girl is having her organs removed without her consent, and is then thrown away like a sack of garbage?My favorite useless and idiotic scenes are when the stranded tourists agree to follow an english speaking Brazilian through miles of jungle only to reach a picturesque waterfall and pool...and go swimming. These are the same people who have had their tour bus go over a cliff, have recently been drugged and robbed of all their possessions, and are desperate, supposedly, to find the police and a way to get back to civilization. Yep, if I were them, in their situation, I would stray from the main roads, hike deep into unchartered jungle with a guy I don't even know, and go swimming. Brilliant.Second in my favorite idiotic plot sequences is the chase at the end through the underwater caves. Now put yourself into the shoes of the bad guys: you're kidnapping Western tourists and illegally removing their organs, killing them at the same time. Four of them escape from your clutches and run into the jungle. Okay, I might chase them a while, but once they start swimming around in underwater caves, what are the chances you're going to be able to recapture them? If they escape, do you really think they'll be able to find your secret liar again if they alert the authorities? Why not let them go and find new victims? Isn't following them into the underwater caves a bit foolhardy? Is it worth the effort?As a brilliant villian, I know how you would answer these questions. Seeing how almost everyone in this movie is pretty stupid, you can guess what happens when the bad guys enter the caves.As you can probably guess, Turistas is only a gore for the sake of gore movie. If all you want to do is watch a few scenes of excessive violence and grue, then please rent or buy Turistas. You can either fast forward the rest of the turgid movie or suffer through it, like I did. You've been warned.",0,0,0,0

The cartridges that came with it were half empty, ran out after printing about 30 color pages. That is how they come even when you buy them new. You have to buy 564xl to get a semi full cartridge. Do you believe that a company actually sells half empty ink cartridges, thats really bad business to me. NOw with that being said, I am currently researching what ink to actually buy as i have read that the ink cartridges hp says to use with it will not work.

R1TTNX2FEDLB3K,"I bought a box of GA Pacific regular copy paper.  I have had to fight curling continuously.  It made printing large docs very time consuming and the paper wouldn't sit flat or stack cleanly at all.  So I did a test.  I printed a 400 page document with the GP paper. I use a brother mfc 8460.  Every six or seven sheets I either had to pull the sheet or push it down.  I had to continuously monitor the production to avoid a jam.  Then I put in Hammermill Copy paper to print a second copy of the same document.  The Hammermill worked perfectly.  So perfectly, that I could write this review while it was priting.  No problem.  The Hammermill paper came out flat and stacked neatly.  This GP paper is garbage compared to Hammermill and I will never, ever purchase GP copy paper again.  I watch for sales and usually get a box of Hammermill for around $30 on sale.  Even if it wasn't, and the GP paper was a little cheaper I would not buy it.  Frankly, I was amazed at the difference.

Excuse me? Have you ever heard of Maximus Decimus Meridius? Commander of the Armies of the North? General of the Felix Legions? And loyal servant to the TRUE emperor(not Commodus, played by Joaquin Phoenix), Marcus Aurelius? THAT man, is the true star of this film.I don't want to come across as mad, and I'm not calling for this individual to be fired, as I'm sure he or she is a very kind person with a family to feed; I only ask that whoever wrote this description kindly watch this film(because clearly they haven't), and then change the ""starring"" role to Russell Crowe.Thank you.Zachary Tank",0,0,0,0

R8NCC413PAWLA,"There is a great deal of difference between ""Remanufactured"" and simply filling an empty cartridge with ink. I do not believe that this company knows the difference. I  bought two cartridges. I tried both of them 3.5 months later. BOTH of them had dry and crusted ink between the printhead and stuck onto the rubber sponge in the holder. It was stuck SO hard that in spite of very slow removal, the printhead ripped the rubber sponge and tore part off. I wrote an honest and sensible letter to the manufacturer and told them of my difficulties. I was met with a FIRM ""Those cartridges are only warranted for 90 days. You are over that. I'm sorry, but there is NOTHING I can do for you."" Allrighty then! So much for THIS company and the member of their ""customer satisfaction TEAM.""My experience with MANY different printers and cartridges are that on a new sealed cartridge that is as old as 4 YEARS out of date that the cartridge performs PERFECTLY. One would think that a genuine REMANUFACTURED item would work out of the sealed container at LEAST 6 months later. Not so on these worthless items. It is difficult to believe that the company would not at least offer me a replacement set after I returned these. They refused to talk about these cartridges any further than they already had. Take a peek at the one star ratings. There are almost as many 1 ratings as 5 ratings. Perhaps they have two shifts?

I’m actually not even sure this book was edited just to be honest.I also find a lot of fault with the MC Taryn. She has a horrible attitude, she’s a bitch, and even though she is trying to be clever, it just comes across as annoying and full of herself. Any time I’ve met a person like this in real life, they are not well like, actually they aren’t liked much at all but for some reason, almost everyone LOVES Taryn and her pitiful attitude. Also, apparently she’s so damn attractive that at least 10 other guys in this book has the hots got her.Another big problem I had was with the perspective of the story. It’s told in 3rd person from both Taryn’s and Trey’s POV...at the same time. I’ve never read a book where I’ll be reading one person’s thoughts and then in the next sentence be reading the other person’s.

R2YQRTY4JEMNSW,"Another reviewer reports correctly that ""the people in Genesis are all exposed as being very human, with fractured families."" So far, so good. That is true, and it is precisely the point of all the stories in the Torah: people are human, and G-d has given them free will. They often make mistakes, from which mankind is supposed to learn.But the discussions of Genesis in Moyers' book, are otherwise hopelessly inconsistent with Jewish thinking. And since Genesis is, after all, the first book in the Jewish Torah, or Five Books of Moses, it's somewhat incomprehensible that Bill Moyers would consult just one Jewish authority, Rabbi Burton Visotzky. Then again, I once heard Moyers dismiss Judaism as the product of an ""angry G-d,"" which was repaired by the coming of Christ. So it's not surprising that Moyers presents by and large extremely negative views of the Genesis stories, making all those people sound devilish.Consider for example Moyers' take on the story of Abraham and Isaac.According to him, G-d is angry and unforgiving. Moyers furthermore condemns Abraham as a mere trickster hiding ""behind his wife's skirts"" and resorting to cunning.There are, however, many other rabbinical interpretations of Abraham and Isaac story in Genesis, Chapter 22. One of the best, to my mind, is offered by W. Gunther Plaut in his 1981 English-opening edition of  The Torah: A Modern Commentary  and  The Torah: Genesis .Plaut correctly notes that the first command to Abraham ""issued by Elohim---the generic term for G-d or gods---and the command is one that other elohim could and did make"" during Abraham's era.However, when Abraham is about to perform the sacrifice, ""it is Abraham's G-d, Adonai, who stays his hand."" In other words, the G-d of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob ""not only rejects the sacrifice of a son by a father, but rejects, as well, its use as a theological theme. This is in stark contrast to Eastern religions...in which a father's sacrificial gift of his son plays an important role.""Thus, Plaut concludes that the G-d of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob rejected the contemporary norms of Biblical times, together with any and all acts of child sacrifice.Plaut's interpretation makes eminent sense, whereas Moyers attempts to discredit the lessons embedded in Genesis, particularly that of Abraham and Isaac.Whereas Moyers constructs a vindictive, dead conversation on Genesis, Plaut genuinely reflects living Judaism.While individual rabbinical scholars may disagree over varied interpretations of Biblical passages, for millennia Jewish sages such as  Rashi  and  Maimonides  have agreed that Torah is open to interpretation. Indeed, they encourage interpretation, teaching that the faithful should deeply question holy texts. The goal, over time: for each person to reach fuller and deeper understanding of HaShem (literally, ""The Name"" [of G-d]). In large measure, thus has the living, loving Jewish faith --- always in pursuit of truth, peace and justice --- evolved.It's a terrible shame that Rabbi Visotzky allowed Moyers to get away with this nonsense.The book has nice art work, though.---Alyssa A.

R2Q8Z113OEHUV4,"Normally I give a book until page 100 before I set it aside as a DNF. However, by that time the hero and heroine had still not met, so I pushed through until they had. At that point, the story did pick up, so I was willing to continue with it. Yet I never truly felt invested in anything that happened.Theophil's choices seemed less like those of a mature adult who has endured abuse and more like a scared teenager with no concept of how his choices would affect others. Grace was somewhat more mature, but still behaved like she might have been seventeen. There was a lot of blushing and stuttering on both sides, and while it was mentioned that they spent hours talking to each other, the reader is not privy to hardly any of the time which these two characters spend one on one.Most of the actual romance between Theo and Grace was seen through the perspective of Bess. Her's was an interesting POV, with a good twist toward the middle of the book, but she over shadowed the two main characters. As well, I also found Earl's perspective to be far more interesting up until the end.Overall, the conflict was not very intense. The characters seemed to forgive and forget without much issue and there was not as much of a climax as I would have liked. It is an easy, uncomplicated read that may offer a few hours of distraction, and there is a good bit of scripture worked into the mix without being overly preach. And that on its own earns the story a couple stars.I have provided an honest review after having received an ARC from the publisher.",0,0,0,0

R3II0Q6NA5KPMM,"This is undoubtedly one of the worst movies of all time. I am totally shocked that Ridley Scott directed it, since he is one of my favorite directors (e.g., Alien, Bladerunner). ...Some of the moronic things about this horrible movie that drove me up a tree follow.The opening scene shows the Romans using something akin to napalm against their enemies. I thought napalm was invented by Dow Chemical in WWII! The main character rides from Germany to the Mediterranean coast of Spain on a horse - in one day. Did you know that tigers live in Africa? The Roman gladius (the sword they used) could not be used for hacking only for stabbing due to its fragility because of the metallurgy of that day. A Roman emperor entering the Colliseum to fight a gladiator??? Sure. Reed gives a truly horrible and cadaverous (fittingly I guess since he died during production) performance. There are continuous nauseous flashback sequences of Crowe's son that made me ill. There's absolutely no evidence that Marcus Aureleus decided to make anyone other than Comodus emperor!Did I mention that the plot is totally boring and predictable, being a typical Hollywood formula with no surprises?The only good thing in this movie was the historically accurate reproduction of the Colliseum. I admit to being impressed with that.For the rest of the movie: feh! I'd give it no stars were that possible.This loathsome movie could only appeal to morons who have no grasp of history, plot, acting, geography (I still can't get over those tigers in Africa), or metallurgy, and who have taken a dramamine to combat the nauseous flashback scenes.",0,0,0,0

I initially set it up in my home office excited to see what it could do.  5 seconds after turning it on it short circuited my office.  Thinking I might have overloaded the room with too many devices I unplugged basically everything but my pc and the printer ... turned on the printer same result.  Rinse, repeated several more times--same result.As was noted in other reviews, it is simply ridiculous that 1 such device draws so much power.  Just fyi, I'm set up with a pc, Samsung printer, scanner, cannon color printer, laptop, paper shredder, router/modem, 2 external hard drives and monitor in my office.

R3PGG1ZITCTB5C,"If your idea of a fun movie is sitting in on someone's marriage counseling, by all means watch this movie. However, that's not my idea of a good time and frankly it wasn't even interesting. I borrowed this movie from the library and the blurbs on the case used words like ""funny"" and ""comedy,"" but they lied.I thought with Steve Carell being some big therapist the couple had to fly out of state to see, there was going to be some humor there but his part was totally straight and very conventional. I have no idea why anybody would spend big bucks for such therapy, a brand new college grad could have provided the same quality of therapy. Even with us (the audience) sitting in on the therapy sessions, we never really learn why the main characters have ended up the way they did. And a LOT of the movie consists of therapy sessions.Yes there were a few chuckles here and there and a heartwarming ending, but I really only kept watching because with such good actors I felt sure it must get better (wrong).If you don't agree with my review, please just enjoy this movie, write your own glowing review, and don't slam me. I'm entitled to my opinion and maybe someone else will benefit from my review. Sorry to be on the defensive but movie reviews seem to be a world unto themselves. I'm just trying to be helpful.

R124U0R6V2L12C,"Shawn Mims' single ""This Is Why I'm Hot"" indicates another one of those cases where a song hit #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 before I'd ever heard of it, and when I finally did hear it, I wished I STILL hadn't heard of it. But that's actually one of the better songs on his debut, Music Is My Savior.Chandler and Norfeest's respective reviews are pretty accurate, but I have to say that I actually don't think that MIMS is trying to copy Jay-Z's style. MIMS' style seems to be nothing but wack similes scattered throughout been-there-done-that topics. This is evident by lame tracks like ""Big Black Train"", ""Like This"" (with its repetitive chorus and bridge) and especially ""Girlfriend's Favorite MC"". And as far as when Bun-B and Bad Seed show up for the obligatory screwed song ""They Don't Wanna Play"", the only saving grace is, unsurprisingly, Bun's verse; Seed is having trouble keeping up with the beat, and the chorus sounds like the beat was jacked from Lil' Wayne's ""Cash Money Millionaires"".The hidden track ""I Did You Wrong"" (an ode to sleeping around) starts out fine but then gets ridiculous once you reach the second verse. And as I stated before, ""This Is Why I'm Hot"" isn't that great, especially with the chorus: ""I'm hot `cause I'm fly/You ain't `cause you not"". Ooooh; THAT'S telling `em. And the reggae remix of it doesn't go anywhere either. Then there's ""Cop It"", which has its own situation: the beat is one that you'll either think is great or annoying, but in either case, it isn't helped by MIMS saying things like ""I'm hotter than cooked food"". ""Just Like That"" has too many sorry comparisons to mention, and ""Superman"" is just plain wack.There is also a little lack of creativeness with the song titles (""Like This"" followed by ""Just Like That""). And you know an album is bad when the best moments are the intro and outro (the latter features crooning by someone called Purple Popcorn). If MIMS truly thinks music is his savior, then maybe it's time to change denominations.Anthony Rupert",0,0,0,0

RUAB3IUP6Z7M0,"There are things I like about this Ball Pen; the look, the brown colour is a little bit unconventional, its overall weight is ok and the ink itself flows smoothly but the 'grip' on this Ball Pen is the worst of any I have ever used.The end of the pen (the part I hold when writing) is polished metal and looks nice BUT is so super-polished it's like silk and my fingers slip down towards the nib when I try using it (and typically I grip tightly enough to cause a pressure bump to appear at the grip point on my middle finger fairly shortly after I start writing).If instead of being polished metal, the end of the pen had been made of the same brown lacquer utilised in the shaft of the pen then I would have had no problems as that material is comfortable to hold and gives a good grip, unfortunately, it's set too far back for my fingertips to hold in order to write normally or comfortably.In addition to this, and it's not so easy to tell from the photo, but the polished end is not simply tapered but subtly concave (it has an outwards curve from the shaft to the tip) which amplifies the awkwardness of gripping the silky smooth end of this pen when writing.Out of curiosity, I've just looked back at the many positive reviews and noticed they are mainly for either the Parker Fountain Pens or the Parker Rollerballs, (which Amazon have combined with this) and both of which have differently shaped gripping ends to this Parker Ball Pen.",0,0,0,0
R3JHIQF63FSXBN,"Disclaimer: This review is written from a Catholic perspective and a gnostic Church-hating reader might have a much different experiende.The book pretends to be a scientific work, but is in fact a pro-cathar and anti-Catholic apology. The author omits the darker sides of catharism dismissing them off-hand as catholic calomnies and the logical conclusions that must drawn from the theological position of the Believers in Catharism, while nitpicking in detail every imperfection and abuse of power of the Albigensian crusade and the subsequent inquisition (of which there were many, surely, and that were indeed very harsh).The author has the tendency of jumping to conclusions where it suits him and proposing these as facts (e.g. the Perfects in Montségyr were exclusively old mystics who whiled their days away in prayers or young initiates, etc). The author also has no trouble in defending Cathar actions as ""necessary"" even when his judgment would have been much harsher towards Catholics.Furthermore, the author makes theological judgment along the lines of ""what the Cathars believed is more correct than what the Catholics believe"" without any actual qualification or logical rationale behind the statements based solely on the tenet of ""I like this better"" and goes to great length to explain away the gaping holes in Cathar pesudo-theology. Indeed, it seems evident to me that the author is himself a gnostic and would have loved to be a Cathar if only he could and - to be fair - hints at such a position in his Introduction. (However, he should have stated that openly to be completely honest as I do at the beginning of my review).I bought the book for my kindle at $2.19 which I find adequate price for the deeply flawed book. Also, it does contain some information on Cathar believes and practices...that, however, is clouded by the author's tendency to masturbate intellectually and emotionally over his own love for the concepts and Catharism.In conclusion, I am not happy with the book. I would have liked to read more facts and less posturing and hate.",0,0,0,0

R399RH9NDAATGR,"The idea was good, the execution impossibly bad.Don't waste your time. Seriously. Just don't. If you need more evidence, go check the reviews at the Home Depot website.Let me explain the problem: The ""smaller"" problem is that the pin is built to work by hitting the molding. Since I bought the product specifically to avoid hitting the molding, we already have not met the goal. But the bigger problem is the fact that the pin doesn't stop the door. Unless I want a 45 degree opening in my hallway. This is ideal for a cat, ferret, Dachshund, or Bichon. It barely big enough for my Labrador.As for me, I'd prefer that my hallway door open to a 90 degree angle. Just sayin'.

R1PRS9R2BBG42D,"Last year, Pixar hit gold with Toy Story 3, which may be their crowning moment of glory. One particularly raved about scene (and understandably why) showed the toys being thrust face first into an inferno, trying their hardest to escape, but ultimately holding hands and coming to the realization that they are going to die. That scene became the most talked about scene in 2010's lists of summer blockbusters, on par with the brilliant fight scene in Inception where Arthur fights a man in a hotel hallway with shifting gravity.Because of that, Pixar thought it would be cool to thrust High Octane Nightmare Fuel in their next (supposed) family oriented movie, including a rather gnarly fight between cars in a lube station, cars being destroyed with a laser type machine with the fuel in them, cars being tied up and begging for their lives, a pair of cars being tied to the gears of Big Ben and many others.Aside from that general bit of unpleasantness in this bafflingly G rated movie, nothing happens.No, seriously, nothing happens. Mater essentially drives around blabbering. On sense for essentially 75% of the movie. There is some bullcrap about Mater and an Italian race car and something about British intelligence. But the problem is, both of those sub stories go NOWHERE.One should sincerely hope that Pixar was simply trolling us with even the idea of a Cars 2. Cars had a very mixed reacton from Pixar's overall fan base. It got the lowest rating prior to this movie on Rotten Tomatoes with 74%. And it's box office numbers were just barely average, even by Pixar standards. So with low expectations in place, one could expect a disappointment, and that said, that person is correct.Just avoid this movie. Pixar, hang your heads in shame.",0,0,0,0

R13WGN8BRWSO45,"OUTDATED MATERIAL . Dr Gerson was right.that toxicity due to faulty detoxification is a major cause of cancer. His fame is due to his use of detoxification as a major aspect of cancer therapy. The cancer clinics that have the greatest effects have detoxification as a major component of their therapy.  The  Coffee enemas used by Dr Gerson are very effective for detoxification. But a deficiency of coffee is not the reason the patients immune system stopped being able to eliminate all the toxins in the first place.SUGAR CAUSES IMMUNE SUPPRESSION Immune suppression is also an important cause of cancer.  Excess sugars from any source including fresh fruit causes excessive insulin production and excessive adrenal hormone production (to help the body burn up all the excess sugars). Both insulin and Adrenalin suppress the bodies immune system and detoxification system. Insulin is directly suppressive of immune function. Diabetics and people with insulin resistance have a 300% increased incidence of cancer. The body switches off the detoxification system when there is high adrenal hormones in the system and turns it back on when we are resting. A constant barrage of sugars from fruit juice keeps the adrenal hormones high and the detoxification system turned of for about 18m hours a day in most people.In addition  cancer needs sugars to grow and metastasize. Dr Gerson didn't know that all sugars feed cancer. He incorrectly thought it was only processed white sugar and not fructose from fruit. The tumor doesn't care whether its white sugar or the natural stuff in apple and carrot juice. Antioxidant deficiencies can cause the immune system to malfunction, but we can get a lot more of the polyphenols and other antioxidants from a capsule of grape skin extract than we can from a gallon of apple juice.ENZYMES? The ones that are most effective for fighting cancer are the pancreatic enzymes now available in products like Wobenzyme N. It was the enzymes in the fresh liver juice  that Dr Gerson  used that were the effective enzymes against cancer. The vegetable enzymes in fruit and vegetable juice have been found to be ineffective for cancer. As a result of what has been learned since Dr Gerson's time has caused other practitioners to emphasize green juices like wheat grass, spinach, kale, swiss chard etc .  My point is that Dr Gerson had some great theories but the use of fruit and vegetable juices high in natural sugar was counter productive. (I am opposed to chemo, and radiation for cancer) If the Gerson therapy was effective for the vast majority of people I would be in favor of it . But its not that effective. Other alternative practitioners have cut back on the quantity of fruit, carrot and beet juice and had improved results. The reason the tumor is growing rapidly is due to the sugar you are feeding it. You need time for natural detoxification therapies to work. So you need to get the tumor to slow its growth.  The easiest least invasive way to slow the tumor growth to get more time  is to go on a no sugar, no fruit, no starch, low protein, KETOGENIC diet. We see a lot of false ketogenic diets being written about that allow normal amounts of protein intake. Not effective. The body can convert amino acids from proteins into sugar and keep the blood sugar higher than is needed for an anti cancer program that will help everyone. Some people can eat more protein than others and still have a sub normal blood sugar of 55-65. Dr Mercolacom has an article online ""The Benefits of a Ketogenic Diet and Its Role in Cancer Treatment."" Also Sugar Identified As a Top Cause of The Surge in Cancer. Dont take my word for it.  Read about the facts discovered by Thomas Seyfried PhD.SUPER IMMUNE SYSTEM STIMULANTS ? There are these people who don't understand the physiology of how the human body works that will recommend immune system stimulating MUSHROOMS, Paw Paw, etc.  These are wonderful products if your immune system isn't suppressed by excessive levels of insulin and adrenalin. But not very effective if it is. Everyone wants a simple fix. But there isn't one. You have to address the cause of a condition, not just try to take a magic pill. I have know people to go into remission. Believe they were cured and go back to their old ways of eating and come back down with cancer in a year or two.SUGAR FROM FRUIT All foods containing sugars including natural sugars are rapidly absorbed, which causes an over secretion of insulin that is very immune suppressive. The over secretion of insulin is primarily a result of how fast the sugars are absorbed into the blood stream. Natural sugars in juices like fresh carrot juice and apple juice are very rapidly absorbed because the fiber present in the whole food has been removed.  They cause large secretions of insulin that paralyzes the immune system so it can't fight the cancer or the candida fungus. The glycemic index is a measure of how much carbohydrate is in a food and does not just focus on the speed of the carbohydrate absorption that is considered the most important factor by a small number of researchers. Over secretion of insulin is necessary for candida fungus to thrive. Eating green vegetables that are broken down into carbohydrates over 4 or more hours does not spike insulin levels and therefore does not create the immune suppression that candida needs to multiply. In Dr Gerson’s day the prevalence of candida was less because the sugar consumption was less.65 years ago the majority of people did not have blood sugar regulation issues and so were better able to tolerate  all the high sugar juices in Dr Gerson program. Now over 80% of patients have blood sugar regulation issues. If its high blood sugar we know that all these sugars from fresh fruit juice isnt good because diabetics and pre diabetics have a 400% higher chance of coming down with cancer. If a person has low blood sugar we know that fruit juice and carrot juice sends them into a hormonal roller coaster ride as the body dumps excessive amounts of insulin in a over reaction to the high blood sugar. This hormonal roller coaster ride causes inflammation and immune suppression. Cancer is an inflammation driven disease.Then there is the candida fungus problem. 65 years ago it was less common. But now according to Mark Sircus and others its very common occurring in as many as 3 out of every 4 cancer patients. Candida fungus grows so rapidly and is such a powerful immune suppressor that fighting it is actually the primary objective. If you can get rid of the candida and immune suppression from insulin the cancer is much easier to control.KETOGENIC DIET Tripping over The Truth by Christofferson discusses the medical research showing that cancer is a metabolic disease not a genetic disease. Toxins are responsible for the primary metabolic dysfunction. The toxins damage the mitochondria and this causes cancer to start. But once started  the cancer needs large amounts of sugar to survive and multiply.  It has been proven with radioactive labeled fructose that the cancer tumor does utilize fructose and other sugars in fruit for energy production and growth.  The ketogenic diet by eliminating fruit, grains and starches can lower the blood sugar to a low enough level that the cancer's growth is often stopped. This makes the cancer more vulnerable to all the alternative anti cancer treatments such as hyperbaric oxygen, ozone, ect. Christofferson cites the research of Thomas Seyfried (Cancer as a Metabolic Disease)  that showed that anything that raises blood sugar including sugars from fresh fruit and root vegetables feeds cancer. So Instead of drinking high in natural sugar fruit juices one wants a low sugar and low carbohydrate but high natrual healthy fat diet (Ketogenic) to beat cancer as described in these books. COCONUT Oil is the best natural fat. The meat of Christoffersons book is in appendix A where he describes how to do the ketogenic diet. Miriam Kalamian has an e-book on the ketogenic diet and information on her web site http://www.dietarytherapies.com/  The Charlie foundation.org has info on the ketogenic diet for cancer. Amazon has a number of other keto books. Some of the  books on the Keto diet reccomend  fried and other heat damaged food that are counter indicated for cancer. The keto diet starves the cancer tumor of the food it needs to grow. By cutting out almost all sugars and carbs it stops the spikes in insulin that suppress the immune system. But by itself it is incomplete. One needs to use something like coffee enemas to detoxify and herbs, enzymes, ozone etc to kill the cancer once the keto diet has weakened the cancer by starvation.So why did the Gerson Therapy work for some people? First if you can detoxify the body you can often beat the cancer if toxins were the cause. Coffee enemas are a powerful detoxifier. Speeding up bowel transit time is a major way to increase by over 10 times the amount of toxins getting out of the body. Its possible that the positive effects of the coffee enemas outweighed the negative effects of the high sugar juices. Also Dr Gerson used fresh squeezed liver juice that is no longer being used in the present form of the Gerson therapy.Dr Joseph Issels MD studied what Gerson and other doctors were doing for cancer and came up with a synergistic approach that was individualized for each patient. His German clinic had a higher recovery rate than Dr Gerson did. But his emphasis was on determining the cause of the cancer. He did not assume it was just from nutritional deficiency or toxins.  Often he found it was from vaccines, dental work, emotional upsets, allergies, chemical toxins, or even more unusual causes. His experience was that as necessary as good nutrition and detoxification was, the cause of the cancer had to be addressed. If it was emotional then creative arts therapy and counseling was usually necessary. Acupuncture was very useful when emotional causes were responsible for the shutting down of the immune system. If the death of a loved one shuts down the immune system you cant get it going again with juices and detoxification. You have to address the emotional component. If it was allergic the source of the allergen had to be identified and removed. If toxic dental work is influencing the meridians then corrective dental work was required. He saw tumors stop growing often within 3 days of the completion of corrective dental work. There is a branch of the meridian system that goes to every tooth. Biological dentists have this chart to help determine if the rest of the body is being affected by a problematic tooth. Dr Issels was known for his emphasis on correcting dental focie of infection.by pulling all root canalled teeth. He did not have a signature dietary therapy he used. All treatments were individualized. He used coffee enemas but lots of even more powerful detoxification measures like ozone therapy, saunas, and fever therapy. Dr Issels borrowed from all the other natural cancer therapies available in his day to come up with a wide variety of modalities to deal with different types of cancer. There is a tremendous difference between the amount of time various alternative cancer clinics will spend on trying to determine why one developed cancer.  Dr Issels was  a dedicated doctor who  was not well liked by other alternative practitioners because his high success rate made them look bad.  My point is there is a tremendous difference in the results when one has a doctor that can determine the cause of ones cancer and create a program to correct it, as opposed to having no idea what caused it and deciding that you are going to try the Gerson therapy because it has helped a lot of people. If your cancer has happened 1-4 years after an serious emotionally trauma then that is usually the cause. The bad diet can be a result of dealing with unresolved feelings and is a secondary cause of the cancer.  Lee Cowden  teaches the Dr Hammer method (from Germany) for dialoging with cancer patients to uncover emotional causes of cancer . His web site is acimconnect.com and he has a find a practitioner function on the web site.Dr Issels knew of Dr Gersons therapy and tried the large amounts of carrot and apple juice on patients. He then tested for the immune system status after 3 day on the juices and again after 6 days of juices. This extensive lab testing did not show that the several quarts of these very sweet juices were helping improve immune system function. He actually found that the large amounts of juices were depressing immune function. He found smaller amounts of green vegetable juices to be more beneficial. There were a lot of other modalities that would work to improve immune system status so these others modalities were tried and then blood work was taken after 3 days to see if they worked for this particular patient. Much has been said about the enzymes in vegetable juices. But by the 1960's enzyme capsules were available and could be taken for their beneficial effects in a sugar free form. There are fruit antioxidants tablets that contain more of the powerful polyphenols and antioxidant nutrients than a gallon of fruit juice. So you can get the inflammation reducing effects without all the fruit sugar. Celery, kale, cucumber, spinach, cabbage, broccoli, and other green juices have a lot of vital nutrients with less than one tenth of the sugars of carrot and apple juice. If Dr Gerson was alive today I think he would have changed his program to accommodate the increase in sugar sensitivity of today’s people. I am also sure he would have incorporated the emotional and psychological aspects that have been found to be useful by many of the alternative cancer clinics.We need to stop worshiping the past and instead learn from it and improve on it as Dr Issels did. In the 1990's Dr Issels considered that the KETOGENIC diet was so revolutionary that his book ""Cancer A Second Opinion"" was made obsolete and would have to be extensively rewritten.BUDWIG DIET  CBudwig used cold pressed Flax oil and raw quark (cottage cheese) .  Raw quark (cottage cheese) has a considerable amount of the amino acid cysteine that the body needs to make glutathione. The body cant detoxify itself without glutathione. But pasturized cottage cheese has lost a lot of this amino acid and had a lot of other vital nutrients damaged. But we can now buy liposomal glutathione or N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) or low heat whey protein concentrate to get the cysteine.  NAC is stabilized so as to boost blood glutathione levels more efficiently. One capsule of NAC.will give you more than a whole cup of raw cottage cheese/quark and without the allergy or antibiotic problem. CBD Hemp oil is even more powerful than regular hemp oil.  It is available in pill form in very therapeutic concentrations. Foods Alive is the only company i know of that sells a raw Flax oil like Budwig used. It is heated to no more than 108 degrees Fahrenheit. Omega nutrition says they keep the temperature below 122 degrees on thir flax oil. All the other health food companies uses higher heat because they can get more oil out of the seeds with higher heat. Cold pressed is not scientifically defined by the USDA so a companie's  claim of cold pressed is not a guarantee it hasn't been heat damaged. .Still want to do the Gerson therapy? Then move to California and buy your vegetables from small organic growers. The problem is that big organic growers may follow the rules but then they sell to a jobber who comes in with workers and semi trucks who dont have to follow any rules. its a loop hole in the organic standards act. They  harvests the whole field and then sells it to a big chain retailer. Often the jobbers sell to an East coast buyer so they drop the vegetables off at the airport and they are flown across the country without refrigeration.  The parsley I can buy in an East coast health food store looks fresher that home grown parsley that is a day old. How do they do that? Don’t be naive and think organic certification will give you pristine uncontaminated vegetables that are flown across the country without refrigeration. In Dr Gerson's day they didn't do to vegetables what they do now.  If you want to avoid this problem you have to buy from small farms that not only grow the vegetables organically but also harvest them and also ship them directly to you. That keeps the vegetable in the hands of people who have to follow the  organic standards act from start to finish.  But prices can be much much more than what organic vegetables cost in big health food chain stores. Alfalfa sprouts contain something that makes them unsafe in large quantities so you shouldn't juice alfalfa sprouts.APPLE JUICE? What about the quality of apple used for juice? Before the chemical pesticides came into use lead arsenate was used to kill the apple worms. Being a mineral/metal it stays in the soil so all the orchards that were used to grow apples before 1950's have soil that is contaminated with arsenic. Most organic apples are grown on land that had been previously used to grow commercial apples and therefore contain arsenic picked up from the contaminated soil. You have to find organic apple growers that grow their apples on land  that was not used to grow apples previously, if you want to avoid this potent carcinogen. Recently a study came out indicating that arsenic is 17-18 times more carcinogenic than previously thought.  Arsenic is also found in organic brown rice, commercial rice, commercial eggs, and commercial chicken.I  have read Dr Gerson’s book The Results of 50 Cases and it seemed like there was a considerable variation in what each patient's program.was it was not the  the standardized  approach Charlotte Gerson has created. My impression of his book was that Dr Gersons approach was a work in progress and not the final word on how to treat cancer.The fanatical adulation of the Gerson therapy interfere with a progressive mind set that enables one to see what works and change the therapy to achieve better results. If Dr Gerson were alive today he would be trying these new approaches and not stubbornly doing what had been done 65 years ago. The sign of a great mind is the ability to improve upon ones methods and incorporate new discoveries into ones work with patients. It is unfortunate that Dr Gerson did not live longer.DEFEAT CANCER  by Connie Strasheim discusses what 15 alternative cancer clinics are doing for cancer. many are using insulin potentiation therapy as a first line approach rather than  a late stage attempt when nothing else works. Some of the other doctors do nutritional intravenous drips but not much detoxification. Sadly others have no emotional component to their therapy.  As a result you need to scrutinize them and pick one that uses the therapies one needs.  From reading the book it seems that very few regularly use the  Ketogenic diet.",0,0,0,0

The script tries way too hard to be ""hip"" in the Scream fashion, but even if you assume that's a valid aspiration, it fails miserably. There's a lot of really silly comic relief, and if you rent this movie looking for a few good scares, forget it, they aren't here. The only real bright spot in the production is Christina Ricci, who delivers by far the best performance and tries to make her character work as something other than a joke--if only a few of her co-stars had taken a similar approach.

R1ZIS083UPZ6UQ,"Let's face it folks, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back is not a good film. Originally slated to be Smith's farewell to his viewaskew universe, JASBSB is a crude and insipid film that has not aged well at all. The titular characters, Jay and Silent Bob, previously appeared in Smith's films as comic relief side characters. They appeared alongside the protagonists and provide humor to offset the tension and drama and occasionally help move the plot forward. With this film being planned as the conclusion to the viewaskew universe it isnt hard to see that this movie is a fan service flick for fans who hung on from Clerks. Unfortunately, fan service is all it really sets out to achieve.I can still remember how I first encountered these two and this movie. Me and my younger brother were watching Comedy Centrals late night program ""Secret Stash"" (incidentally the name of Smith's comic store) which aired films in their uncensored form. As soon as the film began I was in hysterics. My 12 year old self had never been exposed to this kind of raunchy unfiltered comedy before. The way these two strange stoners spoke (or rather how Jay spoke) was how me and my peers talked as kids trying to seem edgy brandishing swear words we heard our parents use. The next day after school I immediately went to Best Buy and purchased the 2 disc DVD set and watched it again, laughing equally as hard. That was 15 years ago, and as what happens to most people as the years go by, my taste in comedy changed. Stuff like explicit language and sexuality no longer held the forbidden allure they once had when I was a child. When I returned to this movie a few years ago, those things and outdated references were sadly all I found.The aged comedy is another point that needs to be discussed. Can any Smith die hards really say that young people today will actually find references to Dawson's Creek, American Pie, Scream, and Good Will Hunting, funny content? I understand Smith loves pop culture, but as is the case with other films that mix in pop culture carelessly, the humor eventually loses its audience. Eventually all you're left with are Jason Biggs and James Vanderbeek and no idea as to why the movie is presenting these two as funny.I really can't say I recommend this movie at all. Maybe if you're 12 and these types of situations are still mysterious and taboo it will hold some interest. Though if you are 12 you're likely unfamiliar with Smith's previous work up until Strikes Back, and also are unaware of the pop culture Smith is referencing from nearly 20 years ago, in which case I dont think even 12 year olds will enjoy this anymore. I dont think this movie really has an audience (beyond Kevin Smith worshippers) that will care anymore.As time goes by the more I look back at Smith's filmography the more pronounced his flaws as a writer and filmmaker become. It sucks saying that in a way because one of these two stars is for the nostalgia I once had not just for this film but Smith as well. The second star is for the few quotables this movie contains which thanks to memes has made it slightly relevant. Unless you're morbidly curious though, I wouldn't waste your time with Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back.",0,0,0,0

R1KN6JUEFN56G6,"I'm giving this 5 stars because once you get it working it works great! For such a cheap price as well. Let me give you the run down and how I set it up.First of all. It is about impossible to set up without a computer despite the manual (which isn't included in the box) saying you can set it up using the WPS button on your router and on the machine. Despite trying many times, I could not get it to work. Perhaps it is just in my situation as my multiple routers in the house were not set up properly and I had to fix them so I could use this printer properly (my own fault/laziness).Once I gave up I connected it to a computer and downloaded the program off the HP website (its a Samsung/HP printer) I connected it with USB (included in the box and I tried and failed using the wireless option) which installed the drivers (unnecessary, I'll get to that in a bit) but more importantly assigned the credentials of the wireless network of my choosing to the printer.After that I was essentially done! Anyone connected to the router that the printer was connected to could see the printer and print from it. This works regardless of whether you're on the 5ghz band or the 2.4ghz band, though the printer itself connects to the 2.4ghz, you can discover it on either. We have many devices in our home. For mobile phones it works with or without the app. On iOS or Android you can, in any app, simply choose print functionality integrated right into the operating system. For Mac computers it was just as easy, literally just open a document and select print and it will find the printer. For windows there's an extra step necessary, you simply have to go to devices and printers and add it. Then it's ready to use. I installed the drivers on two of the computers in the house and left the rest without and see no difference in print quality, speed, or functionality.Lastly, we have three routers in the house. If you want the printer to be able to print across multiple routers you're going to have to have them set up as access points. Normally one can extend their wireless signal simply by having multiple routers connected and with the same credentials. However access points are slightly different in that the routers speak to each other and you only have one router handing out IP's. It's very easy to do. Just turning off two or so options on all but the main router and connecting the ethernet via the ethernet ports and not the internet one.Edit ———————————————————Fuser died at one month.

R1JZMZFX0MX3VJ,"Previously, I have given this item four stars.  It's been a year now that I've been using the pencils, and I've finally declared the experiment a failure.  I've given up and revoked my 4-star rating & downgraded to a 2-star.The pencils are fine, when they work.  But the quality control just isn't there.  The last pack of pencils I bought all failed within 2 weeks.  That's a loss of 5 pencils in half a month.  And that's abysmal.  I've had other pencils jam or fail to advance at a rate of about 1 every two weeks.  At the costs I've calculated at the bottom of this review, I can buy standard 4B pencils at almost half the cost of one of these and it will last the same two weeks.It's a shame, because I really wanted this to work out.  I really like the idea, but the build quality just isn't there.  I cannot recommend this pencil.Here is the original review, if you are still interested:This is the second pack of these I've purchased.  The first pack was of two - one stopped working after a few weeks, and the second was stolen.  I've been using my latest pencil for a few weeks and can provide a pretty definitive report on the two samples I've used for the past month, I think.The casing on these pencils is plastic, of course, and I found it difficult to get a grip on them at first.  They look like wood, but aren't, and I think I had to teach myself how to hold them so they don't slip out of my fingers, the friction coefficient on plastic being different than the wood they look like but aren't.  Maybe it was just me.The eraser is permanently attached to the end - you can't change it.  That's a bummer, because you can't put in a new eraser when the one attached wears out.  But if you are using a mechanical pencil in the first place, you probably don't make that many mistakes to begin with.  Mechanical pencils are not for the error-prone.  That being said, the erasers are pretty tough.  They work well, with very little wear.  I think it is highly unlikely that you would wear out the eraser in the lifetime of the pencil.  And if you think you would, then go back to a regular disposable pencil - mechanical pencils are clearly not your thing.The automatic feed is great, most of the time.  I like that I don't have to advance the pencil lead, or worry if it is too long - the pencil takes care of it.  Sometimes it advances it a little too far, but not so far that it becomes a problem.  The feed is a little short more often, forcing you to write straight up, instead of at a more natural angle.  This usually rectifies itself as you write, so no big worries.Damp paper/conditions have an adverse affect.  Sometimes, when I try to write on damp paper, the automatic feed doesn't work right, and I have to jab the paper to get the lead to advance.  It's not a big deal, and it doesn't happen often, but it does happen occasionally, especially in my line of work, so I keep a backup handy.You can't see the progression of the lead.  Most mechanical pencils are clear, so you can judge how short the lead is, and when it might be time to change it.  This pencil is opaque, so you have to guess when the lead needs to be changed.  I've found that you need to just use it until it stops working, then change the lead.  Changing the lead is easy, just unscrew the top, drop in a new one, and screw it closed, but there is absolutely no warning that the lead will fail.  And that leads me to my last, and biggest complaint:The automatic feed does not use all of the lead.  Unlike most mechanical pencils that will use a lead down to a nubbin, the automatic pencil leaves a considerable amount of unused lead when it stops writing.  I suspect that it's something about how much lead the automatic system needs to operate being much more than a manual pencil needs.  It's not that big of a deal because you get four leads with each pencil, and leads aren't that expensive anyway, but it is surprising how much lead is ejected from the pencil when you reload it after it stops writing.I've read complaints about short lifespan with these pencils.  I've only had one pencil fail on me after a few weeks of daily use, so I'm not in a position to comment on it.  I think that the idea behind these pencils is to have it be cheap and easy enough to use that you don't mind losing one from time to time, rather than an being an expensive, high-performance pencil, that you will kick yourself if you lose it.  And if you are in a place where your pencil might be stolen or lost, then better a 2$ one than a 20$ one, right?  Besides, I like the simplicity of the pencil itself.  No buttons, no clips - just a standard No. 2 that never goes dull.  Outstanding.UPDATE: So I've been using these pencils since mid-July.  I've since had 5 pencils break, and one that was stolen.  So, doing the math, (4 months[rounded] x 30 days[avg mo.] = 120[days]/5[pencils lost due to wear, not counting the stolen one] = 3.4 weeks average pencil life.  At the current price of a 5-pack, you would spend 2.50$ every three+ weeks, or the entire amount of 12.52$ every 4 months, given the rate of attrition.  For me, that's a good deal, especially when I always have a sharp point and don't have to waste time constantly sharpening up a pencil.  I replaced the standard HB lead with a B lead and the pencils work much better under the harder conditions I subject them too.  I stick with my four star rating because the basic shortcomings outlined above have not been overcome by Ticonderoga.  I would still recommend this item.",0,0,0,0
R3O6FYVQUPFYSC,"When I first got the dry erase board, I wasn't impressed.  The letters on the days were already faded and the cork board had several ""bubbles"" in it where it looked like it hadn't been glued to the backing.  Also, one of the round magnets (with the plastic covering you use on the board) did not stick to its plastic backing.  But whatever, I was going to use it anyways.After reading all the other reviews about the poor adhesive on the backing magnets (to stick to your fridge), I decided to super glue the magnets to the back.  HUGE MISTAKE!!!  Now, I'm not blaming anyone but myself for this error - I should have researched a proper glue to use on the back.  I just want to share my experience so it doesn't happen to anyone else.  Well I must have put too much glue or should have used a different glue, because the glue had a chemical reaction to my refrigerator.  Seriously!?!?  I had let the glue dry for at least an hour before putting the board on my fridge. I don't know, I had cleaned the fridge before putting the board on - maybe the glue had a reaction to the chemicals in the cleaner - even though I let both of them dry first?  I'm not sure.  Anyways, my black fridge now has 4 areas where the magnets were that are white (the magnets left rectangle markings).  It looks horrible!  Again, not blaming anyone but myself.  If you are going to glue the magnets to the back, DON'T USE SUPERGLUE.  Find another adhesive.  Anyways, all is not lost - we were planning on replacing the refrigerator this fall anyway and my husband jokes that I sabotaged our fridge on purpose to ensure I would get a new one...lol.Because I glued the magnets on the back and had that horrible reaction, into the garbage it went.

R1OCJC9GZJ548E,"**Updating my review after more months of use: This specific model is terrible. It's been a few months and each time I use it (maybe once a month) it makes my hair terribly brittle and breaks apart, something that at first use it didn't seem to do. It barely heats (still) and is overall a cheap piece of garbage. If you want a good quality hair result, this won't be the one for you. I took my review from three stars to one. It's that crappy.** This brand came highly recommended by my hairstylists over the years, so I went for it with the lower-cost model as a test drive of sorts. It gets the job done & one BIG PLUS is that my hair does not feel dry, brittle, & dead at the ends. I only use flat irons for beach wave style curls, so it does well enough in that regard, but it isn't perfect. Even at the highest heat setting it feels like it barely heats so the look I have gone for with this flat iron isn't achieved entirely, which is frustrating (hence the three stars). I've only had this for a month, so naturally I've got some time to play around with it and figure it out. It hasn't been a total waste of money, so we'll see how it goes. I have a BaBylist Pro hairdryer so I am into the brand in general. :)",0,0,0,0
R3TEG0GFR7ZUUG,"I was excited when I got this book because I noticed in the biblio that the author is about the same age myself, and that was encouraging to me. I am into writing fantasy a bit myself (and am an English major) but it had never occured to me that I might try to publish anything myself aside from short stories locally. But, after reading this book, all I could think was: ""Man, if all it takes to get some fame is to be really young and write THIS good, I should write a fantasy trilogy myself!"" I was not impressed with the book. As other reviewers have said, the book is so reminiscent of Star Wars and LOTR in certain palces that it just makes me want to cringe. The book does not flow well, the descriptions are way to in depth in places (really, the book is not 500+ pages long...had it been properly edited it would half been about 250 pages long), and the whole writing style is somewhat choppy and unnatural. What I mean is, its as if this book was written by 100% effort and 0% natural talent, like an advanced computer scanned Star Wars books, LOTR books, and other fantasy works and then puked out Eragon, mixing story elements of the above mentioned an changing names here and there. I get the feeling that a robot wrote it because it is so unoriginal. Paolini, please, next time, don't write so mechanically, just let it flow. If you have true, natural talent, it should manifest itself NATURALLY!Don't get me wrong, I give two stars because I still respect Paolini for writing so young and trying so hard to become a known author. I think that its very liike that, later on, Paolini will produce some solid work. But this is lame. You can tell it was written by a 15-year old. The characters are unnattractive and two-dimensional, and the author apparently has some strange aversion to the word ""said"". The ending to the book is so predictable that you're hitting yourself on the head with the book in the last pages, shouting, ""Why? Why?""I think that this author should have started out working for a video game company writing storylines for RPGs. Its ok for RPGs to have hackneyed plots and storylines. Eragon would have made for a fun video game! But a book...sorry...When I was 15, and younger, I started writing fantasy novels too on my computer to indulge my creativity, most of which were very much in the fashion of LOTR, etc, like Eragon. Had never occured to me to publish any of them, but after reading Eragon, again, I couldn't help but think that I might want to dig up those old computer files and send them to a publisher!",0,0,0,0
RT4CFIS8IAD4X,"I have mixed feelings about this book. I started eating clean about 3 months ago and have dropped 24 lbs doing it my way (eating when I'm hungry, stopping when I'm satisfied, exercising regularly), and decided to give this interesting concept of ""restarting"" my metabolism a shot. The food and principles themselves are not the issue. The amount of food she requires you to eat is what bothers me. That isn't natural, and if you do it her way, it isn't what your body is telling you to do. Shoveling down several cups of spinach as well as 8 ounces of protein in one setting (however delicious they may be) stretches your stomach, which sets you up for overeating at your next meal, and whether or not the food is clean or ""dirty"", overeating is NEVER the answer to losing weight or resetting anything in your body.I like her recipes and I like how she incorporates grains and fruits, but overall, the promise of making you skinny by ""DOING EXACTLY THIS"" isn't going to work for everyone.

R39P2L6R8MRADQ,"I bought this printer after a decent amount of research done by myself, consumer reports, and different printer spokesmen that come to retailers to talk up their products from their specific companies.  Also conducted many investigative research with long-time employees from different retailers who know their printer stuff.  The general consensus was that with the Lexmark Pinnacle Pro 901, you pay a decent amount up front, but the money saved over time with the market leading low cost black ink cartridges is greater.  Wasn't looking for a great color printer, as we almost always print black ink only documents. Also obviously wanted the wireless technology, among other new common technologies that come with all-in-one printers.  Great. Sold.After a week of moderate black ink printing, a page comes out LITERALLY DRENCHED with blue ink (cyan cartridge).  Being objective, I went through all the common solutions that may attribute to the problem.  No solutions were listed on the Lexmark website for this issue, which is amazing considering the amount of attention this particular problem as garnered with this particular printer.  I checked to make sure the print-head was securely locked into place, and made sure the ink cartridges were locked into place.  Made sure the firmware was up to date.  Also followed the on-screen HELP feature to 'clean' and 'wipe' the print-head.  Tried again, same issue.  So much ink had bleed out that the inside of the printer had a film of cyan ink covering it.  A paper towel ROLL later, the mess was cleaned up, and I inserted a NEW cyan cartridge.  Same thing happened again.  I cleaned up the mess once more and unplugged the unit and opened it up (to hopefully let the ink dry up from parts unable to get to with towel to clean) for a week.  The next week i start it up and print a black document, and get blue streaks and block-like blotches and blue track marks everywhere.During my initial research of this printer, I had read a few reviewers who came across this problem.  At the time there were not that many reviews relating to this problem, so I chucked it up to isolated incidents.  A mere 2 months later as the date of this review, new research shows that this has now become an overwhelming issue with many Lexmark Pinnacle 901 users.  So much so that the replaceable print head for this product is unavailable and on back-order due to high demand for replacements.Took the printer to Best Buy (initial retailer of purchase) without the box and described the problem.  They gladly took it back and gave us the $200 in-store credit to choose a new printer.  Luckily a comparable HP model was on sale for $149.99 and even CAME WITH INK.  Sure the HP ink costs more, but I need not go through the pain of not having a printer and waiting on a replacement print-head to be made available and to possibly keep going through this problem.  The Lexmark Pinnacle 901 is NOW discontinued by the way, most likely due to this fast growing popular print-head problem.The new HP all-in-one offers all the same new technology, but also offers remote printing from cell phone, iPad, iPhone, or even office via the printer's personal e-mail address.  Very cool.  HP set up was much easier with the wireless networking and remote networking.  HP prints over wireless network much quicker than the Lexmark did.  HP starts wireless printing almost instantly, where the Lexmark Pinnacle 901 took a good 20-30 seconds before it activated from wireless print.I Think the Lexmark Pinnacle would have been a GREAT all-in-one wireless printer had it not been for the print head issues that has now overwhelmed the product and has now gotten itself discontinued.  Too bad.  Now HP reigns supreme in our home.",0,0,0,0

R2H9NOMM2BGPLB,"Sometimes for whatever reason a book doesn’t work for me as a reader and book reviewer. The vast majority of books I read are quite enjoyable which is why 95% of the time the reviews I post for you are positive. But in the true spirit of reviewer-ship, I’ve got to give you the good with the bad. When I say bad, remember that book enjoyment is subjective. In fact, this book has won a bunch of awards and is listed as one of the top sellers on Amazon! So long story short, you may love this one but unfortunately it was a miss for me.I enjoyed that it was a short story, but the lack of dialogue and character development really threw me. Some people will enjoy that the relative anonymity makes the story relatable as if it could happen to anyone, but I really enjoy meeting characters and immersing myself in their lives by getting to know them better. That helps me care about their stories and want to continue reading. I skimmed through this book because I did not feel a connection to anyone. Remember, I LOVE disaster, post apocalyptic, pre-apocalyptic, and anything related to societies collapse type novels. My husband always give me a hard time about that because he thinks its strange that I enjoy reading about everything collapsing. Ha! Nonetheless, they are my jam.

R2QUMWHJP51AQB,"This review is based on reading the Prologue and Chapters One, Two and Three. Really, you don't need to read further to gauge the quality of this novel.In the beginning of Chapter Two, which introduces John Scali's self-proclaimed favorite character he ever wrote, the character, Kiva Lagos, is described vulgarly in the process of sexually exploiting a subordinate.  Amazon took out this excerpt from the ""Look Inside"" material. Also, Amazon apparently doesn't allow obscenities in reviews, even if you're quoting directly from the book.

He stops the action to info dump leaden paragraphs of what you need to know to understand what's going on. This is an amateur's mistake and deadly in fiction. There are only three ways to handle exposition:GET IT OVER WITH – Best done at the very beginning of the story or chapter. Very popular until the mid 20th Century before readers were conditioned by TV and movies to have attention spans measurable in seconds. Has the advantage of efficiency because a lot of information and backstory can be conveyed as the reader is not yet engaged in the story itself and so is more receptive. Think of how commercials shown before a movie are tolerable, but if they interrupted ROGUE ONE for even one Super Bowl quality commercial, theaters would burn.HIDE IN PLAIN SIGHT – Weave it  into the warp and woof of the story’s fabric and hope nobody notices. This is extremely difficult, akin to composing a four voice fugue, which is why lesser writers don’t even attempt it.FICCIOUNUS INTERRUPTUS- The worse way: Stop the action, with or without warning, expect the reader to hold still while you inform him what he needs to know before proceeding to the…er, climax of the story. As might be expected, this is jarring, frustrating, and may lead to a loss of interest and withdrawal.Scalzi chose the last method and I suspect both he and his readers will be screwed.",0,0,0,0

R11HZ5JG5G411I,"The first time I bought one of these carts was about 2 years.  I used it to go grocery shopping, about a 4-mile round-trip for me, up and down a lot of hills. I buy a lot of food at one time because the trip is exhausting and this cart generally carried it all very well.  It folded nicely and was easy to store.  It was great!About 1 year after owning it, one of the wheels fell off on a shopping trip.  I managed to save it and get the cart home again.  I repaired the wheel with a simple screw and it worked fine for another year.About 2 months ago on a grocery trip, another wheel fell off.  This time I could *not* find the lost wheel, so I could not repair the cart again.  I ordered a new one, thinking it would be as great as the old one had been.I WAS WRONG.What I got was a piece of JUNK (I'd used stronger words, but I want this review to be posted.)  The types of wheels had been changed.  Instead of the former rubber ones, these were now plastic.  The problem was these new wheels were TOO BIG for the cart itself!  The cart would no longer fold properly, because it had NOT been redesigned for these larger wheels.  The new wheels also interfered with the ability for the card to move properly!I went on my first grocery shopping trip with the new cart.  Getting the cart there and back was an ongoing problem during the trip because the wheels kept hitting the metal of the cart.I returned home with my food and when I got there, one of the metal supports for a wheel *BROKEN*, nearly collapsing the cart and spilling all my groceries.The cart was RUINED.  It was UNREPAIRABLE.  After using it ONCE!  I threw it out in the trash the next day.  I couldn't stand to see it and think of the money I had wasted.I am on a very-fixed income; the lost of the $20 for this piece of junk cart is money I could not afford to waste.  But this cart is now long gone, taken away in the trash where it belonged in the first place.  It should NEVER have been sold because of the replaceable of the old type of wheels with cheaper ones which did NOT FIT.  Either wheels of the same size as had been previously used for it should have been added - or the metal cart itself should have been redone to properly fit these larger wheels.Now I have to find and buy and pay for another large cart to carry my groceries; I have to find a way to afford it.  You can be certain I will *NOT BUY* a 3rd one of these carts!** UPDATE! **I also posted negative feedback to this seller's account.  A short time after that I got a email from him offering me a full-refund if I would change my negative feedback to positive.I said ""No"".The fact is, this seller is likely going to *keep* selling these shopping cards that are defective as can be seen in the *recent*, very negative reviews here.  He is also likely going to keep selling a lot more of these carts in different colors in other Amazon listings.I'm out my money, which as I said, I truly cannot afford to waste.  However, I am not going to change ANYTHING that might warn people here these carts are seriously defected because changes that were made to the wheels -- and DO NOT BUY ONE!  I can't afford to have waste money of this piece of junk, but I would rather loose that money in the hope that someone else might NOT buy one of these carts because of my review.* * * * * * * * * * *AGAIN, DO NOT BUY THIS CART!  IT IS JUNK!  IT *WILL* BREAK A *VERY* SHORT TIME AFTER YOU START USING IT!* * * * * * * * * * *",0,0,0,0

R1WJV87IWEJO61,"After unpacking, I quickly discovered that the plastic frame -- which is also a hanger bracket -- arrived cracked and broken in the top left corner, which is also the mounting point. It is truly absurd that a mail-order company (the item was shipped in a factory original packaging) is unable to design a box that would adequately protect this fragile item in harsh shipping environment. Here's the problem: there is absolutely no cushioning material (other than the thin cardboard of the box) to protect the board from sliding along the longer edge. Once the item is placed on a hard surface (e.g. my brick porch), even with some moderate impact, it will crack like an egg shell. I do not blame Fedex. They cannot baby every single package they handle. These guys move fast. It is naive of this manufacturer to hope that placing stickers or tape with a label ""fragile"", will do the trick for any delivery guy/gal.Universal(R), fix the packaging!It would cost you say 50 cent to add some cushioning material around all 4 edges to properly immobilize and cushion the board inside the box to protect it from moving around and impacting hard surface. And then you wouldn't have to deal with cost of restocking, returns, fixing and waste! Not to mention bad feedback, disappointed customers, and Amazon having second thoughts if they should deal with the company. It just makes no business sense whatsoever.I'm giving the product 2 stars and not 1, because the board itself is quite nice -- for the price. The surface (in my case) was smooth with no dents. The mounting instructions seemed clear and simple. So, I think (but couldn't say for sure...) that I probably would have been quite happy with the board... if only I had a chance to mount it and use it.And kudos to Amazon for making returns painless. Print out the authorization barcode. Put it into the box. Seal the box and wait for the UPS driver to pick it up tomorrow. No cost on my part. No hassle. Thank you Amazon -- that is exactly why I remain a loyal Prime member.Would I recommend this board? I've seen other reviews of customers complaining along the same lines as I just did... And based on the box I have just witnessed and evaluated myself (I'm an engineer), I estimate your chances at around 50/50: You might get a board which is intact. Or you might get a board which is damaged in shipping... It's a lottery.Shame on the manufacturer for not designing properly protective box. What a waste and inefficiency.",0,0,0,0
R3OJCWX7XMNF3P,"First Sentence: The accused was a wealthy man by the name of Pete Duffy, and his alleged crime was murder.How I Acquired the Book: I borrowed this book from my town's library.*You may not get what I am talking about in this review if you have not read the first two books in the series.*The Review: My fascination with John Grisham first began a few years ago, when I saw my father reading one of his novels. I don't recall which one it was, but it was about a trial and the lawyers, as always. I promised to myself, since I was a kid at the time (still am), that I would read his adult novels when I grew up someday. A few years later, the first Theodore Boone novel came out, and I, as a kid, was instantly drawn to it. I thought, perhaps I wouldn't have to wait that long to read a Grisham novel! And then I read it, and it ended on a cliffhanger, so of course I wanted the second one. When the second one came out, I raced to the library. I read it. And I was so, so, disappointed.Now, I do not claim to know John Grisham's works very well, since, as I stated before, I am a teenager. However, I do know enough that John Grisham is apparently the master of the legal thriller. After reading these three novels in the Theodore Boone series, I have trouble believing that.Why? Well, the first one was fine. It was short and kind of incomplete, but it had some nice Law-and-Order style drama. Why was I disappointed by the second one? Because it had nothing to do with the first one. This third book in the series faces the same problem.The second one focused on a kidnapping. This one focuses on a robbery. But that isn't the reason why I'm so annoyed. The reason is, HE IS NOT FOCUSING ON THE PETE DUFFY MURDER TRIAL. Sure, in the beginning of the book, there's a bit of tension with him. But that's it. Like in The Abduction, Duffy is pushed off to the side and completely forgotten about.Mr. Grisham has to realize that what draws people to his books are the courtroom aspect of it. Perhaps he thinks that with young children, who are the people this book is marketed to, he can get away with delaying it, putting it off; perhaps he even thinks this ramps up the suspense. But it's not working. Just think of it this way: if you heard about Theodore Boone: Kid Lawyer and knew you would have to wait two, possibly three more years for the conclusion to it, would you want to read it? If you knew, the author was going to write filler novel after filler novel in the series, not advancing the plot he started in the first book, would you want to read it?I'll be counting how many books it takes for Mr. Grisham to return to what I started reading Theodore Boone for. I'll be counting how many books it takes for him to realize that changing the subject pointlessly in this series is not what we want. I'll be counting how many books it takes for him to write about the darned Pete Duffy murder trial again. I'll be counting.-reviewed by a teenager.

R3P8WY3E97AO72,"The question is why would Brian Herbert, a respectable sci fi author in his own right, have to partner with Kevin J Anderson, an author who seems to write the most formulaic cookie cutter sci fi ever unleashed on the reading public? Was Herbert unaware of Anderson's crap Star Wars serial novels? I managed to only get through about two of Anderson's Star Wars novels before I gave up. That Lucas would even license the property to Anderson made me predict years in advance that the new movie trilogy was going to suck bag. And I was right!Herbert must have inherited much of his father's fortune, so he's got to have no pressing need for quick cash and more than enough money to let him write proper novels for a living.A lot has been said already in previous review, but let me just air one gripe. Why is everyone running around firing lasguns in this novel when it's also been demonstrated people use shield belts? We're told if a lasgun hits a shield belt, a nuclear explosion results. In Frank's universe, this has resulted in pretty much everyone locking away their lasguns and using knives. However, in House Atreides everyone is firing lasguns madly despite the fact someone might be using an active shield. Does this make sense? It doesn't to me.",0,0,0,0

RITCMCVSU1EDJ,"I've been through ten pages of comments, and thus far no one has mentioned Brendan Flowers's tendency to dip and slide out of tune! I loved Hot Fuss, and was iffy on Sam's Town and now this album, Day and Age, solely because on Hot Fuss, Brendan actually managed to stay in tune 99% of the time. I don't know if it was because his producer before had him on auto-tune, or if he really was paying closer attention to his vocals at the time, or what, but it makes listening to what would be an otherwise pleasantly weird little band turn painful. Whether the lyrics or music are catchy or interesting becomes completely irrelevant if I can't stand listening to the singer because he's slipping out of tune probably once a line.The only explanation I can think of is that all these positive reviews they get are from people who are tone deaf, or who are at least capable of ignoring such terribly out of tune singers....",0,0,1,1

R3O3LEVDZRYG6Z,"I had a very high expectations for this novel after hearing about it's strong showing in the sci-fi novel awards circuit.I was horribly let down.In my first reading of a John Scalzi novel, I found the writing style to often shift unexpectedly from utterly sophomoric to indulgent and tiring.The Collapsing Empire tells the story of a human society some 1000 years after leaving earth, that utilizes an anomaly in space-time known as The Flow to travel to far reaching points throughout the galaxy. The summary on the back of the book promises that mankind has colonized ""innumerable"" worlds. Its actually about 40. Not bad. I guess.The Flow can be thought of as an intergalatic river, with a singular start point at any certain planet and a singular specific end point at another planet for each 'stream' of The Flow.This travel system has led to the creation of The Interdependency, the governing system of the universe, based on the doctrine that no planet can survive on its own.This government has existed for a thousand years. But trouble is afoot as a young scientist and the Emperox of the whole Interdependency discover that The Flow is about to collapse, leaving the 40+ worlds completely isolated, most of which lacking the resources to be self sustainable, and thus leading to the extinction of the human race.Here, is where I'd like to tell you what our young scientist, Marce, and our noble emperor, Cardenia, do to try and stop the coming calamity.  But I can't tell you that. Because they can't stop it.Maybe instead I would tell you about  what these heroes do to prepare mankind to survive. Can't do that either. They never get that far. The whole book amounts to two people discovering something is up, deciding to tell somebody about it, and then going somewhere to do just that. Oh along the way, some poorly motivated 'villains' try to stop them. Mostly just because these villains (a rich family) don't even really know what's even going on.Along the way we meet the only other substantial character in a book with poorly developed characters, Kiva. A spoiled but brilliant rich girl who spends 95% of her scenes arguing  about money and/or swearing like a sailor with a particular fondness for the 'f'-word.The remaining 5% of her scenes are just sex scenes. So there's that.The book ends with a bit of a cliff-hanger, as the only goal met by our poorly defined protagonists is telling people that The Flow is going to collapse. No gameplan beyond that.The book gets that elusive 2nd star from me, because Scalzi created such an unique, admittedly looney, and complex form of government, and also described some unique theoretical sci-fi tech and science.Overall, the book drags on with very little suspense or tension, obnoxiously profane dialogue, and confusing direction, as most of the characters seem to be unsure of what's going on.It was an ambitious attempt at a political thriller weaved into a space opera. But Scalzi is no George R.R. Martin, and the political squabbles (really just a bunch of wealthy people trying their best to really screw over other wealthy people) falls flat. Leaving us with a rather boring instalment.D grade. 2/5 stars.",0,0,0,0

R2PLXENS44S65G,"I think we all need to have our theology challenged now and then, and all of us should hold our eschatological views loosely because we see through a glass darkly. None of us will be sure of the identity of the Antichrist until he sits in the Temple of God and declares himself God.  So I applaud the book for taking on such a challenging subject. Unfortunately the main premise of the book takes great liberty with scripture and misinterprets vast sections of it.The author is a gifted writer and thinks “outside the box.” In the final section of the book, the author compares Islamic eschatological Hadiths to heretical, extra-biblical “Christian” writings of the first several centuries.  The author rather conclusively shows that Islamic eschatology is based to a large extent on these heretical Christian writings.  If the author had based the book on these incredible findings, the book would be a roaring success.If you google book reviews of this book, you will find details of my review that follows.As an example of the large scale misinterpretations in this book, in Chapter One the book attempts to dispute the analysis of Daniel Chapter Two found in Mideast Beast by Joel Richardson, specifically Daniel 2:40.  The traditional view of historic commentators was that this fourth kingdom referred to Rome.  Joel Richardson showed in his book that this verse, better describes Islam for two reasons.  First, Islam conquered each of the preceding kingdoms of the statue (Babylon, Persia and Greece) while Rome only conquered Greece. Second, Islam “crushed” the culture of those they conquered while Rome, rather than crushing the cultures of those they conquered, actually incorporated elements of the conquered cultures into their own.  (for example using Greek as the language of commerce.)White’s book completely ignores the second point. In regard to the first point, the book attempts to argue that the majority of Hebrew translations of Daniel (such as the NIV, NASB, NKJV, etc.) are incorrect and ignores the Greek translations. The author also overlooks a parallel verse (Dan. 2:44) that confirms that Richardson’s interpretation of “crushes” was correct.The book then makes a suggestion that Daniel 2 is a prophecy of the First Coming of Jesus.  It discusses the Rock that destroys the statue found in Dan. 2: 34-35, but it neglects an incredibly important point.  The rock crushes the statue after the “ten toes” are seen.  The vast majority of prophecy teachers claim the ten toes are the ten kings of Revelation 17 and are part of the end time kingdom of the Antichrist.  Clearly Daniel 2 is not a prophecy of the First Coming of Jesus, but of the second coming.Unfortunately, this is only a sampling of the misinterpretations found in Chapter One.  And this is only the first chapter of a long book that, in my opinion, stretches scripture to prove a point.  I applaud the author’s challenge of the Islamic Antichrist position, but in my view, the book falls short of its goal.",0,0,0,0
R3PZW969WAZR1R,"This was a big misstep on Amy's part.

It tries to be touching and deep and talk about REAL topics like consent, body image, self worth, but I don't think many people are buying it with the expectation of it being a soap box for social justice.This book is a huge departure from Amy's usual schtick and it ends up being excruciating, slow, long, and awkward awkward as opposed to her usual funny awkward.

RBJP4C4NL1IMY,"I really wanted to like this journal, because the price is so reasonable and the paper is nice and sturdy - my sharpies don't show through at all!  And the dots even mostly line up across the pages (useful for the monthly spread).  (so 2 stars for that)However, after exactly 1 week of gentle indoor (no traveling) use, without ever having even been carried around in a bag, only by hand around the house (hi, pandemic), the binding has surprisingly cracked (see photo).  It's such a shame because there's a lot to like about this journal.  The paper is almost card-stock thick and very smooth - I've used markers (even Sharpies) on it, with repeated strokes over the same place, and erased many pencil marks, without any deterioration or show-through.However, it is so smooth that my Pilot Frixion pens just slide right off of them without writing, which is a bummer because I specifically bought this journal for bullet-journaling and writing in appointments, which often change at the last moment, so I'd like to be able to use my frixion pens, which are erasable.  The ink just balls up and doesn't write (for the XF) or takes many attempts to produce a splotchy pale line (F or M).  I've never had this problem with these pens before - they write on all normal copy papers, but this paper is quite slick/slippery in its smoothness.  If you have a good-flowing Pilot G-2 XF, they write well on this paper, and so I was willing to overlook this difficulty (no Frixion pens), but the binding broke...  I really wish this binding had held, and pages were not falling out.In addition, as another reviewer noted, the cover does not tightly fit the spine, and does puff out, noticeably, both when open and closed.  Its looseness means you can feel the bumpy binding (that then cracked), so it doesn't feel as professionally made as moleskine or rhodia or even leuchtturm1917.  I was willing to overlook this as a cosmetic issue that was worth it because of the price, but the pages falling out is a no-go.I have contacted the seller, but not yet heard back.

RI6Y4LWJG1NX8,"One star is defined by Amazon as ""I hate it.""  I rated it two stars because I don't like the idea of saying I hate anything. Anyway, the pads don't work very well. They cannot stop my chair mat from sliding. I put eight of them under a 5 foot by 5 foot chair mat, and the chair mat still slides around. It doesn't slide as badly as it did before I put the pads under it, but the pads still allow unacceptable movement.  By way of background the only piece of furniture on my chair mat is an office desk chair which has four plastic wheels in contact with the chair mat. The pads are installed between the chair pad and the carpet. Given the price of the pads, I was disappointed with their performance. I also tried using these pads on a lazy boy that was sliding around too, but no dice, the lazy boy continued to slide also.  All I can say is that these particular pads just don't seem to have enough grip to stop items on top of them from sliding around.",0,0,0,0

RI5N54G8GK4JL,"After reading the entire book, it became known to me that there was no mention of how to treat allergies or AIDS throughout the book at all. That's a surprise, since the back cover clearly states we can learn ""How to combat allergies, obesity, high blood pressure, AIDS, lupus, and other diseases""As far as immune disorders, there is plenty of information of lupus, but as far as AIDS, it's practically never mentioned. No personal stories. No modified version of the plan. AIDS isn't even listed at all in the index under that acronym or any other one might consider it listed under alternatively.For allergies, from the index, we are directed to only two pages with regard to allergies. From page 239, we find: ""Studies have been completed suggesting that people are addicted to simple foods to which they are actually allergic."" She then goes on to say that the Gerson diet is ""intentionally devoid of foods that tend to cause allergies in some people."" So, it's just a matter of not eating anything that isn't in the Gerson diet. That does not amount to substantial content enough to warrant the claim ""how to combat allergies."" It's more like a side effect of a highly restrictive diet trying to make a claim to fame for ""curing"" any ailment its authors (specifically Mrs. Gerson) wish to include.When it comes to the list, certain foods are ""prohibited"" for no reason other than that they taste bad, such as bitter vegetables like kale or spinach. If cooking spinach, Dr. Gerson says (p.53) ""Spinach water is too bitter for use; it generally is not liked and should be drained off."" Don't eat any mustard of carrot greens either (p.104); no explanation given. What about blueberries, which are known to have anti-cancer properties? None of those either. No reason given. (p.98) ""All berries, nuts...are forbidden."" No nuts either, even though those have high doses of omega-3s. Strangely enough, she strongly recommends rolled oats while condemning processed foods of all kinds. By definition, all rolled oats are processed and so are roasted coffee beans, organic or not. (At least one of the three studies cited used green coffee beans, which are not roasted and therefore more natural.)From page 61, we see foods that were not eaten (by percentage of the sample) by the 200 given people who had spontaneous remission of their cancer. Charlotte uses this to say that these people did so by diet alone. The keywords are ""diet alone."" None of them did anything other than change what they eat, which is what, from the title, we expect the program to be based mostly upon. It's far from it.If the cost of a 3 month supply of supplements provided by a Gerson certified clinic gives an idea as to how many other things are involved, let me point out that it is $1,400. In today's dollars, that's at least $500 a month. So much for it being a ""nutritional program."" Those carrots and other veggies on the cover fooled me. And, it's not simply about juicing either. Not any standard or even high quality juicer will do. She insists on a Norwalk juicer, or another one just like it made by one other company. Price tag? $2,500. That's not counting maintenance of the parts and accessories, such as filter bags. She also says we may need a second refrigerator, or, if we can afford it, a walk-in cooler. She hints at it at first as a recommendation, but at the very end of the book, we are finally told (p.325) ""Do not use liquifiers, centrifuges, juice mixers or masters, and so on.""Other oddities and inconsistencies abound. In the critique of other types of juicers (p.119), one of them is labeled inferior because it ""heats up inside,"" which she says tends to damage the enzymatic quality of the juice. So, she fears that somehow the motor of the machine heats up the juice enough to be of concern. But wait, on page 140, we are told that to make the Gerson special Hippocrates soup, ""fresh vegetables are mandatory, stewed in their own juices."" Now it is implied not only that heating is okay but beneficial to the healing properties.As far as being completely natural, it isn't. How natural does ""dessicated pork thyroid gland"" (p.141) sound? But, she states we should not use the synthetic version of the hormone, because it isn't natural.Recommended is bee pollen, which we are told is nonallergenic (p.148), but that ""some patients may exhibit allergies to it."" Her source of this information is ""World's Only Perfect Food: Bee Pollen Bible""As far as the tone of the book, throughout the book, I continually felt I was being lectured. At least once, she is actually rude, referring to addicts (p.236) as ""these unhappy people"" and ""these unfortunate people."" She seems to idolize her father, though rarely referring to him endearingly, instead as ""Dr. Max Gerson, M.D."" His discoveries were actually the result of trial and error, but we are reminded of his ""genius"" over and over. Many things are recommended and then justified with a quote from her father (Max Gerson). So, because he said so, it must be so? Early I listed the example of the 200 people who had spontaneous remission through diet alone, who had never even heard of ""Dr. Max Gerson, M.D."" or his diet and supplement program.One final bit of misinformation is that ""body tissues begin to release accumulated drugs from the cells into the bloodstream."" (p.239) She believes that recreational drugs are stored in the cells of the body. Really? So, drug users are actually getting high during their withdrawal symptoms? She says a coffee enema clears up the ""toxicity.""This brings up the idea of toxicity in general. For whatever reason the coffee enemas bring relief, it isn't due to toxins being released from the body, not even in the case of heavy metals. From Steven Gundry's book ""Diet Evolution"" ( Dr. Gundry's Diet Evolution: Turn Off the Genes That Are Killing You and Your Waistline ), we learn of his experiences as a surgeon with people who have had gastric bypass surgery. All of them lose massive amounts of fat afterwards, but nobody complains of ""withdrawal symptoms"" when those heavy metals are released from the fat cells in their bodies.From that same book, Dr. Gundry states that vegetables expose us to small amounts of plant toxins, which are designed to protect the plant from being eaten. An animal that gets sick after eating one would rather eat something else. There is of course of cases of animals, dogs and cats, that will eat grass to induce vomiting. Gundry states that exposure to increasingly more and more vegetables amounts to ""mini doses of chemo"" that protect us rather than harm us. Gundry's diet is similar to this therapy in that is advocates eliminating breads and eating mostly vegetables (but not needing to juice them in any way). In his book, he cites numerous patients who were also able to get off of their medications (statins, insulin, etc). Gundry's book was very informative and at no point did I feel I was being handed speculation or guesswork or being talked down to and told what to do ""because Gerson said so."" If just looking for health and well being, I recommend his book instead. He talks about the anti-cancer properties of berries and how nuts such as almonds and walnuts are very healthy for their anti-inflammatory properties.I don't doubt that this Gerson therapy works, but unless you are wealthy enough to afford 15-20 pounds of all-organic produce per day (yes, per day) and can arrange with a vegetable distributor to have vegetables available to you all year round, then this book is definitely inaccessible to you. Remember too this book requires working closely with a physician who can interpret lab results, unless you feel that, as the book says, you can interpret them for yourself using the section given for that purpose. (I have no medical background, and it all looked very foreign.) Even if you could, this therapy Gerson is selling requires adjusting of the supplements after interpretation of the lab results. If all that sounds too complicated, Charlotte Gerson invites anyone to the clinic in Mexico to stay at a rate of $5,500 per week.This type of diet is clearly beneficial and may save lives, if it can be implemented. But, it is extremely strict, very expensive, and exactly how much of Charlotte's own speculation was thrown in makes it difficult to get to the bare bones of what makes this system work. I certainly would not give equal credit to all its parts; elimination of sodium is probably much more helpful than avoiding tap water, for instance. The book is massive and quite a pain to read, if I can be honest, due to the tone in which it was written. It certainly is not completely natural either, once one realizes the plethora of supplements one is expected to incorporate. Despite her claims of otherwise, I think this system would benefit those who try to use as much of it as possible, whether due to time restraints or financial limitations.UPDATE: From the Gerson website, we find that there are two Gerson treatment clinics - one in Mexico, as mentioned earlier, and another in Hungary. I will speculate that the reason for choosing these locations has to do with the legal consequences of the nature of the claims of this program and the risk of death of the patients involved. Realize that any institution outside of the United States is only bound by the laws of that country. US and other foreign citizens are not protected by the same laws that apply in their home countries.",0,0,0,0

RQJ9DM88W875R,"UPDATE FROM RECENT PURCHASE (1 June 2013):So, I initially bought one of these bulbs in 2012 for my Epson Home Cinema 8500UB, and it was amazing -- great color for a fraction of the price, and I gave it a 5 star rating. The bulb lasted about 1400 hours before it became dimmer and dimmer, and fearing that it was going to go out, I decided to buy two more of them.And something has clearly changed within the last year, because both of these bulbs were made differently. They were difficult to fit in the projector, to the point where -- for each of them -- I had to remove a screw to keep both of them in.And, more disturbingly, the brightness was HORRIBLE out of the box. Worse yet, when an image went from dark to light, you could watch the bulb change -- almost as if it couldn't handle the changes in dynamic brightness. I was really concerned that my projector was broken, but before looking at a repair that was a few hundred dollars, on a lark I decided to order a genuine Epson bulb for $299 from their site.Not only did it fit right in, but the bulb is AMAZINGLY bright than either of the new ones were.

RAINWWKOX1GU2,"So-I was looking for a fantasy/medieval title to read and after seeing the reviews of Eragon I said to myself ""it couldn't be that bad"" or could it? Now given I am only 175 pages into the story and it is possible to become a great read (hey, the Red Sox won four in a row) so anything's possible. But now I will list my personal problems with the book although most of them have already been stated in previous reader reviews.1. Paolini's use of thesaurus driven vocabulary gives me the image of him sitting at his computer, writing the story on Microsoft Word, and hitting the Thesaurus button on the toolbar everytime he needed a neat word to fill in for the boring one he came up with - EX: Pg.9 - He uses 'conflagration' to describe the burst of color from the sun, which irks me as 'conflagration' isn't the best word to use in that sentence and in a fantasy novel the word just doesn't fit well - I think geological science when I hear the word2. The plot. O Lord where to start. Let me just list what he has stolen/borrowed/tweaked from other novels/movies.  1. The name Eragon. The story is about a boy and his dragon  and the best Paolini could do is replace the 'D' in Dragon with an 'E' - brilliant - also sounds a little too close to 'Aragorn' for me  2. He lives with his uncle and cousin in an isolated piece of forest - much like Luke Skywalker lives with his uncle and aunt in an isolated piece of desert  3. Eragon was left with his uncle when he was a child by his mother who disappeared after his birth (his mother's name is Selena by the way - I guess the movie came on VH1 while he was writing the book but anyway) - much like Aragorn from LOTR was left with the Elves and Luke Skywalker was left with his uncle after his mother's death  4. Eragon's uncle is attacked and eventually dies because 'evil characters' are looking for the dragon egg - Luke Skywalker's uncle and aunt are murdered because the Empire is searching for R2 and C3P0  5. The idea that a nothing farmerboy saves the land is no new thing but in Alexander's 'The Tales of Prydain' an assistant pig-keeper named Taran, who lives with an old sage and a mid aged man, is spectacularly close in storyline when compared to the beginning of 'Eragon'.  6. Brom is Obi-Won Kenobi - don't even try to challenge that  7. Brom attempts to teach Eragon magic and in doing so tells him to levitate a stone from his outstretched palm using magic. Hold on let me ah yes - Yoda teaching Luke Skywalker to raise stones in the air and stack them upon one another using The Force AKA another form of magic  8. The Dragon Riders ARE the Jedi and the Empire IS the EVIL EMPIRE and Galbortrix IS Chancellor Palpatine who in turn represents the SITH (think i got the name right) - I feel like I'm reading Star Wars but the blasters and lightsabers are replaced with swords and bows.-Let us remember I am only 1/4 through the book and might remain stuck there for it is painful for me to read a novel that is clearly a ripoff of many beloved stories already told. Now given,  J.R.R. Tolkien did not create the idea of 'One Ring To Rule Them All', it is a Norse/Welsh mythological tale that was first an opera around the 17th century and Tolkien simply refined the story and indeed he did create a massive portion of the saga, but  the center idea that drives the story, the one ring, is not Tolkiens, but Paolini must learn to write without drawing such a great deal of plot and characters from other writers. He was quite young when he began the book and it shows through his immature sense to borrow ideas and I will buy 'Eldest' in order to see if he has grown into his own ideas and own story",0,0,0,0

Second of all the box art gives the whole movie away. being reason I say this is because of the poster art of the movie and the old warner vhs tape shows no sign of what kind of creature is cujo. I know it might not be a big deal to some people but when I first rented this movie, I was so curious about what CUJO was, The box art and original theatrical poster art was so unique that you were guessing what kind of horror is this.

Well I am not a book reader but I was so excited to know what kind of killer was CUJO and was a dog, I kinda had a hunch though. This movie is fantastic.

R26XYWNV18FY21,"I am an experienced professional software engineer of more than 20 years and I bought this book with high hopes to quickly get up to speed with iphone programming and yes I am an absolute beginner in terms of IPhone app development.After about 60 or 70 hours of effort I am about half way through chapter7 (of 9 chapters) and am giving up (this is not of my nature as I am very tenacious)What I have found is the following -  Of the first 9 projects I have completed 6 -  The author who is supposedly a University Lecturer provides either very simple almost trivial examples (even some of these do not work correctly - see below) or examples that are very complex (at least to a newbie like me anyway) with many many lines of code to type in. -  As other reviewers have found the technical review is non existent.  In only 1 project (the very simplest) the code compiles correctly. In all other projects the code in the book does not compile.  In most instances the code in the book does not match the code downloaded from the authors website, and does not match the code in the video examples.  Sometimes even the code in the text does not match the code in the screen shots provided in the book.-  But it does not really matter as none of it compiles.In summary this book is full of errors and inconsistencies and is a very frustrating book to try and follow.There does not seem to have been any update at all - in fact in one of the projects I googled the solution and found it on a notice board with a response from the author saying the person posting it  was a genius for finding the solution - but still the author did not post an update or if he did his code still did not compile!!I have a library of two or three hundred books on application development and understand the difficulties in keeping up with fast moving technology advances.

RP2B2TCAIAJBO,"The following 4-star paragraph, written in January 2012,  has been edited into past tense to reflect both this product's potential and its incredibly short lifespan:This little bitty stapler had a lot going for it: Came with its own little box of 1,000 green-colored staples that fit all standard-size staplers.  Came in two very loud colors so that,  tiny though it was, it would have been easy to find on even the messiest desk. Plus which, it came with a key chain attached.  And attached to the key chain was a belt hook, which I hooked onto my pencil jar, making it easy to find amid clutter.  I'd have much preferred to choose my own color combination from Swingline's pretty good selection; would have gladly paid a buck or two more if given that option, especially since the one they sent me is yellow & orange, which would have been my absolute last choice had I had one. Also, it arrived from the Amazon outside seller just a couple of days after I ordered it.UPDATE 3/2/12:  Quit working after 30 days. Spent two days trying to get it to release a staple. Couldn't do it. So came back here and deducted two of its original four stars. And then discovered I was not alone in all this. Ah, well. You get what you pay for, I guess. And mostly what I got was about 950 green staples that can be used in my not-cute-but-nonetheless-functional stapler.",0,0,0,0

R1LNTVGFO9VMXI,"If you are following along with the NIV you will feel this production is accurate, BUT if you are following along with the King James, you may very well find some distortion from scripture in this film. Keep in mind that the actors are for the most part Hollywood liberals, and that the translation of the NIV was headed up by Dr. Marten Woudstra, a gay man who led the old testament translation and Dr. Virginia Mollenkott, an avowed lesbian, who led the new testament translation. You won't find the word ""sodomite"" anywhere in that BOOK and ""repentance"" has been left out of most scriptures. Homosexuality is not condemned in the NIV as a sin, except in cases of male prostitution or forced sex acts and ""repentance"" is treated as if non-necessary to a Christian life. There are many other things that are different as well from one version to the other. There is a HUGE difference between the King James and the NIV Versions of the Bible and thus I would suggest using extreme caution when viewing anything based on the NIV. If you read the new version I would urge you to research these two people and the origins of the NIV liberal translation of the word of God.If that doesn't bother you then you need not be concerned about it, but if you hold to the text of the King James Bible, it is imperative that you know this film is based on the NIV, NOT THE KING JAMES! The other reviews posted here do not reflect this information and I think it is important for those who adhere to the original meaning of the Bible that this film like many others are modern interpretations and should be viewed as such. I'm not telling you that you shouldn't watch this film. Use your own discretion. It is simply my intent to give a review based on the King James version as almost all the other reviews deal explicitly with the other interpretation. It's only fair that the other side is also shared for those to whom it applies.",0,0,1,1

RBO2QRC5TNJOD,"Eragon by Christopher Paolini was, in my opinion, an artistic failure. To begin with, the plot is as follows, briefed, of course: A boy on the verge of growing into a man discovers something thing will forever change his life: a dragon. (Slight Spoilers) However, when he loses his uncle, our hero vowes to take up revenge. Assisting him is a shady storyteller who knows more than he reveals.Such a plot has been overdone, to put it nicely. Without any orignality, this book simply fails. The prose is not good (lots of telling, incorrect word usage, sentence blunders, uneeded descriptions, overdosed adverbs, and lack of reality). If this were Tolkien, I would have rethought even touching Fantasy ever again.It seems to me that those who read this book and enjoy it are teenagers who haven't tasted Fantasy, or if they have, it's been through video games and movies such as LOTR the movies and/or Final Fantasy. If you are included in that group, then by all means, you might just love this book and admire Mr. Paolini for doing what he did: creating an ""epic"".However, I don't find anything ""epic"". The world is dull and a complete rip from Tolkien, more so than any other Tolkenesque world I've run across. The storyline is straight from Star Wars, no denying it. The plot is linear, making me feel like the ripped-off world is really alive. While Eragon and Brom are off, I feel as if the entire world is just standing still, waiting to be graced by the presence of our hero(s).I'm troubled by the fact a literature teacher found this as excellent. Shakespeare and Homer lost their places in the classroom, perhaps?If you are a fan of fantasy and have been reading for many years, or even if you've just started and enjoy class literature, may I direct you to George Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire, R. S. Bakker's The Prince of Nothing, Steven Erikson's Malazan, the Fallen, Madaline Howard's The Hidden Stars, or (for those who like to be bold) Mervyn Peake's Gormenghast? Those series have brought me great pleasure. I'm sorry, Mr. Paolini, but I'll take either Tyrion, Steerpike, Frodo, Whiskeyjack, or Prince Raun over Eragon, book and character.",0,0,0,0

Normally I would not bother commenting on garbage books I've read, but this trash won a Hugo.  How???The first third of the book, dealing with children, is interesting enough, but the second two thirds devolve into vapid pointless tedium worthwhile of later Jean Auel.

Yet, Still i cant believe why  people say they are soo great. The vocalist sings in a voice that almost  sounds like he's joking about everything he is saying. I myself, rate songs  mostly on how they sound(afterall music IS sound) or if the lyrics are  completely amazing. well.....SOAD's lyrics definitely arent very amazing.  so then that leaves it up to the sound......and again i dont see what  people see in them! the songs lack a sense of togetherness. i mean one  minute he will be singing in a sort of whiney, whimpering voice, then next  he lets out a hardcore growl. However, i will be the first to agree that  many bands can go through this transition and make it sound amazing, but  SOAD is not one of them.  i listen to bands like Soulfly, fear factory,  KoRn, RATM, static-X and others similar to that. (if i listed my other  favorites most of you will probably never had heard of them so i dont see  any point in listing them.)

R4A8IX0Z8V1ES,"This was on HBO, rated three stars, so I thought I'd watch. Who ranks these? Where do I start?First the dialog. Completely unbelievable. None of it sounded real. Zero. I'm also getting really tired of seeing middle-school aged children be the wise soothsayers, making all the adults nod sagely. I was creeped out by the borderline unnerving stalking of the son character of the babysitter, and the similarly creepy (and completely unbelievable) stalking her character did of the father. The single-mindedness the son had about the babysitter was entirely ridiculous. Doesn't the kid own an X-box?? Thirteen year old boys have the attention spans of gnats, and I would be a little weirded out if I was an adult around a kid who was that obsessed. The youngest daughter was a paper-thin throwaway character, mindlessly flitting around the movie, dancing like an autistic mental patient in her dad's new apartment, after her parent's marital separation. Oh, how funny! I'm surprised they didn't put her in an omnipresent tutu to really hammer home just how unaffected and breezy she is about--let me repeat it--her parent's marital separation. Was anyone else skeeved out seeing Steve Carell trying to get his groove on at a lounge catering to twenty-somethings, aka his daughter's age? Maybe this is commonplace in LA, but in the rest of the country, there's something really gross about it as well as tired. Barring the baffling attraction the rest of the country has for Ryan Gosling, as well as the boring one-note Emma Stone (who basically plays the same character over and over and over and over), I guess no other women who frequent the only bar apparently in town had any personality whatsoever. Kevin Bacon was supposed to be a reviled character, but I was like ""thank God, someone interesting"" every time he came onscreen.And then they had to hit us with the cheesiest technique ever, one I refer to as a film's ""Oh Captain my Captain"" moment--at a middle school graduation no less. We're supposed to believe that an audience there to see their own child graduate is going to be in thrall of a rambling speech about love, clapping along? In reality, everyone would be shifting in their seats uncomfortably, hissing that maybe you should shut up so we can get on with it, which is exactly how I felt about 100% of this lame hackneyed piece of a movie.",0,0,0,0

R1W42JYFWU0JNC,"As a father of three daughters, I want my girls to grow up with a strong sense of self-image, and thus, I’ve become interested in YA fiction that tackles this theme. Since I also enjoy contemporary fantasy, I’m intrigued when the genre is used in a creative way to illustrate the theme. That’s what drew me to this book. Just consider this cool premise:Main character Lola has some body image issues. She feels she’s freakishly tall, awkward, fat, and generally unattractive. She’s teased at her summer camp job and bullied at school. Then without warning, she turns temporarily invisible. Now she can evade the bullies or even enact some revenge upon them, all while learning to love herself.Going in, I was expecting that Lola would experience significant personal growth by the end of the story. It wouldn’t be right for a book about self-esteem to not have that. Without considering that a spoiler by any means, I was pleased that Lola is definitely in a better place at the end of the book. However, I was disappointed by many other aspects—including plot and character elements, as well as overall execution—of the story.For a book with such a strong premise—a character who can turn invisible as a metaphor for not being seen for who she truly is—there was a significant lack of invisibility in the story. She spends very little time in her invisible state, and when she did, wasn’t merely invisible, but also intangible. In many other instances of invisibility of fiction, the character can be heard and felt. Not so here, but I’m not bothered by that because that works in the plot. With her friend Charlie’s help, Lola attempts to learn control over her new power, but very little of this was shown.Also, Lola would learn something new about her power and then tell Charlie or Jon—the boy she crushes over and eventually ends up in instalove with—about it in detail. This caused certain passages and descriptions to be repeated and told rather than shown. The reader learns (is told) that Lola isn’t the only character to have had this power, but its origin is never satisfyingly explained. I’m okay with suspending my disbelief that a character can become invisible, even if by magical reasons, but without an explanation, it reads solely as a plot device.But my biggest issue is with Lola as a narrator. For someone who is teased and bullied, she’s awfully judgmental. Throughout the book, we learn her negative opinions about the appearances and attitudes of her family members, and though her relationship with them is strengthened (abruptly) by the end, her initial feelings toward them make her not as likeable as she could be. At the start of the story, Jon hangs with the kids who bully Lola, and she forgives him far too quickly, which undermines her personal growth and doesn’t set a good example for teen girls.I was hoping for a creative and intriguing take on issues of self-esteem, but unfortunately, most of what I expected wasn’t visible in this book. The premise is clever, but I never felt the stakes tangibly built to a satisfying climax and resolution. Along with too much telling instead of showing, Invisible can only see TWO STARS.",0,0,0,0

R1YRP7FHXBF8VO,"It is with deep sadness that I must inform fellow readers--especially those who have been and still are Cornwell fans--that I cannot recommend this book as a ""good read."" I gave it 2 stars because flashes of the Cornwell we all know and respect appear every so often throughout--tight narrative, wonderful characterization, exquisite scene detail, taut dialogue. Cornwell is one of the few writers who can turn crime scenes into macabre poetry, who can resurrect the violently deceased with the turn of a phrase and the punch of a character's ruminations; who can quite honestly humanize the monstrous. Truly gifted as a writer, I cannot condemn the book on its stylistic flow. However, with regard to storyline, I must respectfully ask: where the hell is Kay Scarpetta? What the hell just happened here?Dr. Kay Scarpetta relocates to Florida in the wake of all that happened in ""The Last Precinct."" Demoted, I suppose we could say, she serves now as a ""consultant"" and ""lecturer."" The first third of the book provides a window to Scarpetta's continued grief over losing her job, her Richmond life, and profiler Benton Wesley (presumably dead). But trouble's afoot in the form of the international cartel of the Chandonne family. Jean-Baptiste is on death row in Texas, Jean-Paul, his beautiful twin brother, is murdering women outside Baton Rouge, a city gripped with the serial murders of women (and I'm assuming Ms. Cornwell is basing this storyline on the actual murders that were occurring in BR tracked in the media since 2001 or thereabouts). Scarpetta finds herself intrigued by a Baton Rouge policewoman who attends one of the ""great forensica's"" seminars. Will Scarpetta mentor her? Sadly, that storyline is not developed. Nic Robillard (a refreshing character providing one of the only sparks in this turgid plotline) is trying to crack the BR murders but runs up against old-school Louisiana corruption and politics. But then her history is implausibly tainted by the revelation that her own mother was murdered by Jean-Paul years before; a case that remains unsolved until the end of ""Blow Fly.""Suffice it to say that hijinks ensue. Jean-Baptiste begins sending letters to Scarpetta (he'll tell her all his secrets since he's about to be executed--as long as she administers the lethal cocktail in the death room on his day); he allegedly sends letters to Lucy, who ends up on some absurd sidetrack in Poland where she and her partner Rudy stage the suicide of Jean-Baptiste attorney Rocco Caggliano (Marino's son). Meanwhile, Jean-Paul and henchwoman Bev are continuing to murder women in BR. Why? What are they doing? What's the greater purpose? Readers are left wondering.As if all this wasn't enough in the realm of implausibility, one of Scarpetta's ghosts shows up as the great manipulator behind all these ""coincidences"" that will bring down the Chandonne empire and save Scarpetta from a horrid death at the hands of Jean-Paul or perhaps his brother Jean-Baptiste, who we all know will most likely escape Texas's death row as the predictability of his continued appearances throughout the book leads us to wonder why he's playing such a central role.This reader has been terribly disappointed with Scarpetta's character devolution (development, in this sense, strikes me as perhaps something positive and what's going on with Scarpetta is far from that) since ""Last Precinct."" Actually, since Cornwell opted to involve Scarpetta romantically with Wesley. Rather than maintaining the Scarpetta edge, Cornwell has reduced the doctor to a depressed, ineffective, woefully unprepared shadow of her former self. She plays little role in this book and gets her hands dirty in only one crime scene toward the end of the book. What is it about crime writers who hook their female characters up in somewhat serious relationships with men? The characters invariably lose their edges and spend all their time obsessing about the whereabouts or wherefors of the men in their lives. That's NOT the Scarpetta I came to enjoy reading. Nor is it entirely realistic. If Cornwell wants to involve Scarpetta with a man, fine. But why must Scarpetta lose herself, lose her abilities as a brilliant forensic pathologist and do nothing but pine away for a guy who was cheating on his wife with her? Quite frustrating.Meanwhile, Lucy is off galivanting across eastern Europe, manipulated by the puppeteer I won't reveal here. She struggles with HER ghosts, as well and I ended up not having much respect for her as a character. What happened to her? She's rude, mouthy, impulsive to the point of endangering everyone around her, confused, and angry. She didn't learn that from Scarpetta; where did she learn all these bad behaviors? I couldn't find much redemptive about Lucy this time around--one of the many disappointments in this book. For his part, Marino continues to be caught up in his odd (but believable) longing for Scarpetta and his horrendously unhealthy lifestyle.In short, the first third of the book was the best of this mess. The story is introduced, Scarpetta is talking forensics, Nic Robillard looks like a potentially new and interesting character. Then a series of bizarre yet orchestrated coincidences occur, all linked to the Chandonne cartel (would Ms. Cornwell PLEASE stop it with the Chandonnes? It's as if she's trying to morph into a Robert Ludlum with this international intrigue angle). In the end, readers are left with a story that is barely connected by the loosest of threads (most so implausible as to border on ridiculous), the unfortunate reintroduction of a ghost from Scarpetta's past, a forensic investigator incapacitated by her longing for a once married, presumably dead man, and a series of characters who, like actors trying valiantly to save a sunken script, move woodenly across the once brilliant stage Cornwell created in ""Postmortem.""Alas, Scarpetta. Alas Cornwell. We thought we knew ye.",0,0,0,0

R3F4Q3GEC8ZKLZ,"When the body of Peter “Rabbit” Mullen, is discovered on the shore near the extravagant East Hampton beach house of Barry Neubauer, it is instantly ruled a drowning suicide by the investigating officer, Frank Volpi, and just as quickly swept under the rug. And that’s where it would have stayed if not for the efforts of Peter’s older brother, Jack, a law student working a summer job at a prestigious New York City law firm, and who also happens to be dating Barry Neubauer’s daughter, Dana. Jack smells a rat, and a big one at that, knowing that his brother wasn’t in the frame of mind to kill himself and wouldn’t have gone swimming in the freezing water that night anyway. So Jack and his townie friends do a little digging and uncover the sexual deviancy of the East Hampton summer elite. Which of course does not sit well with the wealthy part time residents of the town, who use their clout to hamper Jack’s investigation into their criminal activity. A professional hitman is hired to scare off Jack’s friends and prosecution witnesses. It works and Jack is left to bring his brother’s killers to justice with the aide of his wily old Irish grandfather, Macklin, and private investigator Pauline Grabowski. In the end, Jack, Pauline, Mack and his fellow townies band together to hold Neubauer and his cronies accountable for their crimes.James Patterson has the fast paced thriller down to a science, if not an art, with short chapters (most no longer than two or three pages) that move the story along. It would have been easy for the authors to sacrifice characterization to the fast clip of the plot, but they managed to create strong, believable and likable characters (except for the villains, of course). The narrative never loses steam, even when it deviates a few times from the main plot.[SPOILER ALERT]I originally was going to give the book a much higher rating, but then I got to the climax of the book when Jack and his friends [kidnap Neubauer and his cohorts and put them on trial in an abandoned, unfinished house, with Macklin presiding as judge. It works for the plot because Neubauer and his cronies have pulled so many legal strings with friends in high places, that Jack really has no other recourse but to go to this extreme measure. It just didn’t feel right to me and completely took me out of the book. The whole thing is sort of a mockery of the justice the characters are seeking, and only sees results because one of them works part time as a reporter for a local tv station and manages to get a news camera and somehow hack into the networks broadcasting signal, so the entire world is witness to the proceedings.Another issue I had with the book is that it is stated that Barry Neubauer, who is infected with HIV was having sex with his daughter (amongst many others including Peter), Dana, who was also having sex with Jack. Yet it never seems to occur to Jack or anyone else, for that matter, including the authors, that he too might possibly be infected and should be worried he either has HIV and could have passed it along to his new girlfriend Pauline. Neubauer having HIV is such an important part to the ending of the book that it is a glaring omission by the authors to completely ignore this possibility.These two things aside, though, it was an interesting thriller and the first book in a long time that kept me turning the pages to find out what would happen next.",0,0,0,0

R1DNLMZQRNFKAV,The quality control on this pen set is terrible. One of the pens came broken. It had little shards missing from it but they were not in the case or packaging at all and the packaging was not damaged either. In fact the box was shrink wrapped and the set did not look used.The packaging looked nice and expensive and the case looked nice at first glance also. There were no loose strings and the stitching looked nice. However almost every pen was stained black on the side that rested against the case. I can just imagine someone putting the case in an expensive purse or bag and the case's black rubbing off.The pens themselves are skinny and cheap feeling. The grips are hard plastic. My first set of gel pens was a Walmart cheap set that was better built than this set. At least the WM set have a rubber/gel grip and feel more substantial. I did not want to use any of the pens knowing I was returning them so I don't know how they preform.I had little doubt I would like these pens with 4.8 out of 5 stars and over 800 people reviewing them. I now know Amazon's review system is very flawed. Buyer beware. I'm thankful for Prime returns!This was an honest review from an average American that purchased this item at full price expecting a decent product based on the number of reviews and its high rating. :(,1,1,0,1
R27B4WZ9VOU2LJ,"I have used these pens for many years and buy new ones as the old ones run out of ink since refills are about the same price. The pen has always been dependable. However, when I decided to buy the pens this time, the pens that came were not the same pen as always. Although it looks very similar, the grip part is about 1/3 of what it used to be, the pen is smaller and feels lighter, the ink fainter and not as smooth, and the buttons are smaller and harder to press down. The only real difference now between this pen and the blue barrel model is the color of the outside.The picture in this review shows the difference between the old pen (the one shown in the amazon picture) and the new model.

R12AJAKM1M5DQ1,"EDIT 11/19/18  I returned the first order for reasons below.  Installed the second batch.  Less than half the ink is used and nothing but problems.  Glad I had a spare black back-up or I would be in real trouble.  The first half of ink life it is pretty good, they go downhill real quick.  I tried the back and forth rocking motion on each cylinder and that did no good.  USE AT YOUR OWN PERIL.EDIT 4/16/2018  I'm downgrading my review.  After using approx 60% of the ink in the black cartridge, I started getting smudging. Black only.  I ran through the Canon cleaning steps, but that did not solve the problem.  There are also some streaks on the left and right side of the printed paper.  I took out the cartridge and found lines etched in the blue roller that are very similar to the streaks.  I will try to contact seller and see if they will replace the bad black cartridgeThe odd thing about this is I had within a couple of hours previous ordered another black cartridge, since the others still have about 80%.  I canceled the order just now and I'm going to see if they will ship me outSo far so good.  The box looked and was labeled a bit differently, but when I looked closely it was properly identified.  Well packed with clear, easy to read instructions.  It was very simple to install and worked right the very first time.  There was no visual difference between what I installed and what I took out, except for the product name label.This is the first set of replacement cartridges I've ordered for this printer.  Have needed black only so far.  For that reason, I'm assigning only 4 stars.

R1BH5J85GVQN3D,"I am only a hundred or so pages into this wretched book, and I really don't know if I have the heart to go on...if I do, then I'll write a part 2 to this review. If I can be bothered.I bought this book thinking that it would be a wonderful, serious, well-written historical novel. Ha! Boy, was I suckered! This isn't a serious book - it's a romance novel, of the Harlequin/Mills and Boon variety (though not even a very good one), trying to masquerade as real literature. But at least romance books usually have the decency to stop at a few hundred pages long, whereas this book goes on for almost seven hundred LENGTHY pages. Ugh! I don't know why the author made it so long-winded. She really shouldn't have. It's painfully full of filler and unnecessary stuff. I myself can sum up the first hundred pages a lot more briefly and effectively:Evil wanton mother: ""Daughter, I am cruel like a stereotypical Disney cartoon villainess, and I say, you must marry Roger.""Spineless, insipidly dull but virtuous daughter: ""Oh goody! I love Roger! I can't wait.""They go to London. Although witless daughter knows that her family have fallen on hard times, she is surprised to find she is forced to live in the kind of dingy little abode you live in when you've fallen on hard times. Still, she doesn't complain, because she's a doormat who never says anything, except about how much she loves Roger, of course. Repeatedly.Handsome and impossibly perfect hero, Roger, enters. He says ""I'll marry her because she looks just like her grandfather.""Silly heroine swoons.Relatives complain about the dowry.And that's pretty much it.I wasn't kidding about the grandpa thing. The hero actually says to the heroine,""God save me, Barbara, but you are the very image of your grandfather!"" And the heroine takes it as the NICEST compliment she's ever received, and proof that Roger is a kind man who likes her. Argh! If some guy told me I looked like my grandpa, I DEFINITELY wouldn't take it as a compliment - I'd assume he was insulting me by telling me I looked like an elderly MAN! That, or I'd worry that he fancied my grandpa.The dialogue in this book is inane. But at least its gaffs are mildly amusing at times, albeit unintentionally. Not so the shallowness, and sometimes extreme nastiness, of the writer in the way she describes her characters. In true romance book style, EVERY character's physical appearance is described in great detail, and their looks assessed and rated, as if how physically beautiful they are - or aren't - is a guide to their worthiness as a person. The hero is of course impossibly good looking, not to mention rich and fashionable and beloved by ALL, and his good looks are mentioned CONSTANTLY, over and over and over again, page after page. It's like being hit with a beautiful sledgehammer. I wanted to yell at the author, ""Okay, I get it, he's handsome, there's no need to keep going on about it. Can you not find something else to say about him? Something INTERESTING perhaps? Some character trait other than just him looking good?"" The hero was so perfect, so utterly flawless in his physical appearance, that I just couldn't believe he was a real human being, so the story around him seemed unrealistic too. The heroine, also, was naturally a physically attractive character (grandpa comments aside), though thankfully her looks were rarely mentioned, unlike the hero's. But apart from those two, the only other attractive character is the mother, and only because it was necessary for her to be, since she was cast in the stereotypical part of the wanton villainess who enjoys seducing men. (Why is it that in so many of these clicheed stories, the heroine is virtuous and good, but the villainess is the kind of woman who'll sleep with a number of men - what a cliche, as if women who sleep around are always bad! So old fashioned!)The pious, virtuous grandmother of the heroine is not mentioned as pretty, but at least she's not much maligned. The author is reasonably kind, for once, but again falls into the trap of seeming to imply that a woman must be virtuous (not to mention God-fearing) to be a good person.The other characters in this book, outside of the four I just mentioned, are described as fat, or old, or ugly, or a combination of the three, and the author absolutely RIDICULES them for their physical imperfections, going on and on and on about it. And naturally, these not-so-pretty characters are always stupid and mean and greedy, because we all know that if you're not beautiful on the outside, you're not beautiful on the inside, right? The overweight maid Clemmie, especially, is ridiculed at every opportunity, her weight constantly made fun of, her looks derided, and the author has written her as a stupid, clumsy character, one that the prettier characters laugh at (seemingly with the author's approval). Many, many parts of the book also deride the elderly characters, talking about their wrinkles, and how silly the characters look and behave and think, and how they shouldn't be dressing in 'younger fashions', and how much fatter and uglier they've become with age.Argh! I was repulsed! It was so mean and shallow and beauty-obsessed, as if only pretty people are worth something.The only halfway interesting minor character was a gay man who's a friend of Roger's. But even he seems like a charicature, a stereotype, flamboyant and gossipy and b*tchy and openly promiscuous, with no real depth or substance or life outside of his role in the hero's life. I thought he seemed more like what people in the eighties who didn't actually know any gay people might think a gay man from San Francisco would be like, based on what they'd seen on tv comedy skits, rather than what a gay man a few centuries ago would actually have been like. I am almost tempted to keep reading the book to see if his character is going to be further developed. But I sense that things aren't going to improve for this character, and may just get worse. He's probably only there to spread some gossip or something.But anyway, back onto the subject of shallowness, I got sick of reading every character's appearance being picked apart, like a corpse by a vulture. It was like reading one of those cruel celebrity gossip magazines that are full of articles about which star has put on, or lost, a few pounds, and in which all the celebrities are constantly scrutinised for every little flaw in their appearances. If you like those kinds of magazines, or if you're the type of person who likes to criticise the way that people around you look (presumably because you look so perfect yourself) then you'll probably like this book. It'll probably help if you're also the kind of person who loves romance books and those really trashy, barely-believeable soap operas that are screened during the day on tv. However, if you're a lover of intelligent, witty, well-written or truly entertaining literature, and if you're not totally hung up on personal appearances, and bad cliches make you cringe, perhaps you might do better to bypass this book and look for a better one. Also, I don't think guys are going to like this book. But hey, I may be wrong. Guys can be really unpredictable. And that's the way I like them. I like that guys are interesting and mysterious and individual, with more to them than just IMPOSSIBLY PERFECT LOOKS!",0,0,0,0

R2TYTT6Q86RNYV,"Prey offers a ton of great gameplay, Great Tech, Stunning Production Value, and is something I would definitely consider ""Next Generation"".Prey also offers some great twists. Setting wise I found the overall theme Gross for the sake of being Gross, lacking depth, or reason. This is usually something I can get over pretty fast and still enjoy the game for what it is. In the case of Prey, that was even easier than most, due to interesting Gravity Puzzles, Portal Tech, interesting alien weapons, and a lot of very fresh new ideas for FPSs.** SPOILER ALERT **The reason I gave this Prey only 2 Stars is because of a some situations that I felt were crossing the moral line for me personally.There was a part where you witness 2 children captives (one little boy and a little girl about age 5-6) are brutally and graphically killed. I consider this very bad taste, and usually shrug it off as sensationalism, and go on with the game. However there is another point where the murdered children become Spirits, and to get past them you have to Shoot them (It takes less ammo to shoot them in the head).Seeing scenes of children brutally murdered by an Evil Force is crossing the line for me, but it is a Line I can step back across with a little effort. Evil things do evil things to everyone, including children. That's what makes them evil, and can drive a story or make something villainous even more sinister.However, having to personally shoot the children sprits myself (Preferably in the head) was just way too much for me personally. This was the point I stopped playing myself, so my review is only up to this point in the game. I have no idea what comes next.I am not one to usually jump on the ""Keep Violence out of my Video Games"" bandwagon, but in the case of Prey I feel they went to a place that just felt was very wrong and I had a very big problem with being in a situation where I had to Shoot children or children like monsters (Spirits or other wise). For me that earned a very large Star reduction for what otherwise could have been a five star game for me.I know that some people don't feel that something like this is a big deal, and that there are other people who feel much like I do on this topic. It is for the latter people I am writing this review.** END SPOILER ALERT **Don't get me wrong, Prey has some amazing parts as well, stunning situations, and some challenging puzzles. There is a Lot I do really like about Prey, but it is not a game for everyone. I feel it may not me for me.If this is your type of game, The Limited DVD Edition is worth the extra $10-15.

R2W2633RL1KEWW,"Pro901 has impressive specifications on paper. The main reason to buy Pro901 was inexpensive black ink because paying $20~30 per ink cartridge seem unreasonable to me.Pro901 had worked well until I stopped using it for a while. As some reviewers had the issue of clogged printhead, I've had the same print quality issue. In order to resolve the issue, I had to run printhead cleaning several times and clean dried ink off from the metal pieces that contact cartridge. For an occasional printer user, this issue is unacceptable.About the design, it definitely looks better in picture than in person. Touch panel looks fancy. One main design flow is the paper support in which printed papers rest. My old Canon printer lowered paper support automatically, but for Pro901 I need to pull out the paper support manually. If I don't fully extend the paper support, the printed paper will be wrinkled since Pro901 eject paper out pretty hard.Yet, I enjoy low cost of black ink and wireless feature. However, knowing there are better printers, I wouldn't recommend Pro901 to my friend.Update>> If color ink is low, Pro901 won't print in black only mode either; removing cartridge won't do a trick. I've read that Pro901 uses a little bit of color ink even for black only printer. Since I use this printer once in a week, I need to run cleaning printhead, which drains color ink, every time to remove clog. This fact negates the benefit of low cost black ink.

RQEJ3R6B47B88,"A lot of features for the money.  Very easy setup.  Cheap black ink.  The downside is very slow warm up to start printing.  I would go with another printer(faster)if you only print a few pages at a time.This is an update to my original review.  Have had occasional problems with colored stripes and streaks on my black and white printing.  Then this week the printer produced blank pages.  I have only had this printer 8 months and have probably printed less than 200 pages during this time.  After a long session with tech service to update my firmware, they concluded that I had a faulty printer head.  The customer support was very good although I did have some difficulty understanding the rep.  I received new print head and color cartridges the next day(impressive) and now everything works again.  I just hope this settles all my problems.This an update to my update.  Printer quit printing.....all I got was blank pages.  Replaced the black ink cartridge with new one even though the indicator showed 25% ink remaining.  It will now print but the quality is really poor.

R3J8FAUNU910LA,"I'm not really happy with this password book. It's the binding, you can't easily flip pages without having to fiddle with the pages bindings alignment. You try to close it and the binding is stuck, you gotta adjust it. That's my major issue with this. The next is that there isnt tabs for each individual letter, there are 2 letters on a tab. Like A-B is one tab. The only reason I'm even giving 2 stars is because the materials and printing is good, the binding method is terrible which makes it unusable for me. The binding is ""Wire-O"" binding. It would be better if it was just a continuous spiral coil bound. I will just go back to using a ""telephone and address book"" and deal with its issues of using it as a password book.",0,0,0,0
R3QBMVQSXPLKRT,"Originally posted at Fantasy Literature.Meg Corbyn has escaped from the man who’s been using her prophetic abilities for his own profit. Meg has never been in the outside world — she’s been institutionalized since she was a child — and she has no idea how to take care of herself. The only place where she might successfully hide from her owner is in the Courtyard of the Others, a race of dangerous shapeshifters who are much more animal than human. Meg applies for the Others’ job opening as a liaison to the humans. She has no skills, but she’s determined to prove herself worthy.Though he has very little experience with humans, Meg’s new boss Simon Wolfgard (a wolf who transforms into a human, even though he hates being in that body) realizes there’s something different about Meg. She seems so innocent and naïve. When he and the rest of the Others discover that Meg is being hunted, they reverse their previous policy of not interfering in human affairs so they can protect her.I didn’t read the publisher’s blurb for Written in Red before reading the book and that’s the only reason I can give it as much as 2.5 stars. The only interesting part of the story for me was the mystery of who Meg is and why she’s so valuable. Unfortunately, all of this is given away in the blurb. Other than this mystery, most of the plot focuses on Meg learning to live outside the institution that’s been her home for as long as she can remember.Her “liaison” job is not what you’d think. Basically she’s a mailroom clerk. She accepts packages that human deliverymen bring to the Courtyard for the Others. Some of this is sweet and entertaining, such as when she makes friends with ponies (who are really elemental spirits) and gets them to deliver packages for her, but most of it is just plain boring. She gets a notebook and records the deliveries. She sorts the mail. She cleans the office. Outside of work, she’s figuring out how to do laundry and use the microwave. Most of the plot involves Meg learning and performing these mundane tasks. It’s sweet, but dull. The liaison job should have been a lot more interesting.The aspects of Meg’s personality that make her an unusual protagonist were, unfortunately, the things I didn’t like about her. Her simple-mindedness and naïveté make her a dullard. She is probably the dullest protagonist I’ve ever met in a book. Her addiction to cutting herself, which is related to her prophetic abilities, was, for me, extremely unpleasant. I’m sure that many readers will love Meg’s sweetness and sympathize with her, but I just didn’t like anything about her. Anything. I also didn’t like Simon Wolfgard, the wolf-human shapeshifter who is obviously being set up as Meg’s love interest for future books in the series. I can tell he’s going to be one of those growling aggressive males who have to protect and boss around the dumb weak woman. He keeps snarling and calling her a “stupid female.” I hate that.There were a couple of characters I did like, though, most notably a cop who’s new in town and takes an interest in Meg’s welfare and is concerned about tensions between humans and the Others. These tensions rise as the story goes on and it’s seems like war may be imminent. A lot of the tension involves the Others’ desire to protect Meg. For such aggressive animals/people (they are constantly calling humans “meat” and threatening to eat them), it’s not really clear why they think Meg’s so awesome and worthy to fight for. All she does is deliver mail.I had a hard time believing in Anne Bishop’s world. In this alternate United States, which looks much different than ours, the Others have always been dominant. Because humans make cool inventions, the Others allow them to live in and rule most of the country while the Others are relegated to special “Courtyards” where human law does not apply. Power is evened out a bit because the Others shun human weapons, so the Others can be killed by guns or bombs. The relationship between Others and humans doesn’t ring true. The Others say they view humans as “monkeys” and “meat,” but they don’t eat them all because they like the inventions they make. They shun or are uninformed about much of human technology while using other inventions. What they shun or use seems arbitrary. Also, I’m still wondering why the Others, who prefer their wild animal lifestyles, even bother to spend time in the human bodies they hate. And why do they need a human mail clerk? Ostensibly it’s because the deliverymen are afraid of the Others, yet there are several Others in the story who could have taken over this job. They don’t do anything else all day.Finally at the very end of Written in Red, stuff starts happening. This is too little too late, but it bodes well for future installments and, since Penguin Audio has already sent me book two, Murder of Crows, I’ll give it a try. The audio version is 18.5 hours long. Alexandra Harris does pretty well with the narration. I’m not crazy about her voice for Simon, and her voice and intonation for Meg really brings out Meg’s naiveté (which was an issue for me), but this didn’t interfere with the story.One final thing: Written in Red gets very high marks (4.5 stars) at Amazon, Audible and Goodreads. I’m baffled about that, but it does indicate that your experience may differ. If you decide to read it, please let me know what you think.",0,0,0,0

It's not particularly long, so I made it all the way through, only to be really disappointed with the totally anticlimactic end to the altercation.

Well Deja F'in Vue. I mean sure they added a couple of pages of new material at the end to marginally advance the story.  But Book three is basicly books one and two condensed and then rewritten from a third character's perspective.  Don't get me wrong this book is excelently written and edited.

R2440MF8AQP9EF,"Wow, what an amazing movie. This wasn't just your regular movie. It was an *Important* movie, because it teaches you things. Mostly things that you probably never knew.For instance, from watching this movie I learned that Racism is BAD. I know, right? Who would have thought? But yeah, it was cool to realize that.Another thing I learned is that everyone in the world is secretly a racist bigot. Seriously, all of us are total jerks when it comes to anyone not the same race as us. If you think you're not, then you just haven't realized it yet. You just wait. Sooner or later, something will happen that will prove what a complete bigot you are. You're probably a homophobe and vegetarian hater too - you just don't know it yet! This movie knows way more about human nature than you do. Don't question its incredible insight into human nature. Just accept that this is the way we all are. We all hate each other. Stop saying you don't hate others and just roll with it, because this movie knows best.The other thing I learned, which kind of goes with the second thing, is that since all other people are racist jerks, they are not to be trusted. Remember that Chinese guy you ran over the other day? (Yeah, happens a lot, I know.) Don't feel too sorry for him, because he was probably involved in human trafficking or some other such business. And that lady whose car got stolen? Don't worry about her - after all, she's mean to her maid. Kinda had it coming, really.Speaking of which, I thought Sandra Bullock's acting skill in this movie was really impressive. I wouldn't have thought it possible for her to maintain the same angry, unlikeable face over the course of the entire movie. But she pulled it off flawlessly. She kind of reminded me of the wife from Everybody Loves Raymond, minus any jokes.Also, Counselor Troi was in this movie. She looked kinda hot in a head scarf, just sayin'.It was cool to see Ludacris in this movie. At one point, his character launched into a monologue about the evils of rap music. I know... IRONY, am I right? (But he never did rap at all, so I've gotta knock 4 stars off my rating for this movie for that alone. If he had busted a rhyme in Sandra's face I woulda been totally on board with that, yo!)Also, this movie featured a car crash. Hence the title, ""Crash"".My only hope is that this movie will make a real difference in society. Such to the point that one day, all people in America will have equal rights. That all minorities will be able to vote. And that mixed marriages will be 100% legal. Yeah, yeah... I know that's a long way off but we can all dream, right?",0,0,0,0

R2G4IGRD8WY0YQ,"This printers software is terrible. I have had to talk to HP support five times and over four hours because the wireless wizard is for naught when printed to put in the password, I’m told the security protocol is wrong, which is false. Two different techs have had to remotely take control and override the software and perform commands (which might as well be a foreign language toMe) to connect with my network. We are very busy business owners and didn’t open pkg until after 30 days. I read all the reviews but don’t remember reading about this problem. For all intent the machine is useless to me. I tried downloading from the website and downloading took forever until I tried Chrome instead of safari. Wizard via CD wasn’t successful either. Called support (read above) and wizard didn’t work for support representatives either. So another program was downloaded and after 11/2 hours connected. Next day, printer not connected to WiFi. Called support went thru process again. This morning same story and I don’t have another 90 minutes to go thru this process again.  I cannot call HP every time I want to print. I just wished I opened package sooner and I would have returned it. But maybe another Samsung printer would do same thing(?). Thoroughly disgusted. I’m no sure where the problem is -within the software, what else could it be? I’m so frustrated that I could sit firm and cry. HP support has been very nice but I’ve list over 10 hours just trying to get the wireless working properly. This morning trying on my own, spent over an hour and nothing. Very very unhappy and at a loss. The blue notes in the picture are instructions to set up going thru back door but even if I can figure out how to do this, I cannot afford the time to do this EVERY DAY. Maybe because my computer is a Mac???????Update:9.7.18. I have spent 5/12 hrs on the phone with HP support. And 9 phone calls. I like the printer but it just will not hold the IP configuration & goes offline. It still does will not connect using the wireless wizard. Each time a rep has configured the printer from the web access but the computer loses the up for no apparent reason. Two days ago. We thought it was fixed, permanently, but when I printed from the mobile app, the printer was out of paper and the printer was disconnected AGAIN. 11/2 hours on phone, again! I believe the printer is faulty but my fault, we are extremely busy, and I didn’t open it until after 30 days. The reviews were good so I trusted that the printer would not be defective. Now I have to return the printer to factory for analysis. Originally. HP said they would send a repair to my house. So I’ll be without a printer for ???? They are sending by email the return label, with a tracking number but they wanted be to call UPS and I said no because been there, done that, a complete hassle so we will see what happens.

R3IODF2BIRQ30H,"Somewhere in Ridley Scott's grandly engineered epic, hammered on and tinkered with by a horde of writers and rewriters, is a flesh-and-blood story that gets lost in all the bread and circuses.Crowe plays Maximus, the most-trusted general serving the aging Caesar Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), leading troops into battle against Germania in 180 A.D. But Marcus Aurelius wants Maximus to fight a tougher opponent -- the corruption of Rome -- by taking power after the emperor's death and restoring the republic. Maximus is reluctant, preferring to return to his wife and son, but he agrees to serve his Caesar. But his Caesar doesn't last too long, thanks to Marcus Aurelius' snotty son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), who kills Daddy and takes the throne - and orders Maximus and his family executed. Maximus escapes, only to be captured by slave traders who train him as a gladiator. Maximus gets a chance at revenge on Commodus when his owner/promoter, Don King, er, Proximo (Oliver Reed), gets Maximus the big gig at the original Caesar's Palace - the Colosseum. Maximus is a hit with the crowd, setting him against Commodus in a battle for the hearts and minds of Rome.Gladiator is pretty to watch but doesn't have enough plot to be a Roman epic (and what plot it has is pinched from Stanley Kubrick's Spartacus), and too much plot to be an action movie (even with the 2-1/2 hour running time). A few things get muddled in the course of things, like the relationship between Commodus' sister Lucilla (Connie Nielsen) and Maximus (or, Lucilla's relationship with Commodus), and some intrigue with the Senate (led by Derek Jacobi, who knows his way around a toga after starring in ""I, Claudius""). Also, there is the distraction of Phoenix, who plays Roman villainy like a very weak John Malkovich.As far as the DVD itself goes - It's awesome - Better than the movie itself. Presented in an anamorphic 2.35:1 transfer, the visual presentation found on the Gladiator: Signature Collection is an almost flawless recreation of the film as I saw it theatrically. The jerky visuals of the war sequences come across as faithfully as the polished exteriors in Rome. The varying degrees of color saturation are rendered amazingly well, from the drab, washed out exteriors in Germania to the earthy tones of Zucchabar, and the vibrant cityscape of Rome. The print is almost completely free from any debris or other imperfections, and appears to have suffered only very slight edge enhancement in a few scenes, making for a wonderfully clean, sometimes polished, but always film-like image. The DVD includes a full-length audio commentary by Director Ridley Scott, Editor Peitro Scalia, and Director of Photography John Matieson. This is a great commentary track that appeals to the more technically oriented film fan. The topics range from Scott's views on historical accuracy, to motivating the actors, to the challenges of making a film of this nature, and more.There is also a section aptly titled From the Cutting Room Floor. Included here are 11 deleted scenes, playable with or without commentary by Director Ridley Scott, that range from 30 seconds to 4 minutes. The 2.35:1 non-anamorphic scenes look quite nice, but have obviously not been through the same postproduction processing as the main feature. In addition to the deleted scenes, there is a 7-minute montage of deleted snippets of footage that is accompanied by the music of Hans Zimmer...this is, for all intents and purposes, a music video. The Making of Gladiator is a 25-minute feature that is pretty much the typical ""cable television promotional making of"" that we've all come to know and love. The use of Zimmer's music throughout this featurette lends a certain charm to the piece that some similar programs lack...and if nothing else, the antics and charisma of Russell Crowe make this one worth watching even if such material isn't normally to your liking. A nice, and somewhat surprising inclusion is the 50-minute TLC program Gladiator Games: Roman Blood Sport - Very informative. Along with other very cool extras, this DVD is simply a must purchase.",0,0,0,0

There are little pockets that look like you should put part of the frame in, but they don’t stay on the frame.  The main issue though, is the fact that it’s impossible to put the big screws through the holes of the canopy fabric when you attach the canopy to the swing.  It’s at least 4 inches too short to fit.  I contacted customer service about a return and they keep telling me I won’t get my refund if the cover is not in usable condition.  Unfortunately, since this is so poorly made and doesn’t fit, one of the holes ripped a little while we were trying to fit it on the frame so I am reluctant to actually pay to ship this piece of crap back unless they guarantee me a refund of my purchase price.",0,0,0,0

It will pay-off by itself after catching 3 fake bills of $100. A business owner will immediately see the benefits outweighing  the costs. The plus side about this is that you can carry it to wherever your customer is and authenticate the bills without having the customer taking his/her eyes off the money.

R1R7TZ38DU2KIK,"To start out, I'm as planner addict, and have used planners for years once I was introduced to them in the Navy. I've always used Erin Condren and (my BIG ideas) Happy Planners and have LOVED them. I was tired of spending the money on the bug name brands, so I gave this Law of Attraction a try and am pretty disappointed, in all honest. This ""planner"" is half made up of self-help mantras and the other half is a poorly executed planner. After you wade through 20ish pages of this ""self help and self growth"" charts/quizes/whatever, you finally get to start your planner...the month layout starts on a Monday, which I wasnt used to with standard planners, so it's been a bit of a battle trying to remember that when filling out. Also, the days are broken down into lines of ""hours"" instead of a larger box so that you arent cemented with documenting everything you do at every hour.If you are looking for some kind of self help and self growth oddly thrown together planner, then this is for you.If you are ACTUALLY looking for a planner to keep track of things/remjnders/events etc, this is totally not for you.Star for being cute and stylish but the cover with the odd mantras feels childish.",0,0,0,0
R236B2HCCBQ70A,"Perhaps the Optima we got is defective, though I can find nothing physically wrong with it (or the packaging). Even with the Swingline 40 staples which are supposed to staple as many as 40 pages, the best we could do was 26 pages, and the points do not bend over to make a smooth underside. In other words, you can get stuck on the points of the staples.When stapling two or three sheets, it's hit or miss. Sometimes, it performs adequately. At other times, one end of the staple is crumpled.Last, even for 25 pages, it takes some effort to get the staples to go through.I've been using Swingline products for decades, and I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and say that this one is a dud. It's going back, but I will not replace it with the same model.(Why two stars? Simply, reviews with one star are usually dismissed and not read because the reviewer is seen as disgruntled and without objectivity. So, two stars just to get you to read this.

R1XOJBRFNZK8WF,"After reading this book, I read reviews of The Te of Piglet and saw how horrid they were.  Then I reread this book.  I read a book like this, read it again and highlight good passages, then read it at least once again with red underlining of the truly meaningful passages.  In rereading this book, the author clearly has veered away from The Hundred Acre Wood.  I found myself very dissatisfied with the few meaningful passages that actually related to it's title and how many empty jars of poo one had to read through and around to find them.  It read this time more like he was just warming up for the bash-fest of the Te of Piglet.  If one is objective and Taoist-learning/leaning, one can't help but question the tone of many passages if the author is truly trying to point toward Tao.  Objectively speaking...Puritans are referred to as ""Miserable,"" ""hardheaded followers,"" and ""Party-Crashing BusyBody religion"" fail(ed)ures.  There rants against automobile pollution/poisons. He draws a line ""...from the Miserable Puritan came the Restless Pioneer, and from him, the Lonely Cowboy, always riding off into the sunset, looking for something down the trail""...to his ""Bisy Backson.""  The more I consider this book, the less I like it.  Though not a Puritan, I've done some personal pioneering and been a true cowboy, sometimes alone but NEVER lonely.  The author is clearly struggling with his own inner/outer issues.  By the end of the book, I found myself having to check the cover again for the title to see how what I'd just read might be related to it.  He truly could have put his few mentionable thoughts easily on the space of the dust cover.  I feel like I need to read Winnie The Pooh, proper, to restore my balance after having my memory of having it read to me in childhood now rendered cloudy.  I think if Pooh were truly present during the writing of this, as the author sometimes pretends, he would have wandered off in search of something interesting instead of waiting to see how this book turned out.",0,0,0,0

The story is based on how a crafty friend spoils the relationship between the two lovers. I wasn't convinced that tiny bits of lies spread by other people can make lovers hate each other. The  camera picks up some nice spots in Chicago, my beloved city. 'The Drake Hotel' reminded my stay there. The wind of the windy city, the familiar skyscrapers, the snow and fogging breaths of the people. All shown very nicely.The music score is good.But the story and the flashbacks confused me.

R1WHRUYDESNKNB,"Update:  Returning this pad.  Another day and I can't stand the smell any longer.  My recommendation -- DO NOT BUY!Original review:  The JETech Mouse Mat with Gel Wrist Pad will eventually do what I want it to do -- keep my wrist from getting sore during a long day at the computer.  I have a Belkin wrist rest just below the keyboard for the same reason.  Comparing the two is interesting.  The JETech wrist support is firmer than the Belkin.  I haven't determined if its good or bad yet, just different.  The Mat with Pad helped helped my wrist already, after a few days of using it.  Assuming it lasts it will overall be a good buy, as its a lower cost than the alternatives.The one negative -- it stinks!  It has a strong chemical or mold smell to it.  Kind of the same as the smell a mop that's been sitting in a janitor's push bucket for days smells like, though a bit more chemical.

R1JTDCHVE0LB9M,"Review after 9 months:- Constant print alignment problems- Smearing- Skipped lines- Heavy color ink usage even though I almost never print color or pictures- Black ink runs out fast even though I use the faded-grey draft mode for more than half my printsThe quality problems are so persistent and grievous that I can't imagine using this for business.  I use it primarily to print worksheets for my two kids, and UPS return labels.  Every time I try to use it for something where quality matters, it disappoints.If this was truly low-initial-cost printer (40 dollar job), then I would accept getting what I paid for.  While this is still an inexpensive printer, the ink costs add up quickly and I will have to consider dumping this since it cannot print anything decently and is too costly to print casually.Note: The printer will not print black if I select black-only if even one color cartridge is reported empty.  I'm disappointed that the Epson is deliberately set up to stop printing black just because a color cartridge is out and did not allow a workaround to print black only. Shame.I've found the scanner produces poor image quality.  I would like to scan my children's artwork on paper, but I get better results taking a picture of it with a camera.  I suppose the scanner function works adequately if you're just using it to replace fax.Printing can be good quality if the right ""inkjet"" paper is used so it doesn't bleed too much.  I think this is the first inkjet I've had where I won't regret having it instead of a laser printer, but I also wouldn't replace the lasers at the office with anything like this.  It's definitely a home, personal or small office, low-productivity printer, and it has limited page sizes.  Personally, the thing I miss the most is double-sided 11x17, but admittedly that is another category/price-range.I have done some photo prints on this, which I would not plan to do regularly.  This is not a photo printer.  I used photo paper to print some proof-of-concepts for an offset print project.  The print quality was quite good, but the printer left roller marks with many tiny pin prick dents on the paper.  There may be an adjustment for this, but it's not worth it to me to figure out.  It was awkward enough just changing paper sizes and orientation with the poor user interface.  For photo printing, I still prefer a laser-exposure mini-lab type system (Fuji Frontier etc.) - In other words, I send it out to a service.I frequently have alignment problems with the printer.  I get places on the page where the image is shifted left or right.  I've run the print head alignment utility several times but it still has alignment problems on occasion.",0,0,0,0

R3FVSE6DJ3BFBI,"I saw this movie first on the big screen I was pretty keen, soI guess I had very high expectations, Imagine how disappointed I wasto discover that this film was far from being the great movie I had desperately hoped it would be, the only other films to get my hopes so disappointingly high was BLAIR WITCH and ABSOLUTE BEGINNERS, although the Matrix is nowhere near as bad/rotten/stupid/or as pathetic as those movies are, (theyre in a class of their own).Their were a few good points that drew me to the movie, like the Special FX and the action scenes, the opening with Carrie Anne Moss and Hugo Weaving was simply brilliant, even though it looked very similar to certain scenes in BLADE actually quite alot of the action scenes seemed to be inspired by BLADE and THE CROW (I wonder why that is? If youve seen BLADE then you will know what I mean! ) Laurence Fishburne is always watchable though his scifi choices havent always been good, do you remember EVENT HORIZON?  I think his talent was wasted or perhaps he could have had a better co-star, not Keanu!Anyway because I liked some of it I decided to give the Matrix another chance, I got it out again on DVD, which is chock full of Extras that are pretty cool, I watched how the actors prepared for their more grueling scenes and began to appreciate the movie on a different level, getting more insight into how hard everyone worked to get this movie up on the big screen I guess it made me more sympathetic, even though I still cringe at Keanus performance, and roll my eyes at some corny scenes with Carrie saying lovey dovey words of encouragement to Neo, I have to say I disliked it less than when I watched it the first time, which is something I guess.I wont discourage anyone from watching it, go see it and find out for yourself make up your own mind, as for me Id rather buy BLADE much more entertaining. By the way did you know that the DVD version has some hidden extras (or 'Easter Eggs as theyre more commonly known, although technically this isnt a real 'Easter Egg') theyre not obviously advertised on the package see if you can find them!",0,0,0,0

I have never had a good color print of anything even though I follow their instructions on how to avoid lines in the prints, etc. The machine has been screaming about the drums were going to need changing so I spend $160 and ordered the drums and changed them and now I can't update the settings.

I develop and printing documents that are used in marketing and distributed to CEOs across the state and government officials.

RIOPCO364TK99,"As the third in the Harper Hall series that has exclusively followed the character of Menolly, I began reading this with the expectation it would be about how the more mature Jouneywoman Harper Menolly changes her society into a less stupid and less sexist Pern.Instead I get a book about that funny one dimensional scamp Piemur from Dragonsinger.  As a plus, by the end of this book he is no longer one dimensional, and I understand his character.  Or I think I do... because if I did, I'd know why he makes those choices in the end of the novel.  Those choices directly opposed to his precious dreams and wild ambitions throughout the entire novel of Dragondrums.So yeah, this book disappointed on multiple levels.  This book is a decent adventure story of Pern with firelizards, but I wanted more than that.  If you don't have my expectations, add more stars.  Dragondrums is not relevant to the other books in this 'trilogy,' and the amount of loose ends (especially about Menolly) left at the end of novel are huge.",0,0,0,0

You would be better off tracing a cat photo or a cat silhouette from the internet.  There are also zero instructions on how to draw the designs inside the cat outline.

RL9F61R2JSCIN,"American and Hollywood themes heavily injected, spoiling  the authenticity of the real story. Themes Such as: Hatred of Russia, display of excessive, confrontational and arrogant personality, and romanticizing Jews.I've read the Book [a serious scholarly work] “Defiance” by Prof Nechama Teck upon which the film is supposedly made, The film and the book do not correspond, many scenes in the film are hugely Hollywood invented, as well as including  American Hollywood themes such as:Hatred or negativity towards Russia: The Russian partisans depicted in the film are generally portrayed as bad, antisemitic characters. In reality  the picture was much more complex. The extensive  interactions of the Bielskis with other Soviet partisans in the area was very complex, involving  negative and positive sides as well. Danger from them as well as comradeship and assistance. It is a typical Hollywood lie that Russian partisan commander refused to inform the Bielskies of the “big hunt”, in reality they were very well informed.  One particularly disturbing  scene is where Tuvia sneaks into a ghetto and having an audience with ghetto inmates and its elders, trying to convince them to run away with him into the forest, Tuvia reassures them with: “We have made an alliance with the Russian partisans”. The leader of the ghetto dismissively responds with “They are as bad as the Germans, you are too young to know the pogroms!”. Nothing like that comes in the book by Teck [the real story], there was no such an exchange. I cant believe that any Jew in German occupied eastern Europe would have said something like that. If the Jews at that time had any hope on someone to come and save them, that one could only be the Soviets/Russia which indeed came in the end and saved whatether left, as well as probably saving much of the entire Slavic race from extermination in German hands. The western allies had no interest in stopping the Holocaust and they betrayed Poland and Czechoslovakia. The death camps were liberated by the Red Army who put a stop to the Holocaust. [By the way, I'm not a communist, but you cant deny history, it is a high time that both Jews and Poles come to acknowledge that the Soviets saved them from extinction]Display of excessive, confrontational and arrogant personality: In the film, a rivalry is depicted between the two brothers, Zus and Tuvia , that even comes to fists and blows. Zus is shown as an  American Macho-man openly defying Tuvia with Arguments and “his” way. Again, in the book, nothing like that appears, no problem between the brothers. There were other serious internal problems in the Otriad, they were usually solved in military fashion, orders and court-marshals, even two executions.Romanticizing of Jews: In the film, a central character is shown beside the 3 brothers, his name is Shimon. One is assumed that he is a Rabbi or other Jewish spiritual teacher, an orthodox Jew. No such a  figure is shown in the book, no such a Jewish spiritual central figure was there.one scene shows a traditional Jewish wedding, the Rabbi officiating is the above Shimon. The wedding is even  complete with Klezmer music, a very nice and romantic scene. but again, in reality there were no such weddings there in the forests. Infact [according to the book by Teck], liberal and casual sex were the common practice there.The only reason I give the film two stars is the positive side of the film- the excellent acting by Daniel Craig who gives some of the idea and flavour of the magnitude of the personality of Tuvia [who is the central focus of the book by Teck].",0,0,0,0

However, he still has the present of mind to feel Stephanie up? What the heck is that? I like Ranger in books 1-7, but not so much after that. I think JE is forcing me to have a preference for him over Morelli.With books 1-7, Morelli was written as a sexy, hot-tempered Italian cop. Now, he is so mellow, I don't know what happened to him. JE is not keeping him consistent. If it was the old Morelli, he would have told Stephanie (and Ranger) to take a hike together. Which self-respecting man would be okay with his gf sleeping with another man?At the beginning of the series, I liked Stephanie but now she needs to grow up. The series started when she was 30 years old. If JE doesn't age her characters, Stephanie has to be at least 35 by now. Can't play the airhead bimbo forever!Finally, she told Morelli that she loved him. However, she also told herself that she loved Ranger in the next second. It took the sincerity of her feelings away. I am so fed up with her.Ohh.. someone has mentioned that Morelli molested her when she was 6 by playing ""choo choo"" with her. He is just 2 years older, which made him 8 years old at the time.

R2UJMLXHF055QF,"I don't mean to add salt to the wounds (if you don't know which wounds I am referring to, continue searching through these reviews) but this book is a sad representation of literature.  Many argue that if a book can get kids to read than it can't be bad, but the truth of the matter is books like this should result in legal action rather than video game licensing and movie deals.I struggled to find a single original idea in this entire work, that's right there is not even one.  What's worse is the presentation of the stolen ideas doesn't come close to the quality of the originals from which it steals.I agree with what others have said in that the biggest tragedy is that there are dozens of authors out there who have struggled to come up with original fantasy novels that have gone unnoticed by the masses.  This is a sad exercise in the power of money when it comes to promotion.  Let's face it, anyone with even a rudimentary grasp of the English language coupled with a near limitless parental budget and a head full of borrowed ideas should be able to duplicate this novel's efforts.Finally to everyone who insists that all fantasy is a rehash of prior concepts, I say simply this: Put down Eragon and read more fantasy. There are original works out there; if not entirely original races and settings, there are more original plots, less stereotypical characters, fewer literary cliché's.Give Harry Potter a try, Artemis Fowl, Inkheart, The Uncommon Adventures of Tucker O'Doyle, Erec Rex: The Dragon's Eye, etc.",0,0,0,0

The entire book is a who's who of other narcissistic name droppers, who probably cross market with this guy in their own books, too.I know you're thinking ""how could a book with such an...awkward...name, even garner any attention? I've never heard of it. Or this guy"" Ah yes, glad you asked. Like I said, this is just a rehash of every rags to riches to rags and back to riches generic business/leadership book you've ever read, with some Christian stuff thrown in there. They could delete the Christian stuff, throw some Jewish stuff in there, and rebrand it again for that market. It is nothing great. Just average. Just marketing to the captive Christian audience who will buy this purely based on it being Christian and having a review by Max Lucado and Zig Ziglar in it. I guess in that sense, it really does teach you something about business. With the right endorsements, you can sell some people anything.It opens with a preface about not cramming Christianity down your throat, and to enjoy the book anyways. Fair enough. Something isn't worthless just because it's religious. But then, it does exactly that. Every chapter has some sort of God reference, from okay advice, to awful idioms like ""focused intensity over time multiplied by God equals unstoppable momentum"". Really. Really? After swearing not to cram religion down the readers throat, it does exactly that. Over and over and over again.Remember the South Park where Cartman starts a christian band, by taking love songs and changing ""baby"" to the word ""jesus"" and makes a million dollars? It's like that. Instead of business advice like ""even with a plan, things take time"" it would be something like ""even with a plan, it happens on god's time"".

I haven't read the comic, so I can't tell you what I think in that direction.The story is creative, and yes the plot is thin.  Outside the box the theories of this fantasy world are intriguing.  I'm thankful there wasn't as much gore as fans may want, and in my life I don't care for it as I did in my younger days.The only character that had depth was the young adult played by McAvoy.You know what?  I truly believe any film needs characters that you would relate to or get to know and love/like/hate.  Even action films.  I know some of you disagree there, but I think some of the best action films out there have characters that mean something, or learn something or that you can feel for.An assassination group with scruples?  How does killing people fit into any type of ""norm"" for anyone?  Okay, maybe to some people who imagine out there that it would be cool to be a killer.  Society tells people they can't discipline their kids, then when that kid becomes bad it's the parents fault. Hmmmmm, why do we get into these type of movies, and how do we teach our youth that this is not what you want to do, or be or desire to play out?  How can we let them know that we want them to have long, productive lives and have loved ones support them in their endeavors?I wouldn't let my children (18 or below) watch this type of film (the higher age bracket, 16-18, I would make sure they know the difference between real and imaginary - but that's for you all out there.  I would never knowingly attend this type of movie with the entire age group - I think it's inappropriate.)I myself will never watch the film again.

R3TBEGBV4WWMZ7,"Motley Crue faced a difficult period in the 1990's and to certain extends the early 2000's. As a famous 80's act it was though for them to even manage to survive the 90's. Lead singer Vince Neil was out of the band in 1992 and the Crue had to adapt to the changing times and music scene and face a future without Neil. The 1994 self-titled album with replacement singer John Corabi was an excellent album but it didn't sound anything like Motley Crue and a lot of fans couldn't accept someone other than Neil fronting the band, and some people who liked it couldn't accept it because it has the words Motley Crue written on it. 1997's Generation Swine was the band's reunion album with Vince Neil back on board although it was clearly written with Corabi's voice and style in mind and Vince had to fit his voice into a mold that had already been made. Tommy Lee left the band after the Greatest Hits tour in 1999 an a year later we have New Tattoo, an album that aims to capture the band's sound of old whereas their previous two albums were products of their times. New Tattoo was written with Neil's voice in mind which should have been a step in the right direction and Randy Castillo replaces Tommy Lee on drums.There aren't many high points on New Tattoo, the opening track ""Hell On High Heels"" is one song that I still play and I think it fits well along other Motley classics and somewhat succeeded at recapturing their 1980's heyday sound. The album starts out well with what is probably its best song but doesn't go far.  ""Treat Me Like The Dog I am"" is a tad too much on the repetitive and generic side. ""New Tattoo"" the title track is the second highlight for this fan, it's a slower song almost ballad-like and is one of the more enjoyable tracks of the album. The band's cover of ""White Punks on Dope"" is just a pain to listen to. Even the better songs like ""Fake"" and ""Porno"" stars are nothing special. The truth is New Tattoo sounds uninspired, unoriginal and tired and it's easily one of the worst Crue albums, a contender for sure.It's not that Randy Castillo doesn't do a good job here but obviously Tommy Lee's drumming had elements that were crucial to the core of the Crue's sound. The drums here just sound dull and boring as if they're just going through the motions instead of playing a big part of the music like they used to. Even Mick Mars, who usually provides great riffs, flamboyant solos, dirty near bluesy on steroids and distortion-stuff fails to shine here. The version of New Tattoo I own has a bonus live disc consisting of six songs with Samantha Maloney (Hole) on drums but even that can't redeem this album. Interestingly future Sixx A.M. (Nikki Sixx's side project) collaborator James Michael gets co-writing credit on six of the songs.Supposedly New Tattoo was made with the intention of being the album that could have been a follow up to Dr. Feelgood, honestly it simply doesn't work and falls far of achieving what it set out to do. The fact that Motley doesn't even play any songs from this album live is telling. I don't want to sound like the bad guy here but the last time I checked it's ok to have an opinion and this is mine, New Tattoo is a BAD album.  I think the follow up; Saints of Los Angeles (2008) fared much better and was much more honest and Motley-like album. 1 star for ""Hell In High Heels"" and the title track. Quite forgettable. Hardcore fans only.",0,0,0,0
RTQ9PHLK3QZZE,"I made the mistake of listening to folks naysaying the naysayers-- 20/20 hindsight.  Simply put, I had sticker shock from the OEM cartridges, and was living in denial.  Disregard the negative feedback like I did at your own risk!  It seems like the quality of these is a complete craps shoot.  (Either that, or there is some technology afoot to prevent 3rd parties from feeding toner into this printer.)  Anyhow, after about 3 weeks of OEM-comparable printing, the first black cartridge started streaking and becoming lighter and lighter.  Issue was not rectified by fixing unit or ITB cleaning operations.  Tried second black cartridge, and it was printing everything crookedly, like it was somehow messing up the ability of the paper to feed.  (If I had to guess. the very sticky adhesive on the pull strip isn't helping anything-- toner gets everywhere when you pull that puppy off, and it has lines on it from inconsistent release.  And no, practice does NOT make perfect on these-- in my day I've replaced hundreds of toner cartridges.)  Ran down the block to Office Depot, got an OEM cartridge, and it worked like it was supposed to again.  Pretty hard to argue with that!Sadly, for us, we can't have horrible print quality, so these are basically landfill fodder (no, there is no recycling collection with these).  And I personally won't be bothering with the CMY cartridges, I've already lost enough time just getting black working again.  If you do the math on how much output I got out of the black cartridge, I think pro-rated, it's just about break-even with OEM cost.",0,0,0,0

R147VRBVTXED2E,"I really had a lot of fun trying this out in the store.  It highlighted printed text on many surfaces great.  So I purchased it.  It glides smoothly acros the paper and has a great, bright, color.Now for the downside of the review.... I mainly use highlighters to highlight handwritten notes on notebook paper.  All it did was smear it into a smudged mess!  I even waited an hour for it to dry and it still smudged the handritten ink!  Then I tried different types of inks; ballpoint pen, gel pen, rollerball, etc.  The worst was the gel pen, TERRIBLE!!!!  The best was the ball point but it still smudged more than if I had used a traditional highlighter.As noted by other reviewers, it is somewhat like a crayon and I will agree.  With that in mind, as with a crayon, to get a good solid line you have to go over the same line twice or very heavily to get a good color transfer.  I believe that because I had to go over my notes several times to get a good bright highlight color with this ""highlighter"" could be the reason I had so much smearing.I guess it's a toss-up.  You can get either a fun new type of highlighter that won't dry out; but highlights only certain types of ink without smudging with a very light color application in an unpredictable location without crisp start, end, top, or bottom lines of highlight.  Or, you can have a fun new type of highlighter that won't dry out; but creates a huge smudgy mess if you want a decent color transfer without crisp start, end, top or bottom lines of highlight.The choice is up to you, but for me, I think I am going to stick with a traditional hihglighter and wait until the Gimmick is improved before I try iy again!",0,0,0,0

R31WOTU3UCOUXF,"I have only just seen the film, having been obliged to await its arrival on DVD with eager anticipation, as the Oscar nomination and several reviewers spoke so overwhelmingly in its favour.Let me begin by stating that I am completely mystified by the film's positive reception and, so much so, that I feel compelled to air my views publicly. Although most of the performances are certainly acceptable if even excellent by notably the lead and the two main actresses and several of the supporting cast, I personally found it hard to look at the main actor's sidekick, who reminded me uncomfortably of Schwartzenegger with a bad wig. In his defense, I should probably add that he did the best that could have been expected from him with the disgusting part that was written for him.Having said this, my main objection to the film, however, was its unapologetic, torrid subject matter, which actually propogates (and almost approves) of conduct so unbecoming that it left an extremely bad taste in my mouth.  The script also makes absolutely no attempt to excuse the errant behaviour of its main persona.  Of course people such as this probably do exist, but I wish to suggest that too many of their reactions were contrived and ridiculously improbable:  allow me to name the retrieval of the wallet merely as as one such example, but in the end, there are simply too many examples such as this, not to destroy the film's credibility altogether.I was equally appalled by the script's suggestion that wine-tasting by apparent connoisseurs and uncontrolled inebriation may go hand in hand, not to mention its condonation of the sexual mores of its principal characters.  I am by no means conservative or a moralist, but do believe that conduct such of this in a relatively serious film, needs to be qualified to avoid creating the impression that this would be considered normal behaviour under the circumstances.I was equally appalled by the shallowness of the script, the cliched camera work and its heavy-handed and its insensitive approach to life and people in general.In fact, many scenes which were clearly intended to be humerous, failed miserably and merely managed to make me feel vaguely uncomfortable and embarrassed.Finally I would like to end by saying that I find it almost impossible to believe that the film's reviewers were not influenced by reasons of their own.  I do not believe this to simply be a matter of taste.  As the film deals with the consumption of excellent wines to the extent that it does, it would do to be reminded that there exists a very definite distinction between good and bad wines.  Apropos more than a merely superficial inspection this film cannot possibly be considered a good vintage and most certainly one undeserving of its acclaim, the remarkable presence of which prompted this entirely superfluous letter.Yogesh Pama",0,0,0,0

RLO25BIRSILQW,"I had read very good reviews about this book however it fell short of the brilliance i was expecting, both from a literary value and from a storyline point of view. We are presented with two University students who are more self-absorbed in their own politically and socially righteous beliefs that they forget to be human - which in turn leads to self harm due to the stubbornness of expressing feelings because it's a sign of weakness for one of them, and ruining relationships and other people's feelings for social self gratification for the other one. And then there is the married couple facing a plethora of issues and feeding off of the positive influence that these two students have on their own relationship, mental health and happiness, unwilling to face up to the shortcomings of their marriage and happily and selfishly enjoying a revival of their bond off the back of someone else's sacrifice and misery. I found that none of the characters are relatable or even likeable. Numerous aspects are difficult to accept as being realistic - i doubt there are many wives out there who would accept their husbands having an affair with a younger woman and then casually invite her to dinner. In short, this book somehow manages to make self harm, introversion to the point of social and emotional shut down, superficial relationships, multiple relationships at the same time and publicly known extra-marital affairs seem acceptable.

R27X0BPENIUYOT,"Though I'm a little embarassed to review a movie which doesn't move, I'm gutting it out because of Pamela Franklin, one of the two cutest actresses in history (the other  being Genevieve Bujold), and in my view the *only* reason for watching this film. Having said that, I don't believe it's as bad as Leonard Maltin thinks it is, because there are a couple sequences in it, especially the one where Pamela goes, lamp in hand, down to the basement level of the schoolhouse in the midst of a thunderstorm, that are atmospheric -- not exactly classic Gothic stuff, but still passably good for a low-budget TV movie. In fact, most of the cast is either superior or respectable (not excluding Jo Van Fleet as the schoolmistress, and of course Roy Thinnes as the eponymous heavy). The problem is the contrived and pointless plot -- it's never explained why Satan, assuming He exists, should show up in this ridiculous little schoolhouse -- unless, like me, He's got a yen for Pamela (or Kate), so when we see him at the end of the film before his ""coven"" of acolytes with a monumental simper on his face, it's more outlandish than anything Aleister Crowley could have dreamed of. At that point, my jaw dropped about 5 inches, but not from horror. For her part, Pamela shows awesome professionalism in a role which insults her acting talent, but which still can't succeed in concealing her charm.

But once Music is My Savior dropped, so did the buzz. This album ain't hot and this is why, this is why:MIMS goes through every song with played out thug-isms like pushing nice whips, pulling easy honeys, and challenging wack rappers in his spare time.

I then looked at it in the store and know why I decided to give it a try. This is a Hugo and Nebula award winning author, and I am very familiar with those prizes. In the past some of my favorite reads were Science Fiction and figured that, not being familiar with current authors, this would be a good choice. Wrong. The writing is ordinary. It's boring and leaves one wondering when to ditch it and move on. I would hate to think of this as an introduction to Science Fiction for someone, because they would get a poor impression indeed. Some of the most moving and entertaining books I have read have been SF. Good SF can be very diverse, but not ever boring and always worth the time.What I don't understand is all the 5 star reviews!

I think my wife and I chuckled at exactly one line in the movie.  Maybe if I hadn't heard so much about how funny it was, I could've appreciated it as a non-comedy.  But as a comedy, it falls flat.Other reviewers are correct that the acting was excellent.  Too many times an actor takes the blame for poor directing, editing, script, etc.  In this case, I think the film got a lot of kudos due to the fine acting.The scenery is gorgeous.  My wife and I recently toured through some California wineries and the cinematography brought all of that back.  But I never mistook my good feelings about California wine country with good feelings about the movie.All I ask in a movie is to give me characters, however flawed, that I CARE about.  In this movie, the main characters were people I wouldn't give the time of day.  All we SAW was their flaws.  In order to care, we need to see some good qualities early in the movie.  Some good qualities are revealed too late in this movie to make me think more than, ""Well, maybe he's not a TOTAL loser"".

R2WZ0PDYH7LKXU,"There are more than enough reviews here of this book and all the Castaneda books, so I'll try to make this short. I've read all of Castaneda's books, and although this is the first, the one that 'started it all', I would advise skipping it. That's because by Carlos' own admission, when he wrote this one he was still under the impression that the hallucinogenic peyote/mescaline given to him was the focal point for the 'sorcerer' training he was receiving. By the third book,  Journey to Ixtlan: The Lessons of Don Juan , he knew better, was also a better writer, and was better able to lay out spiritual teachings that would be of value to almost any reader.For what it's worth, I think the three best books to read overall, the three with the most value for almost any reader are  Journey to Ixtlan: The Lessons of Don Juan , Tales of Power , and  The Power of Silence: Further Lessons of don Juan . These really cover the true teachings the best, interspersed with Carlos' signature dramatic stories. I think the themes of these books have the most spiritual value, and steer clear of some of the darker, occult themes and battles, as well as drug-use, that characterize some of the other books.As for the debate about what's 'real' and what's 'fiction' in these books, my own view is, 'what does it matter?' Try one and see if it resonates. Our perception of reality, including our ideas about 'truth' and 'fiction', are the central theme these books explore. Allow yourself to be taken in, and then make of it what you will.",0,0,0,0

R25T2L1ROZF0K0,"Honestly, I was and still am very open minded. The entire read, I was actually buying most of what Dr. Schoch was saying about diffusion, and how it relates to different civilizations across the world being related to each other. I've always been inclined towards this type of anthropological thinking, in spite of critics. However, I’m suddenly very very sad. When I came to the section about Leviathon, which is a Sea monster mentioned in Job (41:15-34) – and other places in the Hebrew Scriptures, I couldn’t believe what he was writing. As a scholar in this field for many years, I anxiously looked up the references to Leviathon that he specifically referred to as a creature that flew. I was able to consult all different types of literature. One was the Jewish Talmud (~200BCE-500CE) – whose ideas are demonstratively earlier. Along with this, I also used a concordance to search the main Hebrew Bible too, to see how this term was used in other places. I also consulted the folk lore, and sometimes very ancient sources called Midrash. And lastly, I consulted pseudopigraphal works like Enoch. UNFORTUNATELY, nowhere in Jewish tradition could I find any reference to LEVIATHON as a flying creature. On the contrary, it is always mentioned as a swimming creature (with scales), with numerous mentions of being or dwelling in the sea.Honestly, at this point, I’m not sure how to proceed. All along, I had given him the benefit of the doubt, and assumed that he was mostly accurate. Now that I see this is not the case, I’m starting to wonder about all the other things he has said so far, as he brings and compares to other doctrines and religious dogmas throughout the world. I’m worried he wasn’t careful about them either. Amazingly, he really didn't need to force the Leviathon to be a dragon anyways. He could have just stuck with the meteor in scripture angle - which could be better references. Right now, I’m just sitting here, staring at the book, and feeling horrible. How can I logically finish up to his final conclusions - knowing he wasn’t careful about this Hebrew Doctrine. And while there were different types of serpents or cobras in Jewish sources, that may have subbed for (non-flying) serpents or dragons, they were never understood as flying creatures. I just wanted to let you know about these inaccuracies. I think he has taken too many liberties. My recommendation is for him to re-review the book, not just for references to the Leviathon. Surely, he needs to re-review everything, to make sure he is accurately portraying the dogma of the people he quotes. Perhaps he may be able to salvage his entire theory, depending on how accurate he has been in other areas. Or perhaps not. That remains to be seen. Sorry for having to tell you all this… He may still be RIGHT about his thesis, I can not say, but he took religious research a bit too lightly for my comfort.",0,0,0,0

Minerva turned into a complete goose. And Lord Langley was a middle-aged man behaving like a teenager...totally unrealistic and with absolutely no connection to each other or to me as reader. I made it half way through and then gave up because my brain was fried. What started so well in the first few pages with so much humour turned into a manic farce.

R1SC05MM0HKG8B,"This was twice as thick as it needed to be, and left out half the story that mattered, instead endlessly repeating the conclusion that was obvious from the outset.Yes, Elizabeth Holmes, a 20-something college drop-out, managed to fool not only investors,  but Secretaries of State and Defense - Kissinger to George Shultz to  Jim Mattis - that she, with her 'bright blue eyes'  was another Steve Jobs- to do for blood tests, what he had done with the iPhone.  wtf?! you mean to say that she fooled all Federal regulators for 10 years (!), thanks to help from a crooked boyfriend, and lawyer thugs like the famed David Boies  (Bush v. Gore) to intimidate any competitors or scrutiny!  Didnt you read about the 'blue eyes' already!? Sorry, but when we read about why a technology failed, even through the eyes of Wall Street Journalist ( top boss = Rupert Murdoch of the esteemed Fox News), we need dont need just a repetitive listing of how human organizations failed, or were fooled by a charlatan  The idea was supported by a famed Stanford chemistry professor after all, so we need an technical analysis of why the technology did not work.  The Titanic was built to be unsinkable, with a series of flood isolating compartments, but not only an icerberg, but an iceberg striking it at the critical pattern to cause flooding in the front, building up water pressure, to pop sealing rivets, caused water to pour from compartment to compartment, front to back, so that the ships designer, on board, realized that it would sink eventually as 'a mathematical certainty'  this is where Carreyrou is underwhelming, he keeps recounting all the bullying, the thieving, the hiding, the thuggery , while saying nothing of why, for over 10 years,  some very smart people, in this age of technology, did not ask for the data that would support 'blue eyes' extraordinary claim that over 200 blood tests could be done on a few drops of blood.  Company I used to work for, Intel, was famously 'data driven'.  You have to be in the modern age - else your customer will find out your product sucks, your revenue will be less than your expenses, and then your investors will know where to find you!  Bad Blood explains nothing of why this never happened, in 10 years, not only with Kissinger, but Stanford chemistry professors.

I have 2 admit this movie is realy diffrent from the modern movies i watch evry friday. It is diffrent in a bad way it was to long, it has to much talking , and has a story line dat changes evry 15 minutes. It was a good story if u get da main picture of da whole movie , wich most teenagers like me dont , the things the same about this movie like the movies i watch , would have to be the gun fights, hot chicks and all the vilence. This movie is a typical western do to its shootouts, gunfights, saloons, horses, and cowboys. The peaple who made this movie made a mistake by making it to predictable because from evry scene you watch you know whats gona happen in the next scene. The little scenes kill the movies in some ways but help it in many others.

R3O8F0U00DEHQ7,"I was extremely disappointed with this film after all the hype. There were so many cliches in it- the homophobe who is a closet homosexual, the sexually repressed suburban couple who end up having affairs to get out of their stale lives, the militarist who happens to have Nazi memoribilia, the girl whom everybody wants who turns out to be dull and insecure and sexually inexperienced etc. The filming was not particularly great either. Lawn Dogs perhaps examines bourgeois/suburban paranoia and complexes with better skill.So what does work at all? Perhaps a non-American directing, or the eccentric boy across the street who turns out to be the most interesting character. Oh and a couple of mildly funny jokes.

R13WPJLU9L5X1B,"I consider myself a very informed consumer especially on fountain pens. I enjoy them very much but something about spending 50$+ on a pen always requires a lot of mental brainwashing with positive reviews/feedback to get me to buy a $$$ pen. I often make this comparison, I can buy a Table saw... or a fountain pen! Yes they are indeed instruments of luxury and I am as frugal as it gets so it makes a bitter standstill sometimes. However if you are like me and read even a little into fountain pens you will find Pilot pens to be dripping in positivity. Their metropolitan,74, Falcon, ect. The list goes on. I have used every one and let me tell you none (including this one) have done anything for me.The pen itself is well build and it gives thick durable feel to it, something you know would withstand a drop. It weighs 22.36g with a CON-70 converter in it half full. Which to reference is less than a metropolitan (27.28g). If you are someone who likes huge, thick, heavy pens this one is right on the acceptable line. It's a standard thickness in the hand for a pen. Overall this pen is an okay looking pen, I personally believe the saying ""beauty is in the eye of the beholder"" to be untrue as almost everyone can tell you what is nice looking and what is not. By that standard I can say I think you will find this pen to not be very eventful looking. The cap is a screw on/off which I enjoy very much as it adds a level of security to potential splashes from drops and or just general lugging around. The nib is silver not the gold tint that you see here. Don't Panic! it's gold. If you look at the nib it will say 14k. The build quality is the only reason for the 2 stars.Writing is what you would expect from a Pilot Pen. Awful, inconsistent, Skippy at best. The pen will write very good so long as you only write down. So if your name is ilililil you're in good shape, my name however is nick and when wrote with this pen it comes out as ""l l i c l"". A majority of the days this pen choose to write dry (that's what I wanted) however during this time your pen will often bottom out and not lay down any ink and skip. Other days it will chose to write like a wet medium which makes your handwriting look like a gorilla wrote it, thick and bumpy. The nib is as springy as you would expect from a gold nibbed pen but that really is about it. The reason I was so persistent on pilots was because positive reviews and the statement that eastern pens supposedly have finer nibs. This is partially true, outside of some German pens most fines are about all the same. My Parker and Lamy write just as fine as this. So the allure to stick to eastern pens just because of a finer fine is so negligible.What I don't understand is the ?fan base? of pilot pens. Doing deeper reading on this pen you will find it's inconsistency to be a not so much a problem but a guarantee. The fountain pen community is a very tight-knit community and most well seasoned fountain pen owners DO NOT recommend this pen or the 92 for the same reasons above. However there is always a group of people that love their pilot pens. There is a story of a guy who got a pilot 92 that didn't work day 1. He sent it in to pilot for repair and after 3 send backs to pilot later to get it fixed and 4 months of down time it still came back still inconsistent, the guy was bummed but still LOVED his junk pen. All in all after getting burned by multiple pilot pens at varying price points I can say for certain I will never buy a Pilot again, the proof is in the writing.Buy a Lamy 2000, now that is a thing to behold.",0,0,0,0
R1KANLLN0BZ17J,"One of the earlier reviewers pointed this out, but I want to amplify the comment.  One of the reasons we buy expensive vinyl is for the form factor itself - we want the excellence of a physical record.  This album from the Czech Republic is mastered at the wrong speed.  When played at 33rpm it slow-w-w-w-s the music down and drags the pitch down with it.  It sounds better for pitch when played at 45 rpm, but I don't trust that the pitch is true to life and, if you understand the physics of a needle tracking in a groove, the faster the platter spins, the worse it is for accuracy of reproduction.

It ....In a way, it's sad.  I spent the first hour thinking ""it'll improve soon. Really.  Just as soon as the flashback stops/ Jennifer Garner turns up/ Bullseye appears.""  How can i put this - it DIDN'T.The first warning is the title sequence (yes, it's that bad), curiously reminiscent of.. Spiderman! Surprise. Not the last time I would be thinking that, either.OK, nice first image; gothic, creepy.  That red leather isn't *quite* working, but it's early days, right...?Wrong. Cue a, what, 20 minute flashback that exists purely to pile sentimental ... upon more sentimental ....  I'm not caring already.  The trailer sold me cool fights... um, don't expect a ... thing until the childhood trauma is well and truly driven home with a sledgehammer.  And the really sad thing?  It's nothing new. It's nothing we haven't seen a billion times before, better acted, and most definitely better scripted.After the sentimental stuff, a couple of flashes of how good this could have been, given a little talent: the rendering of the 'radar' sense (whilst entirely illogical) is clever and cinematically works. It's new, it's *different*.Here, the plot departs from logic with screaming haste.  Yes, we understand little Matt has the radar-sense-thingy.  We do not understand, and are never offered any explanation for, why he is suddenly as agile as Spidey. Only, y'know, lacking any visible webslinging powers. Note to the cack-handed scriptwriter/ director: THIS MAKES NO SENSE. It so obviously exists purely to provide 'cool' visuals in the fight scenes that, quite frankly, aren't even done very well.Moving swiftly on... I don't remember Ben Affleck ever being quite this dire. After an embarrassingly bad courtroom scene, the first action set piece is.. yup, pretty dire. The leather outfit gets worse by the moment. The requisite cool visuals are completely obscured half the time, which left me blinking in confusion as to who or what was supposedly getting their ... kicked.  I was still blinking in confusion a minute later, when I realised someone had been watching the subway scene from The Matrix a little too often... and then comes a little character development that makes me wonder why this guy is our hero, exactly.Still, that little spark of hope remains... the script perks up with the entrance of Jon Favreau.  The guy's funny, he gets a couple of decent lines, and hey, Elektra's about to turn up...*shudder*  Jennifer Garner can act. Jennifer Garner can fight convincingly on screen. I know this, having sat through a season of Alias.  Guess what?  This script (and fight choreography) doesn't seem to agree.  I kept expecting her to break into one of Sydney's tortured speeches (anything being better than the drivel that passes for character development in this) but no.  The initial showdown between her and Matt in a kid's playground is so barkingly nonsensical that I was staring at the screen in disbelief.And so on and so forth.  It's not even enjoyably bad; it just keeps setting up potentially cool scenarios, only to fail to see them through.  In some ways, it does perk up when Bullseye shows up.  A barely recognisable Colin Farrell gurns his way through as a manic little leprechaun who can't miss a shot to kill anyone with *anything* (old lady with peanut was a classic.  In a completely amoral way...).  Kingpin is, frankly, a bit underwhelming.  On the plus side, some fairly decent songs are used to drown out the bad acting most of the time.. the soundtrack looks half decent, considering...The Valentine day opening means one trailer campaign focuses on the romantic pairing of Matt and Elektra, which is ironic given that this is one of the least convincing screen romances I've ever seen.  She likes him because.. um, well, cos he's blind? He likes her because, hey, she's hot. And she can kick .... For Absolutely No Apparent Reason. I'm guessing a whole chunk of backstory got ditched along the way, but what is unforgiveable is the waste of the only source of tension this plot has in their relationship.  Far as I can see, this should have been what the plot hinged upon. As it is, it's meaningless and shallow, aiming to set up a sequel far too lazily.That's a prospect that really irritates me: a sequel to a film that managed to spend this much money on such an awful script and bad direction (the same guy being responsible for both should give you a clue).  I spent half the plot wondering if anyone had bothered to proofread the script before they went into production, as it unashamedly and amateurly ... half a dozen better movies without drawing breath (mainly Spiderman and the Matrix).  Sure, girls may go to drool over Ben Affleck, but the guy has never looked less attractive (get that flabby, unshaven chin beneath the halloween mask. *urgh*). Sure, guys may go for the action (hmm. Could do much, much better.) They'd all be better off staying home to watch Spiderman again, unfortunately.Here's me wishing I had...",0,0,0,0

R2LIUIFL59BY4J,"I wanted to love this item and was incredibly disappointed when it arrived broken in multiple pieces. Out of the hundreds of items I've purchased from Amazon over the years, this will mark the first time I've ever requested to return an item for a refund rather than an exchange.Here's what's great about this item: The design is ingenious, the layout maximizes use of space and is ergonomically efficient by allowing frequently accessed items to be readily available. It places everything you need throughout a normal course of day spent conducting business right at your fingertips. This makes for a clean and functional workspace.However, brilliant design is worthless without equitable material...I agree with a comment by a previous reviewer, who stated ""The price is just too high to excuse poor quality."" Even if this hadn't arrived shattered in several pieces, I would not have been impressed as a result of its substandard material and lack of quality control.The plastic is incredibly thin and flimsy. (I included a picture depicting how it's barely thicker than a nickel.) It feels cheap and is reminiscent of product shipping material. Really, it reminds me of the containers used by Starbucks for salads and yogurt parfaits... Which is great for disposable containers but certainly no where near where where it should be for a fixed organizer that is to be displayed next to expensive technology.I must address the extent to which this item arrived damaged...... It wasn't just a few little scratches or chip... It arrived in 7 individually shattered parts. As the external box was fully intact, I do not believe the damage was incurred during shipping. When I opened the external shipping box, I observed that the internal (product) box was torn open. One of the plastic chunks was floating outside of it. To determine if I wanted a replacement, I arranged the pieces together in order to gauge how it functions when undamaged. Here's the kicker:The broken parts did NOT create a whole unit! There were missing peices! This leads me to conclude that it was damaged to the extend in which it was unusable PRIOR to being shipped. Did this vendor knowingly sent out an unusable item in hope that it could turn a profit? Perhaps it's a numbers game? Maybe the majority of people won't go through the hassle of returning products in this price range, so they continue to capture profit off damaged inventory...? I hope that's not the case because that's the epiphany of SCANDALOUS business practices! ... But at the very least, the facts hint at this being a possibility...",0,0,0,0

RDSYKFFI37TSH,"I'd really rather not be giving this phone system a 2-star rating because it actually has quite a few snazzy features which work well. Unfortunately, the main feature that differentiates it from similar - and less expensive - phones is a washout (at least for my personal home - yours may vary). Specifically, the exterior doorbell which sends either a snapshot or video feed of the person at your door is all but useless during the daytime, sending only a black silhouette image (hence ""The Shadow"" reference) with a blown-out bright background. There's no possible way of identifying who is at your door unless they have a really distinctively shaped head.The night vision works better - lighting up a face in almost complete darkness and, as a bonus, giving your visitor that ""Blair Witch"" quality that everyone enjoys on a dark and stormy night. But seriously, if your main concern is seeing faces at night then you may be well served by this phone/doorbell combination.Again, I've got no problem with the phone's other functions, all of which seem to work well: answering machine, intercom function between handsets, speakerphone, etc. For that matter, the audio doorbell function works well - your visitor pushes the doorbell, and it will sound wherever your handsets are (useful for me because my existing doorbell can't be heard in my home office). But that feature alone doesn't make it worth the bother of installing the external unit...and being haunted by the glowing (albeit pretty) screens on the telephone handsets reminding you of a feature which doesn't work.If V-tech finds a way to solve the backlighting problem (maybe a quick LED flash?) then they'll have a pretty nice product here.",0,0,0,0

Portman was believable in her emotion, and Weaving was great at portraying emotion even with his face concealed by a mask.  But for me, that's where it ends.I do not understand the opinion of who say this movie is 'thought-provoking' or 'deep' in any sense.  It has been pointed out in previous reviews, that right-wingers are the only ones finding any thing wrong with this movie, because it offends their political views.  Now, I'm not a conservative, but could it also be said that left-wing people find it enjoyable because it somehow supports their beliefs?First of all, the 'hero' wears the mask of a religious extremist himself.  How ironic is that?  A brief history lesson of Guy Fawkes will tell you that he tried to blow up the House of Lords not to gain 'freedom' for the masses, but because Fawkes was a Catholic and James I was a Protestant.So V tries to free everyone through violence, and in the end, he leaves everyone else to clean up the mess and fill the power vacuum that is left behind.  Just like a terrorist.  Create mayhem and destruction for thier own views, and leave the rest of us to pick up the pieces and move on.  This movie was juvenile in its themes and ideas, most notably that the UK would ever be ruled by a Christian regime.

R3VAX78AE3WATQ,"The only reason I didn't cancel my purchase was because only verified purchasers can write reviews. And I feel strongly about this book. The positives:* The writing style is very good (it flows, character development is good)* There weren't any annoying typos, which can yank you right out of the story when there are enough of themThe negatives:* There was practically no plot. Boy meets girl, girl's fiance dies under slightly suspicious circumstances, and then there was no further tension until more than halfway through the book. Then there's a bit more plot (not much). I kept hoping there would be SOMETHING. Something involving the vintage t-shirts, maybe? The sister Bell? Something beyond the yadda yadda about the evolving love interest. Because several hundred pages of two people reconnecting after five years and falling in love, knit together by sex scenes, no matter how hot, does not a book make. Plus, the  journal's 'here's how we're going to let the reader in on what's really going on' device towards the end was cheesy-easy.* This story chopped off in the middle, making it crystal clear that you have to pay for the sequel to find out what happens to the characters. Online writers these days seem to be trending toward not wrapping up their stories, as a 'hook' to get you to buy the sequel. A quality author doesn't do this.

R3RUIATROSFSUK,"Well here comes, there goes, ""Nip Tuck"". After six seasons the production team have moved on to a new and more successful show. It is such a shame that (quite obviously) the team that gave us five funny, crazy, fascinating, ridiculous seasons should opt out so lamely at the end. There is no doubt in my mind that Ryan Murphy and his team were a little distracted when they were putting this season together, and who could blame them. At the same time they were creating the most exciting and successful new TV sensation of the decade. But what ""Glee"" has gained, ""Nip Tuck"" has sadly lost. This looks like a contractual obligation on everyone's parts, but if the ridiculous hairbrained, repetitious storylines aren't enough, the actors looked positively bored and almost embarassed by it all . I remember in the Australian press Julian McMahon making some sort of critical remark about the last season when he had to return suddenly to tend to his ailing (famous)mother who sadly has since died. Why didnt they leave it at season five, one of the best seasons of the series. Nothing is new here and the guest (patients)stars seem to dominate. The regular player are bit by bit written out in less than satisfactory ways. Kelly Clarkson's""suicide"" looks like a plot device for her to return in the final episodes, when she doesnt, you ponder in amazement that such a vital character from the series could be written out in such an inappropriate and unbelievable way.I give it two stars only because the wondrous Vanessa Redgrave returns for two episodes and her moments are the best in the series. Joely Richardson, the other reason for making this season almost bearable is also back but only for four episodes out of nineteen. Her exit is contrived and if you want total nonsense see what happens to John Hensley, whose unlikeable character probably deserves what he gets in the end, but it would have been nice if he had been given some positive finale, some sort of learning or redemption. But no, off he goes into another disaster.As to the two central characters, well, I wouldnt have minded if ""sean"" had jumped off a boat in the first episode, Julian remains the most developed character, but clearly is out the door long before the final credits. The series has outstayed its welcome and best for us to remember the good times, of which this season certainly is not. !!",0,0,0,0
R46GTKZXEMB78,"This book was my least favorite in the series, by a lot. Which makes me sad/mad because it is the one I was most looking forward to. The 12 Dancing Princesses is my favorite fairytale and one that doesn’t get retold that often. But getting through this book was grueling. It dragged by at a snail’s pace and was way too long. I was aggravatingly waiting for something to take away from it.Like the 1st two in this series this one is NOT a romance. This one had even less romance than the first two. Ilani and Kyril didn’t even meet until over 30% of the way through. They then meet briefly (60 seconds tops), meet for maybe 30 minutes, then maybe 15 and that’s it until the end. They don’t even kiss at all. COME ON!!! Even Disney gives me a kiss at the end!There were so many twists and turns it felt like a roller coaster, and while that may appeal to some readers I was so uninvested in the characters that I couldn’t care less and just wanted it to stop. It doesn’t have to be that complicated! I am all for adding background and plot to fairy tales but it loses its fairy tale quality when you make so complex that you have to get a pen and paper to map out all the plot twists. It also makes it more likely to be contrived and full of plot holes. For example, Ilani is injured for having magic and her sisters completely ignore and exclude her for 12 years because they ""think she prefers it that way."" What? No.There is way too much dialogue. Almost the whole story is told through dialogue.This story, unlike the books 1 & 2, is really more of ensemble cast rather than a story about a Hero & heroine. We get the perspective of several characters throughout the book and almost more of the story focuses on all the surrounding characters than the “main” 2.I liked Kyrill in Traitor’s Mask but didn’t feel like he was even the same character in Pirouette. He was weak and whiney. Ilani was a nice character who made me feel something. Brenna was strongly featured in the book, maybe more than the other 2, and really is the hero of the story and the best character.I really can’t figure out who this author’s target audience is. I would recommend to YA readers since the romance is so G-rated, but there is quite a bit of swearing and violence. I’m not sure why you would include cursewords but ZERO physical romance. I just can’t figure it out, but I have decided after 3 of these that I will not be reading any more.Davidson’s writing is very good, and her character development is well done. And, at least this one was a fantasy. I feel bad for giving 2-stars, I know the author worked hard on it, but I just cannot justify even 1 more star. Others may appreciate this book more than me, I encourage you to read through the reviews and give it a try if you are a fan of the 1st two in the series.",0,0,0,0
R102H3JTKCPOT1,"Reading the reviews beforehand, I thought it would be more adjustable.  It would probably work fine on a square armrest, but did not work well on my curved armrest. It was always sliding off, threatening to spill everything out of the pockets.  There are lots of pockets, which is good, but they could've been sized better for remotes (the pockets were too big and the remotes would lean this way and that, making the whole thing more unstable).  It's not very attractive either, which I didn't think I'd care about when I bought it, but seeing it on my chair it always drew the eye and looked bulky and out of place.  It's an okay product, but I have buyer's remorse after this purchase.  It's stored away in a closet already, and I've only had it a few weeks.",0,0,0,0

R309K7W3BBVV5U,"I'm about to order my third Commodore II chair, just about a month shy of three years since I bought my current one.  That's about how many years I get out of them before they die.  Earlier today I came into my office, took a seat in my chair... and immediately sank to the floor as the gas strut failed.  That's what happened to the last one too and it's not that I'm overloading them either.  The chairs are rated to 350 lbs. and I'm barely 280, so well within the limitations.  Still, these are the only chairs affordable enough for me that also include a back and headrest tall enough for my 6'2"" body to lean back in and be properly supported.  Heck, the number of naps I've taken in these chairs makes the cost per year of use pretty reasonable, though I do wish they'd last longer.EDIT 03/30/21: About to order my 4th chair.  This last one lasted a whopping 9 months from unboxing to today.  I purchased it in Nov of 2018 but didn't unbox it because we were moving at the end of 2019.  Then Covid hit and that delayed things a year so I unboxed it last June.  As of this week it sinks halfway to the floor every time I sit in it.  These chairs are rated for 350 lbs but I'm just 285.  I think the ratings are just optimistic baloney and not based on actual tests or data.",1,1,0,1

R1XZ532IX6WVHG,"I agree with what reviewer Curtis Reed said about this book.  It is a good read in this genre and I genuinely liked the story.  It was entertaining enough to keep me reading.  The touches of humor were welcome and there were a few standout, memorable lines.What I didn't care for at all was the production values of the book. Cheap paper, lousy, tiny font, and worse editing.  I'm an avid reader and one who does not give up on a book easily, but the poor print quality of this book almost forced me to do so.Even at that, I would have given this book three or four stars if the author hadn't left me hanging at the end.  I really hate that.  An author should never end a book in the middle of a scene.  It's rude and disrespectful to the reader.  I would have greatly preferred it if Joe Nobody had tied this book up when they arrived at their canyon ranch, and then offered a preview of his next book and he could have ended that preview any way he liked without ticking me off.I will not buy his next book in this series because the way he ended this one left me feeling cheated.

R3SLXTW9MK4PK9,"I purchased the GameSir T1s because it is laid out like the PS3 Dual Shock controller. It feels great in the hands, comfortable to hold, though not as nice as the PS3 DS. Solidly built, buttons feel great, but the D-Pad does take a little more effort to push down than I'd like. The buttons light up, but I always turn them down to help save on battery life.Connects via Bluetooth to my Android phone easily, HOWEVER, I've had it disconnect in the middle of gameplay several times. It does easily reconnected, but this is an annoyance that I never had with my SteelSeries controller. On another connectivity note, there is some Bluetooth lag, to fix this I turn my phone Location OFF and put it into Airplane mode.The battery life is NOT 18+ hours. It's not even close! I'd say I can get 5 hours of gameplay. That is a generous estimate, though, and I must say it is quite disappointing...especially since it is advertised as 18+ hours.Overall, I like this controller, but the Bluetooth disconnection problems and the significantly less than 18+ hours of battery life really pulls my rating down.",0,0,0,0

R28KP7NSSZ825R,"There are a few nuggets in the book, which is why I gave it a 2-star rating instead of a 1-star rating. However, anyone with knowledge of Taoism has already laid hold of these basic concepts and has moved on to deeper things. For those unfamiliar with the philosophy of the Tao, this book will likely do more harm than good, especially for the uncritical reader. The author does not demonstrate a good grasp of communication through language and often rambles inanely. In this, he might think he is demonstrating the Tao, but rather, he is demonstrating his own ineptness. As he rails loudly against ""Brain,"" it appears to the reader that perhaps he does so because this is what he lacks most. Besides the juvenile rant against anything scientific and/or intellectual, his downright critical tirade against any viewpoints but his own leaves a bitter taste in the reader's mouth. This is not the Tao. So, while the idea of taking the simple stories of Pooh and his friends and illustrating the Tao has merit, in my opinion, this author fails miserably in his attempt. The place to start for any reader of English should probably be one of many decent English translations of the Tao Te Ching, which one may find simply by searching the Internet.",0,0,0,0

R1I16KA8FCX8MC,"I read the first few Cornwell novels with great delight.  They were interesting mysteries with forenics at their core and way out ahead of the CSI craze.  Then things started to change.  Scarpetta gets the hots for a married man and things decline from there.I left this series a few books ago in mid-book when Scarpetta's inferiority became full blown, i.e.  the other detectives backed away from the crime scene because I was in charge now.  A male CSI would have never said something like that.Now jumping back into Scarpetta's life in Blow Fly, I find things haven't got any better.  According to Cornwell every character, Scarpetta, Lucy, Wesley and Marino, is intellectually superior to the rest of the world and the world hates them for it, has conspired against them and has reduced each to a shadow of their former selves.  She spends pages and pages of this book lauding each of them while at the same time letting you know how the evil forces of the world, i.e. criminals, politicians, jealous cops and lawyers (by God, how Cornwell hates lawyers (guess she never met a dedicated prosecutor or a defense attorney working for next to nothing to get innocent people off death row)).At any rate, to be fully engaged in any story, you have to like and care about the characters.

But I really wish I bought a different product.I bought this to add some extra storage for a new vanity set up. I knew it was on the smaller side than a more faithful Ikea Alex dupe, plus it was a true black finish, so I thought it would be a good fit for my needs since I didn’t plan on putting in anything really big. Plus, it was made of solid wood for the frame instead of chipboard throughout, so it had to be sturdy, right?I wish I paid more attention to the reviews.The wood is not well treated. It splintered in many spots and lacks predrilled holes where I feel they are needed to prevent splintering or screws being put in at bad angles. Some pieces arrived split and splintered in spots. This caused me to forego some screws, though luckily no where I think it is really needed for structural support. But this issue could happen easily somewhere that it is needed.I hade a hard time getting the casters in and needed to find a piece of wood that would fit above the wheels to hammer in the last one without breaking it. Major design flaw.The casters are just plastic bars, and they cause a lot of friction with pulling the drawers in and out. Some drawers take a little more effort to pull open than others. They’re also white and because the drawer faces aren’t designed to perfectly fill the frame, you can see them which is not particularly attractive. Mine might look worse because of the lack of predrilled holes to help keep the drawers uniform when you assemble them. It looks as cheap as it is, which is sad because I’ve paid the same price at Target for shelves that look great.At the end of the day, flat pack furniture that isn’t wall mounted should ideally only require a screwdriver and a mallet to assemble properly. Affordable flat pack furniture should for people that don’t have access to power tools. This required a power drill, an extra wood bit, and would have benefited from me using my leveler.

R25ZVUSXAIIHVW,"The BasicsSomething terrible happens to an aeroplane on the tarmac at JFK Airport New York, and it is up to a lone-wolf disease specialist to find out what the hell is going on. Things quickly go from weird to  troublesome when the plague that killed the passengers on the plane starts to spread throughout the Big Apple.The GoodThe bad guys don't sparkle.Sorry, I know that technically counts as a spoiler, the bad guys in The Strain are vampires, and it took a long time for the authors to clarify that point to the reader. But really, the vampires in this book are some mean-ass blood suckers, not the pretty, picking flowers and holding hands kind. I like that.The BadWhere do I start?I had high hopes for The Strain when I started reading it, but I quickly lost interest and found the plot and characters so absurd that I just couldn't take the story seriously. I finished though, but only so that I could write this review and warn you of how bad this book is.The Strain is a non-stop cliché treadmill and the poor reader is left wading through flat dialogue, weird metaphors, and phrases that make you laugh out loud at the worst possible moment. There is the shadowy cabal; the brilliant-genius CDC scientist hero; the beautiful, sexually accommodating female sidekick who takes a back seat and never does anything useful (except babysit while the MEN go off to slay the big baddie at the end of the book).The authors seem to be very confused about what causes the vampirism. Is it a virus? Is it a worm in your blood? Who can tell.And what kills vampires again? The authors throw out the usual methods (holy water, crucifix through the heart etc.) but cling to sunlight (maybe). It's confusing. The rules change as you read the book and that sucks. If you are writing off-canon you need to at least be consistent about the things you change.The Bottom LineI think this story would make a great movie. It's full of action, the plot is thin, and the characters make up for their vapid lack of depth by being good looking and/or OSSUM. But, as a book it fails. And apparently there are two more books coming out (it's a freaking trilogy!), I won't be reading those.If you want good vampire fiction, read I Am Legend, it kicks The Strain's ass a thousand times over.",0,0,0,0

He even names the evil empire, ""the Empire""!

Don't tell me that Eragon was worried.  SHOW me by telling me that Eragon's brow wrinkled or he pulled at his face with open hands or some such VISUAL clue that he was worried.  His adjectives and adverbs often feel as if he'd simply pulled them from a thesaurus and he had never heard of the words until then.There are COUNTLESS illogical situations that made me want to give up on the book long before I finished it.  Eragon is traveling to the Varden along with Murtagh and the poisoned elf.  They have a dragon and 2 horses and need to get there ASAP but instead of Eragon flying there via his dragon, they'd rather trot along on horses!  Boy, I really felt the suspense.  It simply is a reflection of the lack of reasoning skills of the author due to his age.No real resolution is achieved by the end of the book but much is revealed along the way.The battle scene at the end was so devoid of graphic descriptions and suspense that it seemed the author was unsure exactly who his audience should be.  Out of thousands of Urgals, Dwarves and men, only one or two is described as dying.I could go on but I won't.  This book is probably worth two stars but I gave one to try and offset the hundreds of reviews by readers who are not yet to the age where they can understand exactly what ""master Paolini"" has accomplished.  I think he could be a great writer - in time.Summary: If you are new to epic fantasy literature, by all means, read this if you want.  Otherwise, avoid it.  Why waste your time on a two-star work when there are more five-star works than you could read in a lifetime?",0,0,0,0
R2PTCBREQF417D,"Using this staple gun requires two screwdrivers and needle nose pliers, because it jams constantly. Usually you can get the stuck staples out by prying with a flat nose screwdriver, and pulling it out with the pliers. But sometimes you have to remove the tray that holds the staples, and that takes a second Phillips screwdriver. Fortunately that requires removing only one screw, the sliver headed one at the back. Unfortunately that screw has an easy-to-lose nut on the other side that you'll need to keep track of. The other black screws just screw into the body - I assume that they put a nut on this one because you will be taking it out so frequently that you would eventually strip the threads if it screwed into the body.As I say, it jams constantly regardless of what material you are driving staples into. Somehow, sometimes the staples wind up upside-down inside the body. Sometimes they just come out completely twisted. It will not reliably drive a staple into soft pine. so keep a hammer handy to finish tapping the staple flush. Even stapling paper to cardboard is problematic. Jams for no reason.I give it two stars instead of one because of the body design. This is a smart design, because you put pressure on the front end of it where the staple is being driven instead of at the back like most other staple guns. The handle that you push on is comfortably rounded with a non-slip rubberized finish. Too bad it doesn't actually drive staples well.",0,0,0,0

R36JT55Y0U7TIO,"Update #3 (still day 2) as I’m boxing it up to go back, I just noticed that it has stopped.—DAY 2 UPDATE. LEAK/FOG FAILURE AFTER 1 DAY/USE — Returning to seller.Likely cause: Improper battery replacement without vacuum testing.  Please Keep in mind that these batteries last ~3 years. These watches are MUCH older stock than that and probably require a new battery if your seller notices or cares...or keeps track.  (Just now remembering that my crown DEFINITELY was pushed in and running upon delivery)If any single person tells you that it is remotely okay or acceptable for a new, quality watch to fog - whether you put ice, in the freezer, hot water - they are wrong.Changing these batteries is expensive. Make sure it is done correctly.PLEASE CHECK/ENQUIRE ABOUT STOCK &  AGE.  You don’t want a watch on month 35 nor do you want a brand new battery that was installed incorrectly that WILL result in failure....original review....NO NEW WATCH SHOULD FOG OR LEAK. PERIOD. Especially at this price point.I have a lot of watches. From real cheap Velcro to very pricy. This watch is a great size and value! Not “chunky” (I hate that phrase) but it’s not a Mickey Mouse size watch. Good for a mans wrist. I’m 5’9” 160.The tritium is barely visible in daylight but very bright in the dark. The watch is super super light. The lense is awesome. Sapphire crystal ...so u can’t really go wrong - or get better.The nylon strap is super floppy soft. Don’t expect stiffness that needs breaking in, like I did. This is like backpack strapping.  I wear in shower/pool/ocean so I’ll update if any negative effectsFor $260 bucks, this is awesome.  All proper warranty PW was included. There are fakes out there.  Time will tell of course as I never take my watches off. They get a beating. (Why buy then if they collect dust).  You can easily pay $600 for this watch with a different name, same specs.I’ll update if I have any issues whatsoever including scratching etc.  I’m picky AF but this watch is a winner.

RAECANCZ2H6Y9,"I've been through this book a few times now.  I admit that Pooh seems a good Taoist, if I remember my theology classes right.  I will also go so far as to say that the book amuses from time to time.  Where the book falls short in my opinion is the narrator's tone.Mr. Hoff's contrasts between Taoist and Judeo-Christian approaches to life invariably give the air of self-satisfaction one so often finds in Western converts to Eastern religion.  It is this pall of smug (apologies to Trey Parker and Matt Stone) that makes the book progressively more annoying as the pages turn.I'd give it 3 or 4 stars for accuracy and explanation, were it not for the tone.",0,0,0,0
RSTV0VKCQ8TOE,"The thermostat has never worked. For the past year and a half, it's run 100-150 degrees low. Suddenly, a couple of weeks ago, the thermostat seems to be completely shot. It just gets hotter and hotter; the elements (top and bottom) never shut off, so everything is burned before it's cooked.Too late to send it back, but I won't be buying another one of this brand.Previous review:With just the two of us to cook for, a countertop oven is more energy efficient than heating up the a large oven just to bake two potatoes and roast a dozen spears of asparagus. And for the money, this one does the job. However, determining how long something will take to cook is a guessing game. The gauge seems to be correct at the lower temperatures, but the oven never seems to get much over 350, using an oven thermometer. I pretty much just leave it set at 450 (which will eventually get up to 350) and check every so often; otherwise, it can literally take four or five times as long to cook as expected. It says it will hold a 13-inch pan, but not if it has handles on it; 13 inches total is the maximum, so measure your pans. The picture shows two pizzas in the oven, but even with the convection on, the one on the bottom will not cook in the same time as the one on the top. I've never used the rotisserie, as it says it will take 4 hours to cook a chicken.",0,0,0,0

R2HLE2IDRZNKDK,"As other reviewer noted, the instruction manual was a joke.  It had 6 ""simple"" steps that required 100 guesses to get things right.  A great example is when you start out with step number 1, it states 3 different screw sizes are required (all of which fit in all 3 holes) and you get to figure out which one goes where based on analysis of future steps.  It also has you build the thing upside down in the instructions, which makes the instruction easy, but is not practical when you realize you build the little shelf part first and are supposed to somehow build the desk with that on the bottom.  Anyway, finally got it all together and it looks great.  I went to move it into the corner of the room and one of the leg connectors broke.  I can't imagine taking apart and returning so I'm just going to be very careful with it.

First of all, let me say I agree with the reviewer who said you should encourage your kids to read whatever the book is (within reason of course--no 5 year old needs to be reading the ""Anarchist's Cookbook"").That being said, I think you could do a lot better than ""Eragon"" in choosing a book for the young fantasy fan in your life. I've worked in publishing for about 15 years, and this book would never have made it out of the slush pile at the company I worked for. Mr. Paolini is simply not a very good writer, and his style is a poor example for children. The story is indeed as derivative as all of the reviewers who actually put some thought into their reasing have stated, and hisp ortrayl of females is downright non-existant (I'm sure a product of Mr. Paolini's own lack of familiarity with this subject at the time of his writing--he was an adolescent after all).I wouldn't recommend this book to any young person I know, or to any parent. This is the muzak version of a Beatles tune, or the Sci-Fi Channel version of Frank Herbert's books. Nice try---but it doesn't cut the mustard. Perhaps Mr. Paolini should find a new career.

Therefore, the stool can completely come apart under weight - and will collapse if you are sitting, or, heaven forbid, standing on it when this happens - very dangerous!  Also, the ""non-skid"" foam dots on the top surface are not especially effective because they are recessed slightly, so although they might provide some slip protection, this would only work if they were exposed so they would make contact with whatever is on top of the stool.

R2S08E1BXYDKZF,"I would completely agree with Publishers Weekly review of this ""facile piece of pop sociology"".  It's the sort of rubbish that poisons the minds of managers and raises unrealistic expectations.At the heart of the book is a dangerous illusion, that changes happen rapidly in business, especially in the area of innovation.  Yet empirical study after empirical study shows otherwise.  Adoption curve analysis of empirical data about innovations such as Broadband, the Internet, mobile phones, portable MP3 players, fax machines etc. show that the half-life penetration period for all these technologies is 5-10 years.  Innovation is adopted slowly, always has been, and empirical evidence does not support the view that this is in any way accelerating.The dotcom bubble was inflated by wild ideas about rapid adoption of innovation.  Gladwell should pay heed to the lessons from this before raising the expectations of gullible managers about ""tipping points"".This isn't to say that tipping points don't exist - a quick tour of the literature of catastrophe theory shows this - prison riots etc. all conform to tipping point behaviour.  But tipping points are generally at the microscopic level, and macro instances are confined to stock markets not consumer markets.What explains this book's popularity then, if it's so flawed?  Well it's written by a staff writer of the New Yorker, collating articles that were written to amuse and titillate readers.  The articles are laced with amusing snippets, and the author hops from snippet to snippet without pausing for thought.His trendy piffle is overinflated, vacuous and dangerous.

R2ESUZ39TAFAQ7,"When I see a book published in 2004 has 47% bad reviews, I know I need to look back further for my last Cornwell read.Thank you all for the honest reviews and for the warnings. It's been quite a while since I read a Scarpetta novel and enjoyed it. Characters lovingly developed over the course of the first books devolved into truly unlikable people. I couldn't stand to watch their decline anymore, and given the horrific crimes dealt with, it's too much to wade through without likeable characters to hold your hand and guide you to the end.I wait for reviews and check in hoping to see someone trumpet that the old Scarpetta is back. Hasn't happened yet and I've pretty much given up hope.",0,0,0,0
R3CRDUZO51XNET,"I had written a 5 star raving review... but here's my update....after having this long enough that I cannot return, I have to say this is the BUGGIEST firmware / software printer. I have updated everything, but half way through, it hangs up and I have to cancel and start again. it thinks WAY too much to print a page, but when printing b/w it's blazing fast AFTER it thinks a long time.color... SLOOOOOWWWWWW to a point of pain.DO NOT BUY rating from meoriginal;;;This is a FAST printer. The paper is delivered sideways, which is new to me. There is a handy touchscreen. It was found by my win10 automatically as soon as I connected it to my wifi.The print quality is great. Also this has a paper input in the back as well, so if you're going to put paper in manually, like thick paper, make sure you have room in the back of the printer to open the tray.",0,0,0,0
R23R2O53OOO94G,"We purchased a number of these 20 pack Assorted Color Plastic Clothes Pins in May of 2014.  Within 4 months, over 90% of these clothes pins cracked and fell to the ground.  I purchased these clothes pins after reading all the glowing reviews.  Not sure how or why, but the large majority of these clothes pins cracked and became utterly useless within 4 months.We have chosen to go back to the reliable wood clothes pins.  These plastic clothes pins are easily destroyed by the sun's UV rays.  We usually average about 3-5 years of usage with the wooden clothes pins.

R1HPRL2ARAZ1TT,"Update after 2 months:  The black is awful too. Changing rating to 1 star. Printing gray boxes/shading if splotchy and inconsistent.  Text is over-saturated like it soaks into the paper too much. This is unbearable and unusable professionally. DO NOT BUY THIS INK!  It is not worth the savings.  I've given up and ordered HP brand ink. It always worked very well, just is very expensive.------The black text seems to be ok, but the colors are horrible. Even ""gray"" highlighting is switched to blurbs of colors.  The colors are inaccurate unless I print on the highest/slowest print quality (using the most ink).  Anything less in quality an I get variations in darkness and totally inaccurate colors (i.e. red instead of gray, blue instead of red).  I will definitely NOT buy this again and cannot recommend it.  I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 simply because it was cheap so if you just want black only text with no gray, it is probably sufficient.",0,0,0,0

R6YKPKLZG0NYB,"This is TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE ink!!!  Yes, physically the cartridge fits in my Canon printer -- BUT -- it is terrible quality ink, and it smears EXTREMELY easy.Note that this problem persists (apparently) forever -- even weeks after I print a document, it readily smears if I make the mistake of touching it!!!  (See attached image, which I printed 2-3 weeks ago, but which readily smeared today!!!)This makes it entirely unsuitable for my purposes.  When using original Canon ink, I have never had any such problems.  This was my first try at using off-brand ink -- and clearly I'll go back to using Canon ink (and suffer the high price).===========UPDATE ON 3/27/19:  The customer support team sent me a set of replacement ink cartridges, so I'll add a star for the good customer service.  Once I try the ink again I will update my review accordingly (first I need to use up the Canon ink that I purchased after I discarded the Smart Ink cartridges).",0,0,0,0
R1AFL7FPOHTS1M,"I would give zero stars if I could.The first one lasted about 4 months, printed great, then a black line started appearing when I printed.  I lived with that a couple of weeks and then it started to print with blank streaks in the black ink areas.  I thought it was the ink cartridge.  I cleaned the printer heads, without success.  I bought new ink cartridges.  It was not the ink.  Amazon was great about sending a replacement.Now the replacement, after about 1 month, had a paper jam.  I cleared the paper, however, the error message remains after several attempts to go through all the places to clear and turn off turn on.  I took out the paper whole with no torn off parts to be stuck in the rollers.  Amazon is sending out another replacement.I have never had such problems with Epson in the past. Matter of fact I went back to Epson after an HP which I had over a year broke off a very tiny plastic part which kept it from printing.  I thought that was poorly designed.  If the third Epson craps out I will try Canon.Frustrated with poor quality workmanship.  At this price point, these printers are disposable items, filling our recycle bins and landfills.  Not sure how much more to spend to get better quality or if that would guarantee quality.  The ink cost is high no matter what. Buying a repair warranty?  I don't want to spend down time with repairs on something that should last a much longer and give a lot better service. Not made in USA...

The studios must be stopped from making these multiple versions of their movies on DVDs.Backbeat is released by the studio with only a 2.0 track on it then released later in 5.1. Fear & Loathing in Las Vegas was giving similar treatment.If you have a home theatre system then you have even less reason to buy this extended edition. Where do the studios get off releasing a movie with a DTS track on it then releasing a longer version missing the DTS track? They tried to do this with The Bourne Identity. Guess which one I'm keeping? That's right, the DTS version. Gladiator has one of the best DTS tracks ever on it, everything is so clear and perfectly balanced. I'm sick of the way the studios keep screwing over the public by not releasing the ""Special"" edition as the normal edition.Gladiator DTS:ES 6.1 is the only version of this movie that should be released. Help teach the studios that they can't screw us around like this.EDIT - JAN 2011 - The newly re-mastered Blu-ray version is of course the version you should be buying, complete with both versions of the film and a lossless high resolution soundtrack.

Many scene's use of cuss words were just weird...even the people the characters were trying to be like don't talk that way.  It just tried too hard and only sometimes was funny.

R1XKL0CDCXBFIS,"I've tried all different brands and sizes of scissors, and carefully followed the extremely easy and simple instructions, and it won't sharpen any of them. And worse (I guess?), if you're not careful when you're pulling your scissors out, you'll cut and damage the cheap plastic on either side of the sharpening area essentially slowly cutting the device in half. I wasn't expecting military-grade for the price but I at least expected it to do the simple task it is advertised as doing. I dislike giving negative reviews and less than 4 or 5 stars, but I've been having a terrible run with products purchased through Amazon lately. Perhaps Amazon should practice a little more quality control with the vendors they allow to sell through their good name and the products those vendors sell. Maybe it's just a Winter curse and things will go back to the old, reliable Amazon that I've relied on and loved for 15+ years. I really wish this device would work for me in some capacity and would sharpen, well, anything, so I could give it 2 or 3 stars; it is what it is though, unfortunately. About the only positive things I have to say, besides the instructions being simple (although to a futile end), is that it was shipped to me quickly and packaged as expected. I don't have any reason to think that the seller was trying to be dishonest or fraudulent, just that an item they sell doesn't work for me. If anyone has any tips or ideas that would help me, although the instructions are foolproof enough, I would love to be proven totally wrong.

R3GN62RQR1FMZR,"The Star Wars novles was always in danger of being lost and out of focus like the Star trek novels, just continuing for their own sake.The original EU novels spoke of a huge open universe filled with possibilities. For each novel new worlds would be created, new characters written about. New adventures, and lost of fun.Remember that Star Wars EU, FUN????Rogue squandron, Thrawn Trilogy, Tales of Star Wars FUN??The New Jedi order was a risky gamble, and I think it paid off. There were lots of new characters, space battles and a lessening of the pressure on the original cast of characters as they were all getting older. Also it allowed some of the planets from earliers in the series to be revisited with a different content.Then swarm wars books were just filler.And eveything since this book has been terrible. Its like the book was written for people who hadn't read the previous one's. Some characters are acting completely differently for no reason. And everything is dark. Which is where the Star Trek movies got stuck, trying to make everything dark rather then fun.The publishers also show they care nothing for quality, the last novel in this series was a joke.Also, I remeber when, if a star wars book was a HARDBACK, then you were in for a brilliant story.Have you seen the trash that they release in hardback now, the Star Wars Siege books were woeful!!--SPOILER ALERTReally the Fate of the Jedi series was written like the authors involved weren't even talking to each other.Jacen turns to the dark side because he see's a vision where Luke Skywalker, a man who lived a rich full life into his now fifties, will die.Presumable he turns to the dark side to avoid this future, so to save lukes life he: - Kills his wife. - Tries to kill him and everyone he knows. - Successfully kills millions of people.And who should kill him, why his SISTER of course, even though if this book was written 10 years ago she would be the LAST person to be put in that position.Then in the legacy series the publishers realised they messed up and tried to Jacen's out of character behaviour, and fail miserably.Legacy brings us back to previous locations, trying to show us why the Star Wars EU was so good in the first place, and makes them boring.I bought ALL the star wars book, I have easily over 200.

This is now what i may consider my benchmark for what a bad film is. Everything about the plot, and especially the acting is absolutely absurd.  Never have i seen this much melodrama in one movie. The characters are breathtakingly stupid and annoying. I hated this movie, and felt i had wasted my evening, how this script made it to the theaters is beyond me, the only rational reason is that it was simply a star vehicle. And, yes, these are actually all great actresses and actors, but in this hour and a half they show nothing of their abilities. For anyone thinking of watching this, i say HARD PASS.

R3Y8C7W272Y4A,"Was so excited to receive this beautiful desk. Shipped quick & packaged well. It's downhill from there. Instructions were vague. Spent 5 hrs with my husband attempting to out this together.  We are quite experienced with putting furniture  together. The holes were not propped drilled (too shallow) & hopes did not line up on 1st 6 pieces we tried to assemble. We had to redrill 8 holes on the CPU cabinet alone. It became increasingly evident we would have to redrill nearly every hole single because they were all off ~.25"" throughout.  At this point we were still not finished with Step 2. We finally decided this was not worth this level of work.  We lacked confidence in the stability of the finished product with the need to do all these workarounds. I am extremely disappointed. At the very least, I expected to have all the holes lined up & drilled properly after spending $470. We packed everything up for return.  After reading the reviews, seems others had similar problems.

She doesn't even act like a stoner acts. First of all, people who are stoned don't spend the entire high with their mouths open. Second of all, people who are stoned are usually so paranoid, they wouldn't even think to try to sell weed to a stranger right off the cuff. Thirdly, people who are stoned don't stagger around like they are alcoholic drunks.

It's supposed to take place where Ian Fleming's series leaves off, yet there is no continuity at all. In this book, Bond speaks like a robot and he doesn't even feel like Bond anymore when you read his dialogue and actions. You can also tell Sebastian Faulks copied other Bond stories. For example, the main villian: Dr. Julius Gorner (Hello, Dr. Julius No anybody!)meets Bond socially at his ""usual tennis court"" to cheat, and he has a sidekick (Goldfinger and Oddjob copy). Bond walks into situations as if he's a rookie or hyped up on anti-depressants, and in this book he's too stupid to do any thinking on his own. Sebastian Faulks made him care more about vanity and cigarettes and drinks as opposed to the mission or the action. I don't think I need to go any further, true Bond fans understand.

R13YV8GI49OJDW,"With all due respect to Dr. Joy, this book is of limited use to men. Many of the reviews have observed this book to represent a female perpective. I am a middle-aged man, and in my experience, there really is no such thing as THE female perspective. In fact, there are three: the perspective of an attractive woman, that of an average woman, and that of an unattractive woman. Trust me, these are three distinctly different perspectives, and one approach does NOT fit all.An attractive woman is in demand and is approached all the time. She lives in a reality in which she has many options, often more than she can handle. She can therefore afford to be selective to an extent that less attractive women would consider impractical. Such a woman could not care less whether a man is on his best behavior, or if he has taken the time to plan out a date, brush his teeth, or other such mundane and pedestrian considerations. She brings high romantic and erotic expectations into relationships, which is why she would never develop such an interest in a man who is merely a friend. She settles only for a guy who has Brad Pitt's looks or Donald Trump's success or uncommon inner masculine qualities of supreme confidence - bordering on arrogance, dominance, boldness, adventurousness, etc. In short, she demands and gets what other women only fantasize about.Unattractive women have no options. Many of them live in denial until reality catches up with them, typically in their 30s. They eventually learn that being selective is not something that was meant for them. As such, they consider themselves lucky to get any expression of interest, and the rules of the game articulated in Dr. Joy's book do not apply to them. With them, no rule is needed.The only women to whom this book applies are the average ones -- those who are neither attractive nor repulsive. These are the women who have adjusted their expectations so they can be selective within their own compromised realms. Rules and expectations give them a sense of control and sovereignty which becomes an acceptable substitute for facing the reality that they will never have what they truly desire. Dr. Joy herself is likely one such woman, and she has been gracious enough to share her perspective in great detail in her book. However, my advice to any man considering reading the book is this: If you are interested in dating average women, this book should be your bible. If not, save your time and money.",0,0,0,0
R19HWOK3IGK7R3,"Short reviewMy problem with this book is exactly what some of the other reviews have said: Wilson seems to want to write a book that is about his characters, not his science, but his characters are one dimensional and so too often he falls back on telling us things instead of showing them in the character's actions. I don't actually think it's a terrible book, and I found it slightly entertaining, but I spent much of it frustrated by its flaws and confused as to how it got a Hugo. In the end, there are a lot of other, much better, science fiction books out there which do basically the same thing much better.Long explanationThe science has been explained in other reviews, and I actually found it to be the biggest strength of the book. I thought the build up was perhaps a little long, but I found the conclusion relatively interesting and satisfying (if a little pulled out of the hat). The earth is suddenly surrounded one day by some kind of membrane which filters out sunlight, moonlight, and starlight, while sustaining life on Earth with a faux sun (I call it a membrane because it DOES allow human made objects through). Even more baffling to the characters, this membrane seems to keep Earth in a time bubble, allowing the rest of the universe to go by 100 million times faster. This membrane is called the Spin, and the book focuses on how people react to it.The protagonist is Tyler Dupree, who starts the book out as 12 and grows up to become a doctor. His father, we are told, died in a car accident when he was younger, and his mother took on a job ""managing the household"" of the Lawtons, a couple that are old friends from college. It's not clear to me what exactly her job is, but considering that we are told she has an MBA, and that she is frustrated with this job, it never is quite clear to me why she agreed to do it. This is especially confusing since it is describes as the job offer is described as ""charity"" on the part of the Lawtons. Later we are given a reason why the Lawtons would want her around, but never a particularly compelling reason for why she would want to stay.The Lawton's have two children of their own, a pair of twins named Jason and Diane. We are told that they are both very brilliant, although this is only supported in Jason's case, who spends most of the book technobabbling at Tyler, but never really is given much of a personality other than curiosity and drive. Diane on the other hand, spends most of the book in a religious cult, something that is ""explained"" as her fear of the Spin. While we are told that ""her IQ was nearly as impressive as Jason's"" we are never given any kind of evidence as to this. (That's not to say religious folks can't be intelligent, but she spends her time in a cult, married to a fanatic who seems to make all of her life's decisions for her.)Of course, Tyler is in love with Diane, which seems to be at times the entire point of her character. We are again told that the reason Tyler loves her is because she is so caring and loving (shown by the fact that she was sad when her pet dog died?). But I never really bought it. That is, I bought that a twelve year old boy could have a crush on his thirteen year old neighbor. I never really bought that Tyler spends the next thirty years still in love with her and unable to really move on. Although, it's not that he doesn't have relationships with other women, mostly so they can be curious about Diane and Jason, ask Tyler nosy questions and let him tell us some more how in love with them he is. We are told about several women who drop by for a few pages, sleep with him, and fail to have any kind of impact on Tyler. Even the woman he was ""almost engaged to"" is brought up once as comparison to Diane's fiance, and then NEVER mentioned again. It's as if he were the one stuck in a time bubble. That's not to mention the ""young, carefree"" prostitute-neighbor who sleeps with him (out of pity, he suspects), and like many of his paramours, tells him that he sure is obsessed with those Lawton folks. And then is never seen again. The most fleshed out of his girlfriends is his secretary/nurse, who apparently had a crush on him for five years until asking him out? Because his character is sooooo dreamy? She acts suspiciously, he notices but doesn't suspect anything, and is super surprised when she sells him out (yelling angrily as she leaves ""I f___ed you because I was lonely""). I almost feel like Wilson should be writing for Daytime television.Even without all of the issues with characterization, his writing is sometimes chunky and confusion with random phrases which seem to have been inserted because he liked the way they sound. Some of my favorites:p 62 ""My mom had been a news junkie... watching CNN not for pleasure or even information but mainly to reassure herself, the way a Mexican villager might keep an eye on a nearby volcano, hoping not to see smoke."" - I'm confused as to why a white Canadian-American writer thinks that his primarily white, primarily American audience would find this comparison illuminating, and why he thinks he knows so much about the actions of Mexican villagers to begin withp 68 ""The lawn glowed like a mathematician's idea of a garden, the cultivation of a primary color."" - I'm a mathematician and I have NO IDEA what this meansp 268 ""If reasonably was a knife, I'd be losing blood.""",0,0,0,0

RBUF1YRFR9SWC,"I must admit I've never seen `Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle'.  Because of it's cult classic status, I have some real regrets.  Except as I go into `Harold and Kumar Escape from Guantanomo Bay,' I can at least evaluate this movie without being biased by the former film.I found this sequel to be repulsive, so I'll try to be as brief as possible.  I first want to say that I've seen, reviewed, and/or recommended `Superbad,' ' The Road to Guantanamo ,' and ` The Prisoner or: How I Planned to Kill Tony Blair '.  I've also highly recommended ` A Mighty Heart ,' ` The War Tapes ,' and ` Operation Homecoming - Writing the Wartime Experience ,' so it doesn't matter what political spectrum the movie plays.  If it's a good movie, it's a good movie.Plot:  Harold (John Cho) and Kumar (Kal Penn) go to Amsterdam while lusting for two beauties:  Vanessa (Danneel Harris), a college sweetheart with whom Kal split two years earlier, and Maria (Paula Garcés), Harold's model interest.  On the plane, Kumar, who can't wait to get to where the grass is green and flowing, lights a ""smokeless"" bong to share with Harold in the airplane bathroom.  When caught, ""racial profiling"" makes the people on the flight panic, thinking the bong is a bomb.  Diverted back to the U.S., both face imprisonment at Guantanamo Bay.  From there they escape and episodically travel from Miami to Texas hoping to stop Vanessa from making her vows to pure-bred overbearing bore, Colton (Eric Winter).Execution:  As original as ` Borat - Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan (Full Screen Edition) ' was, `...Escape from Guantanamo Bay' is a slap-in-the-face imitation, a stoner road movie without all the impromptu filming of real people.A conservative objection:  This is all blather, tongue-in-cheek anger dressed up as comedy.A liberal objection:  ""Imagine"" a 1:40 comedy with Archie Bunker (Home Security Agent Fox [Rob Corddry]) yelling most of the time with very few funny jokes.  This is deadly for our issues.  Al Franken didn't become a #1 best-selling author for nothing!A humorist objection:  If 80% of your material is angry sarcasm, can it still be funny?Example:  Agent Fox uses the Fifth Amendment as toilet paper.  Wha Ha Ha!  (Yes, this movie's a satire.)Redeeming Traits:  There's a funny scene where a woman on the airplane distorts seeing Kumar as an Arab jihadist.  There's another funny scene after they condemn the Ku Klux Klan as ""racist dogs,"" we see a Spuds MacKenzie look-alike in a white hood.  The themes are laudable.  ""Racial profiling"" is not acceptable.  There are tender moments, but while they're more sincere than `Shallow Hal,' they're also about as exceptional.Trying to be consistent, I must say the timing of `Harold and Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay' is measurably better than `Meet the Spartans,' but at least that parody rendered a few more laughs.A J.P.'s Pan 1.5 *'s=Poor-Mediocre(*Sorry for the `Bullwinkle' inspired title.

R2FA4EKQ2J3NI4,"I bought this handheld (the Palm T|X) on July 25, 2006.  At the time of this review, that is less than 90 days.I am about to give an honest opinion and warning to anyone who wants to buy this.  I have had a miserable experience from all angles.  Usage and support from palm has been a disaster.The handheld was technically working when I got it from Amazon.  I was able to load my calendar and contacts in from Outlook.  However, the web ability is terrible and the ability to gain an IP address dynamically is very poor.  (Don't just trust my experience, search that on the web and you will find multiple issues.)  So, I had to hard code an IP every time I wanted online.However, things soon got much worse.  The palm pilot one night, just froze, and then started rebooting itself continuously.  I couldn't even turn it off.  Just reboot-reboot-reboot.  It finally wore out of batteries (overnight.)  Low battery life is another complaint, but one that pales in comparison to the others.So, I call Palm for support.  On hold for 45 minutes.  Line gets cut.  I call back and get a rep.  After giving her the serial number, line gets cut again.  To her credit, she called me back and said that they have numerous problems with their phone system.  The whole call she could barely hear me, and I had to repeat information over and over.The only advice she had was that we wipe the handheld clean, erasing all information.  While that might work, this is less than 90 days old, and is a complete piece of junk.  I wanted a refund (honestly, I know they can do it.)  They refuse to refund any money, they refuse to exchange for a new identical model.  They will only erase, and hope that it doesn't happen again, although they give no reason that it might have happened in the first place.Again, don't just take my word.  Search online for the Palm T|X rebooting infinitely.  It is a common problem.  If you buy this, make sure you back up everything everyday, and just get ready to erase and reload the handheld often.Please save yourself the $200-300 that you'd spend on this and search out another company doing a similar thing.  You'll be much happier.",0,0,0,0
R3DJ4BKY6ZXJJ4,"Ok, I'm not quick to jump on the bandwagon for anything; which is why after hearing of the criticism of Eragon, I still decided to give it a go. However, the simillarities between this book and the first ""Star Wars"" film were so blatantly obvious, it was hard to come to any other conclusion, other than that Christopher Paolini has realised that, with a little plagiarism, he can cash in on the market with no real thought or imagination required.So, if no one has noticed the quite unmissable simillarities between Star Wars and Eragon, I thought I'd spell a few out for you. Eragon is a simple farm boy, living in a remote village with his uncle (Wait, didn't luke skywalker do that?). There is a cruel empire that Luke, OOOPS, Eragon and his people dispise (Same in Star Wars, wasn't it?). Then, a curious old man arrives on the scene, and teaches Eragon all kinds of secrets that will help conquer the empire (Okay, in star wars it was about Jedi forces, in this it was about dragons, but the same idea, right?). When Eragon discovers a dragon in his village, the empire are quick to react, and one day whan Eragon is away with his dragon, he finds that the empire have murdered his uncle (Same in star wars, was it not?). Seeing that he has nothing left to stay for, Eragon and his dragon go on a magical journey with the curious old man to defeat the empire. 'Nough said.So, no original story line; in regards to other issues, the book is very well written, with some quite momorable dialogue (EG ""The mind is man's last sanctuary."") Character development is existant as well, although the bond between Eragon and Brom (old man) is all to familiar if you've heard of Frodo and Gandalf. The Dragon, Saphire is a very likeable character, and she is described in a way that makes her quite believable. But for me, there are too many cliches in this book to keep me entertained; if you are looking for effective teen fantasy with a deep meaning, I would reccomend David Clements Davies's ""The Sight"". While this book may keep young children entertained with large monsters and action packed battles, a reader of fantasy and Sci Fi greats will, after Fifty pages, have ""I've heard all this before"" ringing in their heads for the remainder of the book.",0,0,0,0

Did anyone care about the capture of the so-called villain?  No.  Was the villain even remotely fascinating? No.  Were any of the characters?  Again, no.I would prefer to see Holmes and Watson on holiday somewhere along with nine or ten other people in a far away location, where, coincidentally! a murder occurs which only he can solve--formulaic, sure, but, you see, it works, such a storyline can be diversified and differentiated.... Ironically, Downey plays a pretty good Holmes, if only the storyline was great he could truly shine.  I can watch the film ""Evil Under the Sun"" time and again, because its compelling, it possesses all of the elements necessary to exalt it, yet the Holmes sequel was dull, contrived, predictable, silly, unmysterious...a failure.

Had I of written a review before he actually used the items, I probably would have given them 4.5-5 stars considering all he got for such a reasonable price. However, he has attempted to use the compass’ a week now, and they are all worthless.. they all have the issue of not locking into position, so when you go to measure an angle and then move the compass to duplicate the angle, it’s not in the same position. This has caused major frustration. Also, on 2 of the compass’, the point where the 2 legs connect is very weak, it moves about oddly, if you open the legs you can see the broken plastic piece that is supposed to make it open evenly. This is with minimal use and me in the same room as my 8th grader (no siblings) so I know they haven’t been abused. The plastic protractor is ok. It did fall in my wooden floor and the center pivoting bar broke off, but my son was able to snap that into place, so we were happy about that.

Emperor Padisha Shaddam IV (Jose Ferrer) rules the galactic empire sends out Duke Leto Artedis (Jurgen Prochnow), wife Lady Jessica (Fracesca Annis) and son Paul (Kyle MacLachan) to Arrakis where they must take charge of the spice business. however the overweight floating villain known as Baron Vladmire Harkonnen (Kenneth Mcmillian) wants control of the spice as well for evil purposes but when Paul and his mother are sent to the dangerous deserts where giant man-eating sandworms prowl, they discover an underground colony of people called Fremen and Paul finds true love with a native named Chano (Sean Young). Later he will become a powerful messiah of great powers called Maud'dib of the Fremen as he will lead an army to stop the manufactoring of the spice.A disappointing and quite bad Sci-fi fantasy movie that is quite a loose adaptation of Frank Herbert's timeless Sci-fi/fantasy novel classic. It took 20 years to get the book to the big screen until Dino De Laurentiis studios got the rights as originally Alejandro Jorodowsky or Ridley Scott was set to direct but went on to do Blade Runner instead so they got David Lynch who wrote and direct the movie. Some of the casting isn't too bad as it includes Sian Philips, Dean Stockwell, Paul Smith, Brad Douriff, Sting (Kind of weak at acting), Freddie Jones, Linda Hunt, Max Von Sydow and Patrick Stewart as Gurnie as the other cast members but Mclachen was a good casting choice for Paul. The special effects are very good for it's time even if some look cheap and the music score by Brain Eno & Toto is good but this adaptation is very muddled and not very satisfying for fans of the novel but it's still very entertaining and as bad as you heard from critics and audiences over the years but still disappointing even with some disgusting stuff shown by the director who aren't in the book.This 2-Disc DVD set contains a nice tin collectable packaging with both the extended version which is longer and of course the theatrical edition as it has some cool extras like photo galleries, featurettes and deleted scenes.Also recommended: ""Dune (2000)"", ""Children of Dune"", ""The Fifth Element"", ""Avatar"", ""Heavy Metal"", ""Stargate"", ""Total Recall"", ""Armageddon"", ""Blade Runner"", ""Serenity"", ""Children of Men"", ""12 Monkeys"", ""Metropolis (1927)"", ""Nausicca: Valley of the Winds"", ""Dark City"", ""The Dark Crystal"", ""Star Wars Saga"", ""Star Trek Movies"", ""Flash Gordon"", ""Barbarella"", ""The Black Hole"", ""2001 A Space Odyssey"", ""2010"", ""Excalibur"", ""Planet of the Apes (1968) with sequels and remake"" and ""The Matrix Trilogy"".",0,0,0,0

I have run, crisp, clear, wrinkle-free receipts through this repeatedly after calibration and tried every possible setting before hand in hopes of a better scan with no luck. This is a piece of junk and I've never been sorrier to buy a product. The IRS would never accept these receipt ""scans"" (and I use the term loosely) as documented proof of expenses. Meanwhile, I spent the same amount of time the following day (that I did the day I set it up and tried to resolve the scan quality issue) entering 6 months of receipts by hand in a simple profit and loss spread sheet I customized in Excel and hand enter my purchases, keeping the hard receipts for my backup. This ultimately ended up being faster, easier and cheaper. Don't waste your time, desk space or money.",0,0,0,0

But... others really put me off, and the slow story development did not increase my enjoyment.Mild spoiler here.  I like the concept of sentient robots obsessing over human culture as a way to humanize them, but Simmons went too deep with it.  Having the moravacs spend so much time talking about classic literature did not make them more ""human"" to me.  In fact, it did the opposite.  Humans, even those who are obsessed with a topic, do not go into this level of depth on it.  If Dan Simmons wanted to demonstrate he is a scholar of classical literature, how about writing a book focused on that, and not trying to cram it down the throats of his Sci-fi audience.The other human characters are not much better.  Seriously, it took about 80% of the book before one stopped talking about how much he wanted to sleep with his cousin.  The list goes on.I see this as an opportunity squandered.  This could have been a fantastic book about how in the future a re-creation of the Trojan war turned out different, but Dan Simmons tried to turn it into an epic saga.

This book is written in a somewhat daunting style, replete with advanced vocabulary, metaphors, similes, and personifications.  Those are poetic techniques, and I found it necessary to slow my reading in response to them.  Although I had a grade of B in writing poetry (neither poor nor great) at the University of Michigan, I seldom read poetry, because I usually neither understand nor enjoy it.

The internal diameter of the new ones is 30mm, as compared to the 26mm diameter of my old ones (from a different company), measured with my caliper.These would be fine if they were the correct size, but they aren't, and it seems like it's not a mix-up of sending the wrong one since the sticker indicates they should be 26mm. The only saving grace is that they were only $7, but that's still $7 wasted unless I find something that's about 30mm to use them with.

RP8YJY63XJHVB,"""Hello. My name is Violet and I was born into a world you may not understand.""  That's the first line of dialog heard from the film Ultraviolet (2006)...after watching the movie last night, I think the following would have been more appropriate...""Hello. My name is Violet and I was born into a movie you may not understand (or even like).""  Written and directed by Kurt Wimmer (Sphere, Equilibrium), the film stars Milla Jovovich (Dazed and Confused, The Fifth Element, Resident Evil).  Also appearing is Cameron Bright (X-Men: The Last Stand), Nick Chinlund (Con Air, The Chronicles of Riddick), Sebastien Andrieu, and William Fichtner (Heat, The Perfect Storm).As the movie, set in a messed up future (isn't that always the case?), begins we see some giant bowling balls dropped from the air into a building, and once inside the balls turn into deadly assassins...well, that's a pretty neat trick...anyway, some stuff happens, which leads into a lengthy flashback with voiceover by Jovovich.  Apparently, some time ago, a nasty virus was found in Eastern Europe, one which Western powers tried to modify in order to create super soldiers or some such thing, but all they really ended up doing was creating a nastier form of the virus, one which gives it's victims sharper eyesight, acute hearing, enhanced strength, superior healing abilities, and vampire fangs...so what's the downside?  Well I tell you...the victims are generally sensitive to light and have an extremely shortened lifespan.  Seems those affected, known as Hemophages, were then rounded up by the norms and put into camps for experimentation, and those still on the loose formed an underground resistance movement, of which Violet (Jovovich) is a member.  All right, as the flashback/background stuff comes to a close, we find out Vice Cardinal Ferdinand Daxus (Chinlund), the egomaniacal tyrant ruler of the norms has developed a new super weapon, one that supposedly will eliminate the Hemophage threat once and for all, but Violet nicks it through a lengthy and involved series of high-octane action sequences.  As it turns out, the weapon just happens to be an idiot child named Six (Bright), whose blood, while deadly to Hemophages, may also contain a cure.  Violet soon finds herself stuck in the middle as the leader of the Hemophages, some Euro trash named Nerva (Andrieu) wants the kid dead, while the Vice Cardinal wants back what's his...what follows are numerous dead end scenes between Violet and the kid, lots of running around, some fight sequences, some back door dealing, and ultimately a final showdown as Violet battles her way through an army into the belly of the beast (the Arch Ministry building) to face off against the Vice Cardinal himself, who has some serious secrets of his own...By the end of this film I was somewhat aggravated...why?  A number of reasons, but the main one being it seemed like the story was a patchwork of ideas and concepts, none of them developed particularly well.  I did like all the action sequences up front, but once those passed, we were left with having to sit through a whole lot of rotten acting and goofy dialog, the latter being the weakest element of this film, for me, at least.  One example in particular happens after Violet liberates Six, and is on the run.  After a close encounter with armed authorities, Violet asks Six ""Are you damaged?""  Why not just ask ""Are you hurt?""...I'll tell you why...because it's the future and asking someone if they're `damaged' sounds a lot cooler than asking them if they're hurt, at least in Wimmer's mind, I think.  In my mind it just came off as idiotic...I've read the studio re-cut some of the film prior to its release, and even removed some sequences (I read the original film ran about a half hour longer).  Did this meddling hurt the movie, resulting in a less than desirable end product?  I don't think so, as the flaws seemed ingrained regardless of any tinkering (for a prime example of this go rent the theatrical and renegade DVD releases of the 1991 film Highlander II: The Quickening and tell me which is better).  I liked the exteriors, some of the special effects were pretty spiffy (some seemed ridiculously phony), and the fight sequences, for the most part, were fairly engaging, but the slower moments in the middle really caused the feature to drag out.  I found it rather annoying near the end when Violet, the one woman army, was invading the Arch Ministry building, and we'd see her come up against a whole mess of guards, only to cut to a scene with her coming through a door, and beyond the door we see the guards from the previous scene lying dead.  I did learn a lot from this film, including the following...1. Milla Jovovich sure likes to show off her midriff (and I like to see it).2. Body armor in the future is pretty ineffectual given it's tendency to shatter like glass when struck.3. Germophobia runs wild in the future, to the extent of affecting fashions as people don designer air masks and surgical gowns.4. In the future you'll be able to carry small to medium sized children around inside fancy, fashionable briefcases that double as backpacks.5. Uzis fitted with blades that stick out from the bottom seems like overkill (and kinda dumb).6. Extremely long hair can be detrimental to its owner during hand-to-hand combat.7. The biohazard symbol seems an awkward and impractical design for a building.8. In the future most all interiors will be designed to look like bad discothèques.9. Milla Jovovich's character seems the only one who actually knows how to fight.10. Milla Jovovich's character can literally pull futuristic gizmos and weaponry out of her ash.11. Sword usage returns to fashion in the future.12. What's the only thing cooler than a sword fight sequence?  A flaming sword fight sequence!All in al the film is very slick, stylish, and colorful, laden with a good deal of flashy action sequences (wire work galore) and special effects, but hamstrung by poor performances, terrible dialog, and not a lot of substance.  By the way, I've got the `Unrated, Extended' version, which runs about six minutes longer than the theatrical release, but I seriously doubt anyone who only saw the original release is missing much as I doubt those six minutes included anything critical or even worthwhile to the actual film.  More or less labeling this the `Unrated, Extended' version was just an attempt by the studio to breathe new life in the aftermarket into a film that died in the box office.The picture, presented in anamorphic widescreen (1.85:1), looks very sharp and the Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround audio comes through fine.  Skimpy extras include an uninteresting commentary track with Milla Jovovich by herself (where the heck is Wimmer?), a featurette titled UV Protection: The Making of Ultraviolet, and English subtitles.  Also thrown in are previews for other Sony DVD release including Final Fantasy: Advent Children (2005), Mirrormask (2005), Marilyn Hotchkiss Ballroom Dancing & Charm School (2005), The Fog (2005), The Benchwarmers (2006), and Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby (2006).Cookieman108",0,0,0,0

R2P1BNYHXEJFKP,"I'm glad I checked this book out of the library; if I'd paid actual money for it, I'd be livid right now.  After reading the synopsis and reviews, I had the impression this book would be similar in tone to Terry Pratchett's ""Discworld"" novels - satirical, sarcastic, and most of all, funny.Well, ""funny"" never made an appearance in this book.  Not once.  In fact, watching Fforde desperately rework fairy tale and nursery rhyme characters over for his own purposes ended up being, frankly, painful.  It was like reading an extremely long, extremely un-funny pun.  It was also somewhat ironic that a man who thinks fanfiction is copying and copying is bad, wrong and pathetic doesn't appear capable of creating his own characters, but only ripping off pre-existing ones.The only thing this book has to recommend it is the murder mystery, which actually was somewhat interesting, if unnecessarily convoluted and somewhat buried under the repeated, sad attempts at jokes.In short, pass on this book and pass on Fforde.",0,0,0,0

I'll give it 2 stars because build quality was great as I've come to expect from this brand.The issue is the product design itself.

By being both much narrower than the whole plate footprint, and rounded, my boxes kept wanting to slide off and fall off both sides of the plate.

As I read the reviews for this book, I'm wondering if I read the same story everyone else did.Ms. Lane has a huge following. Her name is often mentioned when readers are seeking a juicy M/M read. I was ready to jump aboard the fangirl train.  Based on the synopsis alone, The Locker Room had everything I adore in my M/M reads: A GFY (gay for you) (which is really bisexual) premise, a friends to lovers trope, and the progression of young love into adulthood. I was ready to love the heck out of this story! I was excited to give Ms. Lane's work a whirl.We meet Xander and Christian when they're teenagers. Xander is a kid with a deadbeat mom who loves the game of basketball, Chris, who has the perfect family and home life, also loves basketball.The two meet one night at the local court shooting hoops, and of course, they bond. Chris realizes Xander's hiding a secret about his home life, cue the perfect family and new buddy to the rescue.Let me say, the premise isn't awful. The premise has a heap of promise. What made me rate this book two stars? The way in which it's written. I'm not fond of Ms. Lane's writing style. Her writing isn't bad, but I didn't enjoy her story telling technique. Also, the narrative didn't flow for me, and I felt no connection to the characters at all despite all the trials and tribulations Xander and Christian endured. I kept reading hoping the story would become better but by 73%; I gave up hope.We all read a story differently, but I'm certainly staring at my Kindle with skepticism, reading these reviews, staring at my Kindle again with skepticism and wondering what on earth did I miss? Different strokes for different folks I suppose.",0,0,0,0

My all-time favorite films include 3 Tarkovskys, and in the realm of espionage movies I vastly prefer Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy to Jack Ryan running around and killing faceless ninjas and so on.I guess we're supposed to root for and ""identify"" with Hoffman here, but it's really hard except as you bring in positive feelings for the actor based on what he's done in other films. He's a cipher, supposedly world-weary and all that with some back-story that's never shown in flashback or explained.

This album is a joke, and a few jerks are trying to raise its ratings artificially so that more people get taken in.  It's mean, and it's a lousy thing to do to someone else.  All of the good reviews admit that it's arrhythmic, atonal, raspy, gritty, bad musicianship, with bass that sounds like someone falling downstairs, etc.  Think to yourself: how could this be simultaneously so unpleasant to listen to, but also worthy of 5 stars?  Of course, it can't be.  It's a stupid prank, and so are the 5 star reviews.  Half the time they insult your intelligence, and the other half of the time, they try to make you insecure.

The weekly spread is nice, and I like the dotted grid to make lists etc.  The coils seem secure and the  cover is protected by a vinyl attached sheet.I purchased this planner because I had gotten a cheap one at Home Goods which was falling apart after one month of use.

I've recommended/purchased/deployed dozens, if not hundreds, over a 20+ career in IT.  Back in 2014 I purchased the bigger version (WF-7620) of this AIO printer for my own home office. Price/features seemed great.  The printer worked for about 6 months, then started having serious printing problems.  I burned through what felt like hundreds of dollars in ink trying to fix it to no avail.  It ended up on the curb for bulk junk pick-up.Since I had more ink for this line of printer, and trying to not leave a brand I was once loyal to, I picked up the WF-3620.  It worked for about the same amount of time, then had the EXACT SAME PROBLEMS with printing.  Epson support was a joke.  I've been limping along with this printer for the past 6 months suffering through sub-standard prints (smudges, poor text quality, etc.) Today I had critical documents that I had to load on a USB drive and bring to kinkos so I could print them in acceptable quality.  That's why I'm on providing this review.  This printer is going on the curb, like it's big brother, along with whatever ink I have left over.

RR8OMQE313N0P,"This book was written with some mastery of the English language, and I would have given the book a three star had it been original.  The plot was copied almost exactly from Star Wars.  Think about it for a second.  It starts with a Rebel convoy being destroyed by an Imperial interception, but the Princess ejects the item that the Imperial taskforce was seeking.  Now, if this wasn't in a review of a fantasy book, wouldn't this have sounded exactly like the beginning of Star Wars.  Then, a young boy from a farming town  finds the item in a field, and eventually his home is destroyed by Imperial forces, and his parents killed.  Again, exactly like Star Wars.  Then, a mysterious hermit agrees to teach him the ancient arts of a dead order of protectors.  Jedi, anybody?  Eventually, he dies in the process of saving the Princess.  Killed by Darth Vader, no doubt.  Then Luke, I mean Eragon, is joined by a Han Solo figure.  It just goes on like this for the entire book; a clear and obvious parody of Star Wars.  In the end, the evil mage is killed, and we recieve some insight into how he was once a good little boy, but possessed by evil spirits.  Exactly like Vader!  This is just stupid, and disgusting.  Even some of the names of places in this books are from Tolkien.  Eragon, sounds a lot like Aragorn, doesn't it? Then, the lake Isenstar.  IsenGARD becomes a lake after it's destroyed in Lord of the Rings.  Then, the super-orc things sent by the evil emporer sound a lot like the Uruk-hai from Tolkien.  Once again, practically copied from Tolkien.  And then, there is the corny humor and names, like ""Saphira"".  Ugggh.  I give it a 2 only because it's kind of impressive that a 17 year old published this long of a book, even if the entire thing is a blatant copy of prominent works in science-fiction and fantasy.

At no time, was it specified that the update must be positive. I’m changing my rating from 2 stars to 1 star, as since my first review, my printer has become non-operational. Initially I was able to print fine if I only needed to print in black ink. After several attempts with head cleanings, printer alignments etc., my printer will not even print in black, nor color. I now own an expensive paperweight. So, this ink may work for some, or it may not.Original review: I used these cartridges in an HP 8600 Office Jet Plus.  If you only need to print in black all the time then these refills would receive 5 stars.However, the black cartridge does something to mess up my color printing.  I first tried the Fuzoo black with genuine HP color cartridges that were already installed.  Colors were muddy and nowhere near to true.  I then tried replacing the HP cartridges with the color Fuzoo to use together with the Fuzoo black cartridge, same deal, no improvement.  I even opened and tried the 2nd black cartridge they sent thinking maybe the first was defective.  Color printing still would not work correctly.  I really wanted to like these cartridges since the price is beyond reasonable, but the way it messes up the color printing is unacceptable.I also tried cleaning the print heads and aligning the print heads several times.  Neither action worked and the aligning actually failed. Included in my review is a picture of images printed with the Fuzoo ink cartridges (left) and HP cartridges (right).",0,0,0,0

R29ETQV5GBQ9UV,"I really want to love these pens. I bought a bunch of them in various colors and used them for all of my writing at school and at work. I like the line they put down and that the ink doesn't smear when my hand moves across the page (I'm left-handed).There are two issues I have with the Sharpie Pens, though. The first one is the flaking of the barrel. The silver finish on the barrel flakes off and goes everywhere. It is all over the inside of the pen pocket in my backpack, it gets on my hands and face, and it gets on my paper. This is annoying, but I am willing to live with it because the pens write nicely.The second problem is the leaking. This is the problem that takes these pens to a 1-star rating for me. I didn't have any problems in the winter, but the weather here just warmed up and all of my Sharpie Pens began to leak on the same day. The ink leaks all over my hands and my desk. I had to throw the whole lot of them away. These were my favorite pens, but I can't have pens that only work during cold months. I will be looking elsewhere for my new go-to pen.",0,0,0,0
R1GXD5QL7IW89T,"Let me start off by saying, I am a HUGE Beyonce fan, and I am not in any way ""hating"" on her.I love her voice, her stage presence, her look; I mean, the girl is BAD(in a good way)! Now, with that said, I really expected more from her. Like I've read in so many people's reviews, I heard 'Deja Vu' and I just KNEW this album was gonna be off the hook. However, that was not the case. I really like the strength and fierceness of B-Day (I'm all for female empowerment), but the songs seem really...sloppy in a way.Beyonce is a creative and talented songwriter,but on B-day its like she was writing for Keshia Cole (a simpler, more 'urban' style). Not saying that she doesn't appeal to the urban crowd, its just that Beyonce is a little more sophisticated than what she's showing us in B-Day. Dangerously in Love was a better album. She had dance songs, love songs, feel-good songs; it took you to so many places that few artists can go on an album. B-day did not do that for me. Beyonce has the potential to produce a great album; I'm looking forward to her next project. Sorry B, I still love you though!",0,0,0,0
R2OG5KDWH1FEI7,"Well it works, surprisingly, thus 2 stars instead of 1.The battery compartment cover was cocked at an angle and the casing is very flimsy. You install the batteries and then have to screw that base in. Its a very awkward fit I had to fiddle with it a lot to get it to not cross thread  The black coating is a flimsy plastic coating over very thin casing and has already started to peel away.  I used it to probe examine a rifle chamber.  The LED light is actually too bright and directional and that plastic head that holds the LED is a bit too large.  To make matters worse apparently casual contact with a light coating of CLP in the chamber has removed part of the finish on the plastic end, so I suspect with repeated use the plastic holding the LED will fail. The laser pointer switch is momentary, so you cant use this for hands off boresighting.Bottom line, its cheap and made cheap and not worth the shipping cost to complain to the vendor.",0,0,0,0

R1F77MEQ5YRIP0,"I'm guessing here that everyone who has rated this chair has rated it after very short period of time usage (possibly even within a week). I have absolutely no idea how the ratings are so high. I absolutely NEVER review anything on amazon unless it is a really great product and I'm happy about it, but my experience with this chair has been absolutely egregious and I'm seething while I'm writing this.The chair looks nice, it has a very nice appearance, however it is evident that the company who manufactured this chair has zero quality control, and no desire to have good customer support. I laughed reading someone else's joke on here about the company name (Cavalier) because it is very fitting to how they treat you as a customer.Now, that being said. I have NEVER, and I mean NEVER purchased or even used a product with as poor quality control as this one. Every single screw falls out despite being relentlessly tightened down meticulously (I am an engineer so I do not cut corners). There are holes through which the screws fit and these circular pieces that are inserted over the holes for aesthetic are consistently found on the ground, no matter how many times I put them back where they go. I sit back, (and mind you, I am 120 lbs at most), and the chair falls apart and breaks because the screws don't stay put. The seat portion of the chair is built for inhumanely long thighs (my body type is long and lanky) and because of this alone, it is very poor for any back support. I keep a back support cushion at the back of the chair which is at the thinnest portions at least 2 inches thick and my very long legs still are off the ground when I'm sitting with my back against the chair.DO NOT buy this item. The customer support is absolutely horrible and they want to charge you $15 for any replacement screws (no, you have to buy the whole kit). They provide no replacement screws initially (only the exact amount, I'm sure to save money because they seem very cheap). The entirety of the chair is $90 and paying $15 just for some screws is ridiculous.Okay, put this way, if you don't mind having tripping and choking hazards all over your floor (circular pieces and screws) and you aren't actually going to sit in the chair, then this $90 decoration would be a very nice addition. Don't plan on sitting in it. In addition, if you really enjoy a quick pick-me-up every morning of reassembling your office chair, then this chair may be perfect for you as well. Just make sure to buy the appropriate hex screw because they won't provide that for you. Oh, and definitely keep your hex key on your desk for convenience.",0,0,1,1

R31XCIKHAUOI3V,"When I saw that James Herbert had a new novel coming out I was looking forward to reading it, then when Amazon reduced the price of the kindle book to only 20p I was very pleased, downloaded it and pushed it to the top of my TBR list and started reading it after I'd finished my previous novel. I'd almost bought it the week before when it was £4.99 but god am I glad I didn't, in fact at the moment I feel hard done by having paid 20 pence for it.To be fair I have only read 30% so far but I've now lost the will to read anymore, I may have a break and come back to it again later and if the book does improve I will of course delete this review and write a new one (but don't hold your breath).It is childishly written and overlong and to be honest I know it's a horror novel but the characters are completely unbelievable. Life is too short and at the moment I have no inclination to carry on with this one, disappointing from an author I used to love and whose books I started reading when I was a teenager.I hope his next one is better but I can now see why his publishers allowed this one to be reduced to such a cheap price.",0,0,0,0
R30ONJ12X80DBM,"I give this two stars instead of one because the cordless phone and answering machine aspects of the product work fine. But the star feature of this model, the ""audio/visual doorbell answering system,"" fails completely.First, the camera has narrow angle of view. While some may argue that this reduces distortion of the visitor's face, it also makes it difficult to see who/what else is at the door. Second, the camera is black and white, and the resolution is very low, resulting in blurry and grainy images most of the time. The image is almost impossible to see when you have strong backlight, as is often the case in front of my front door, where the camera is located, throughout much of the day. Third, you cannot use the video mode unless the camera is hooked up to AC power; in my case this is difficult to achieve because I do not have an outlet outside of the door so I use two AA batteries for the camera unit, which means I cannot turn on the video mode from the handsets. (I have not tested the night vision aspect of the camera, as I do not get night visitors at all.)Another serious problem is, oftentimes, you have a significant delay between when the doorbell button is pressed and when you actually receive the image (and the accompanying doorbell sound) on the handset. This is frustrating in a funny way because I can hear the doorbell from the camera unit when someone presses the button, and when I pick up the handset, it takes a few seconds for the image and the ding-dong to appear on my handset. In the beginning, I often got startled by the second ding-dong bell, the one coming from the handset speaker. This is ridiculous because my handset is no more than 25 ft. away from the door. Why the communication delay???The doorbell control functions on the handset are ridiculously difficult to use. I read the instructions when I first got this from Amazon Vine for review. A couple of days later, when someone was really at the door and rang the bell, I actually couldn't figure out how to recall the image. Also, sometimes when I press on the handset buttons, they do not respond, or respond with a delay, kind of like using an Android phone.So in summary, this product, while looking attractive and having solid phone/answering machine functions, fails miserably as a doorbell monitor.",0,0,0,0

R2JGI1YJOVKNMM,"This is a very disappointing production.  As other reviewers have said, it definitely is far below the quality of recent BBC productions.  In fact, very far below those lofty standards.  If you collect the several criticisms that have been posted on this, they are all correct.  First, unless you know very little about natural history, you will learn nothing from these programs.  I would not say the the narrative is error-prone, as in the narrative in some PBS Nature productions, it is just simple-minded and hard to listen to for any length of time.  In one episode, on fresh water, you will flip from shots of tropical animals to a temperate stream, with no apparent reason.  This is typical- you will be flipped from clip to clip in a sequence that may have been random!  Much of the source material was very low quality, but most of it was very good, in fact.  It is what the film editors did with these clips that boggles the viewers.  Invariably, time motion is jerky and interrupted, so that, in panning landscape shots in particular, there is no smooth motion at all.  At first I thought that this was related to digital artifacts (and there are many of those), but no, this was intentional.  If you see a good clip (and there are many), you will have only about one second at most to watch it, before you are flashed to something else.  Whoever put this together may have had a background in ""creative video editing,"" but clearly no evident appreciation for the thoughtful observation of nature by a viewer.  One would think that the theme of water movement and its impact on various ecosystems could be the basis of a meaningful production, but this one is very hard for me to watch.  Maybe other people process visual information differently than I do!  Anyway, for awesome productions see BBC productions on the Galapagos, Planet Earth, and most of the Yellowstone production.  I really enjoy watching those, as much as I find this water series difficult to enjoy.  Good natural history video?  It starts with outstanding cinematography, but also requires excellent research and thematic focus on scripts, and careful film editing to preserve the special art of this medium.

It's nice and slim, so it fits the glove box easily.- I like how thick the card is that you can record the maintenance history on.The Bad:- Needs to be at least a half inch taller. When you fold your service receipts in half, they stick out above the folders. You'll have to keep them all the way in the back if you don't want them blocking all the tabs. You can close the top flap with them in there, but it's not completely flush, so it won't close as tightly as it would without them.- There needs to be at least one more maintenance card. They make it look like you get two cards. One with the labels on top, the other without. You don't. You just get the one with labels on it, and you tear those off. Really misleading. For older vehicles, or those of us that like to do more work than just the regular maintenance, there's not going to be enough space. My card is more than halfway full, and I'll be pretty close to finishing it after some work I'm doing this week. That sucks.Overall, this will work fine, but it's always annoying to have little issues that make it pretty obvious the person selling it doesn't even use it themselves.

R6VOIZ6010D5E,"Disappointing. I purchased this printer along with the extended warranty because it received good reviews. I wanted a reasonable duplex printer/scanner combo. First, it was difficult to set up wirelessly. Printers don't come with manuals anymore. After the installation failed twice, I phoned only to find out that I needed to use a notebook device to set up the printer with my computer. Really?!? The ink cartridges looked small. They worked fine the first time but, after replacement, the printer did not recognize the Magenta cartridge, which meant nothing prints. I went online to research it and tried the recommended troubleshooting tips. No success. I e-mailed Epson who made me repeat the troubleshooting to no avail. Finally, they tell me something is wrong and I must phone Epson. I told them I want this thing out of my house. They say I cannot return it but can only get a replacement. So I phone and the new person verifies the troubleshooting and tells me there is something wrong. They say I must give them a deposit to have the new printer sent. When I protest, they say I can send it (and pay shipping costs) and they will send the replacement upon receipt of the original. Epson employees conspicuously do not comment about the extended warranty. I think I must switch to Brother printers. I wish I could just return the Epson and be done with it. This is just sad.I received the replacement printer--a refurbished product. Sad. I finally got it installed wirelessly. (I hope you own an iPad.) It is having difficulty connecting to my devices.

R3UDNMTP3WW0U0,"When Good Ghouls Go Bad (Patrick Read Johnson, 2001)I now find myself forced to ask questions that it never occurred to me I would have to: what in the world is the Syfy Channel doing showing a movie that was originally made for ABC Family, that absolutely horrid station that is ABC's (and was originally Fox's) attempt to capture part of the screaming-adolescent market currently held by Disney Channel and Nickelodeon? And why didn't the description warn me about this when I went to record it? Most importantly, why in the world didn't I turn it off when I realized what I was getting myself into?Plot, in the smallest nutshell I can find: the town of Walker Falls does not celebrate Halloween, and hasn't in the twenty years since a dying Curtis Danko laid a curse on the town. James Walker (Everwood's Tom Amandes), the umpty-great-grandson of the town's founder, has come back to town to reopen his father's chocolate factory, which was shut down after the curse (there's some sort of rationalization about how a chocolate factory will encourage kids to celebrate Halloween, or something). While the townsfolk are afraid the reopening of the plant will set off the curse, there's no denying the economy needs it. James plans to reopen the plant on Halloween, with a big party. Needless to say, the curse is real, and a whole bunch of oddly cute ghouls, including the recently-deceased eccentric Uncle Fred (Christopher Lloyd), pop up to remind the townspeople that this might not be the world's best idea.I'll start off by saying that if you are the kind of person who is capable of withstanding the sound of shrieking adolescents, then you and I are coming from very different places, and this review does not apply to you. (The acid test: if you can watch five minutes of That's So Raven without wanting to tear your hair out.) I find it an even more unbearable sound than shrieking babies, so I find the vast bulk of programming on channels like Disney, Nick, and ABC Family painful. Yes, actually, physically painful. In order for me to give an original movie from one of those stations even a mediocre review, it would have to have an Oscar-worthy script, a prodigy director, a top-notch cast who all brought their A game, or some combination of the above. When Good Ghouls Go Bad, not surprisingly, has none of these elements; the script is about as good as can be expected given that Johnson (whose biggest previous writing credit was the terrible, terrible 1990 stoner comedy Spaced Invaders) was adapting a story from R. L. Stine, who can charitably be described as the Danielle Steel of teen horror. As a director, Johnson has hardly fared better. When your best-known directorial credit is a movie often regarded as one of the worst in history (Baby's Day Out), there's really nowhere to go but up...unless you just stay on the same plane, which seems to be Johnson's MO. And the cast? Lloyd is the biggest of the bunch, and let's face it, since Who Framed Roger Rabbit?, Lloyd's career has been a painful illustration of the downward spiral. (With the notable exception of Wit, released, ironically, the same year as this mess.) It's terrible through and through. The only reason I'm giving it half a star is because, for some reason I cannot entirely fathom, I did not turn it off. ½",0,0,0,0

Would not finish the stapling process, the final click to close the staple would not happen no matter how hard you squeezed.  I bought a replacement here at Amazon, and after opening the box, the replacement will not staple, just clogs and jams.  Even when going through one sheet of paper.  Swingline makes their staplers in China now, they definitely don't care about their product name or reputation anymore.Well, after returning the product and having a replacement sent to me from Amazon I thought I would edit my review.  The new one worked much better than the first.  The first one would not staple at all, the replacement worked for an amazing run of 5 STAPLES before it broke!  I guess improvement comes in small steps.  I returned this one, but not for a replacement, I am getting my money back...  Amazon should not disgrace themselves by offering such a horrible product on their website.  If anyone here needs four boxes of overpriced special staples that this thing takes, I have them.",0,0,0,0
R1V91TMYVX3H1W,"As any ASOIAF reader will know by now, George R.R. Martin really doesn't do much writing nowadays. So we don't really know when (or more likely if) the next book will be released. Luckily, here's a new book to bridge the time in between books. It's called 'The World of Ice and Fire', and it's much in the vein of similar books for other fantasy series, like 'The World of Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time'. Similar to that book, this one contains lots of impressive art, which may be the number one reason for most people to buy this. Because that's unfortunately where the positive comparison ends. While the Jordan book is an encyclopedia depicting accurate and well-written trivia of his world, this one is a poorly written laudry list of various kings and queens and their one defining character trait. Since it's written from the point of view from one of the 'Maesters', it's also intentionally inaccurate (the real reason for that probably is because the rest of the series hasn't been written; therefore you'll also find a lot of the more interesting parts of the world - e.g. the white walkers - missing any useful new information). The writing style really is the most bothering thing here. Even reading the most horrible atrocities feels like a chore, it's that boring. Which brings me to the question of how much Martin's involvement actually has been in this book. Apparently it has been co-written by two fans, which really makes this glorified fan fiction - and it shows. I don't know why Martin would lend his name to this (and promote it), if it's that sub-par to the first three books. The worst parts of book five read like this (which really makes you think...), and that's not a compliment. If fans want to write their own encyclopedia, why don't they do this based on the already published books or wait until the series is complete? (Even if that realistically means there'd never be a book like this.) Reading this now, I just didn't know what came from Martin and what came from the fans and I simply could not stand constantly feeling 'is this the real vision?'. No matter how big a fan they are and no matter how much they tried to write what Martin (probably) told them to, they aren't Martin. In all honesty, I wouldn't buy this book. Yes, the art is great (and for that I award this two stars), but the writing is horrible and the content is nothing you couldn't find in fan fiction forums.",0,0,0,0
R1QJEYN49K18F8,DO NOT I REPEAT DO NOT USE THIS INK!!!!!!! learn from my mistake. This is the first time I have purchased this ink and I have never had this problem with any other remanufactured ink! I put it in my printer and hit the ok for the no HP ink as usual. Then I started hearing these sputtering and splattering sounds I thought it sounded weird but was like ok.... then the printer touch screen says ink system failure... I open the printer to find ink splattered on the walls and back of the printer and a pool of ink where the cartridges usually slide to..... I’ve tried turning off and on several times and all I get is system failure!!! So now this $9 ink is probably going to cost me $100s in a new printer!!! Not good! I should have just stuck with inkjetsuperstore.com who I’ve used for YEARS without problems!!!!!!!!! While obviously from other reviewers this ink works for some it didn’t for me and I got burned big. Maybe mine was just faulty but it won’t happen again so beware!!!!

R34FLRO34QRNAB,"3/3/2011.  This is an update to my original review (see below).  To recap, I liked the machine in principal but it had a few severe weaknesses:  had to reboot frequently to get the computer and printer to talk to each other and it could not handle card stock.  I was managing to work with that until I started to get wide blue streaks across the pages.  Must be the print head, I thought, so ran the head cleaner utility provided by Lexmark.  After that was done I got a message that the process did not work and gave instructions how to remove the head and clean.  I did as instructed, put it back in, and since that time I only get a message that ""there is a problem with the print head"".  When I searched the web for solutions I read many reports of a similar issue with the print heads, with no one having a suitable solution.  Then I tried to find a replacement print head but they did not seem to exist. Long story short, I now have a $200 printer with unused ink cartridges and all together nothing works. You can take a chance and see if you can get one that works, but if I were you it is not worth the significant hassle.Below is my earlier reviewFirst of all, I got this printer mainly to print in black, except for the rare occasion that I want to print greeting cards in color, and to use the copier.  It seemed to be very easy to set up, and printing and copying is a real snap while it is working.  The problem that I have is that if the printer jambs, which is does frequently while printing on heavier card stock, the print spooler seems to get stuck and I get the ""printer is unable to communicate with the computer"" error message.  I am then unable to delete the item from the sprint spooler, and the only way to continue printing is to reboot the computer.  This same issue arises if the computer goes ""to sleep"" - all communications with the printer stops until a reboot.  I did not have this issue with any of the other 2 printers I have had in the past on this computer, only the Lexmark.  I did manage to print 45 greeting cards in color (with much difficulty) and the ink usage, both color and black and white, was very minimal, so the price of each color cartridge do not concern me.  Like other printers with a front load, the heavier card stock has to do a 180 turn to pass by the print head and that is where the jamb seems to occur.  If making cards is something you want to do I recommend getting a back loaded printer instead of this one.  I have not tested it at all yet with photos, however.  I have rated the installation as three stars because while the instructions were clear and the installation seemed to go easily, the problem with the necessary reboot to print so consistantly happening I just decided to blame the setup routine for not addressing this issue.  For those that this matters, I am using Vista.  The scanner works fine with multiple choices as to the output (Word, Adobe, print, etc.)",0,0,0,0

R6M6RQI092TP2,"I play CS:GO, just under 6000 hours in and still going strong. I have used many mousepads over the years. The list includes:Logitech G440Razer Goliathus Speed LargeRazer Goliathus Speed ExtendedHyperX Fury S ProHyperX GTF-XCorsair MM300 ExtendedCorsair MM600Steelseries Qck+Steelseries Qck+ LimitedFnatic Boost ControlFnatic Boost SpeedA Used Cutting Board (literally)As well as many not special or famous brand mousepadsI do not consider this a fast mouse pad. I have played with hard pads, soft pads, and hybrids. It has the worst aspects of both kinds of mousepads. The Static Friction is very high as a result of the mousepad's surface. Static Friction is the force keeping an object at rest, as in not moving. Some people prefer high friction mousepads so they can ""stop on a dime"", right when they wish the mouse to stop moving, they just stop applying force. This is not a typical high friction mousepad.The problem is that this mousepad has an odd ratio of the Static Friction to the Kinetic Friction.Kinetic Friction is the force stopping or slowing a moving object.Its difficult for me to explain precisely how one of the problems feel;When the mouse is moving in one direction, in order to then move in a different direction while moving you have to overcome the friction of the mousepad again at that angle. I assume it is because of the way the stitching is done.I haven't had this issue with other higher friction mousepads.It makes it difficult for me in games that requires non straight line movements.I switch between mousepads sometimes based on situation, or how my mouse feet are behaving. Currently my pair is the HyperX GTF-X, and the Razer Goliathus Speed Large. With the GTF-X the static friction is low, so small movements in any direction can be done with very little effort. The kinetic friction is very close to the static friction, so I can consistently make wide turns with small adjustment after. With the Goliathus Speed, the static friction is slightly higher, but the kinetic friction is lower it requires less force than the initial force to keep the mouse moving.I play a Support/2nd-3rd Entry role on my team; I recognize that entrying is easier with the Goliathus Speed, so I can do several 180° turns, and they don't have to be accurate on the small scale, since it is close range and teammates are engaging. Otherwise the GTF-X is comfortable for everything else.I cannot effortlessly use the QCK+ Limited because the static friction is higher than is comfortable, and the kinetic friction while moving is still rather high, but less sticky feeling than the static frictionThis mousepad fits neither of my roles and therefore I can not recomend it personally. Some of you may prefer the way it feels. If you play other games, the issues I stated above will likely not apply.P.S. My feeling of fast and slow may be radically different than others because I played on hard pads much of my career too. I would even mix lotion with water on a folded rag and coat the surface of the hard pad with the mixture, wiping it clean every few minutes. There was so little friction that If I put a folded peice of paper under one side, the mouse would slide off the table. I had to apply force to stop the mouse when it was moving. If I lightly tapped it on with a finger, it would slide accross until its feet dropped off the surface of the hardpad.Please consider my perspective in your evaluation of my review, and your decisions because of it.",0,0,0,0
R3DKGJBT3KD06,"I almost never write bad reviews, but these are the worst pants I have ever purchased. I read the full Q&A and multiple positive and negative reviews before purchasing these pants. Unfortunately, the negative reviews are on-point. Problem #1 was the fit and sizing. Erring on the side of caution knowing sizes often run small from sellers such as this, I took the advice of other customers and purchased 2 sizes up in order to have a loose, comfortable fit. This was not the case. The waistband is useless and too lengthy. It has no tension or strength, and droops after only a short time of wear. There is not enough actual pant at the waist. The length of the pant leg was actually great (I am 6’ tall), but the fit was tight in the hip area initially and quite loose everywhere else. (Very odd fit, and I likely would not have been able to wear them at all had I purchased a smaller size.) That leads to problem #2. The fabric was exceptionally weak around the crotch area. I wore the pants to work (office job, nothing strenuous) and after approximately 3.5 hours of wear, the fabric had ripped open in the crotch area and the fabric continued to rip further horizontally across the rear throughout the day, and not even on a seam! It was as if the fabric was practically disintegrating and shredding! The pants also became otherwise so loose throughout the day that I literally had to tie something around my waist to (a) cover the ripped fabric and (b) hold up the pants.

R22LZX7R05QUSH,"IN SHORT: ""Destroyer Angel"" continues Nevada Barr's trend of getting away from natural beauty and natural dangers and concentrating more on terror and brutality specifically by men against women and children. Her novels are no longer special. The novels feel like they were written in a New York City apartment, or maybe from a loved-one's hospital bedside---not from a staff cabin in a National Park (as did the first 5 or 6 Anna Pigeon novels ).

But, probably like most fans who have been with her from the beginning, I continue to hope that she will find her way ""home"".CRITIQUE>""Destroyer Angel"" is a well constructed action-and-suspense novel with good character development and a dollop of droll humor.  If you've liked other recent Nevada Barr novels, you'll like ""Destroyer Angel"".>  If you haven't read Nevada Barr before, and you cannot tolerate stories of women's suffering at the hands of men, you may not enjoy ""Destroyer Angel"".> Like many other readers (particularly male readers), as evidenced by many of the negative reviews,  I am very uncomfortable reading stories of women being abused by men---for several reasons and multiple levels.  But ""Destroyer Angel"" is no more intense on this theme than any of at least the past 5 or 6 Anna Pigeon novels.  In general, I enjoyed Nevada Barr's early novels more---which always featured bad men, but also featured bad women, contained less cruelty to women and children, and concentrated a bit more on the struggle to survive against the implacable wilderness and wild predators.> Click on “Stoney” just below the product title to see my other reviews.",0,0,0,0

R12DLMG1T6AMLR,"Ash by James Herbert is the third in the series- yet it has enough stand-alone information woven throughout the story-line that it could be read on its own. This book has been the reason that I've slept with my lights on the last few nights. It had all the ingredients necessary for a kick-butt horror story: the creepy castle in Scotland, luxury and wealth, a whole host of bad guys all under the same roof, and a tormented, parapsychologist who has been hired to investigate.I accepted this book for a review because I'd read good things about James Herbert. While horror is not my go-to genre, I have respect for King's earlier works and have been working my way through some other titles as well. While the horror elements contained within Ash were not bad (even succeeding, as evidenced by the light comment above), it were other parts of the story that came off as simply not-believable. The entire book takes place within a three-day main period... that alone is not enough though for my criticism. Ultimately, it was the relationship that develops between David Ash and one of the staff at the castle. Within one day these two adults, both of whom have had traumatic, romantic encounters, are declaring their love for one another and are unable to keep their hands off one another. Add that into the fact that David Ash is to investigate a massive castle along with the other horrors that are happening and it all translates into at least 60 hour days.I read, after finishing the final pages of Ash, that this is not the finest of Herbert's work. At this point in time, I'll have to just take those reviewers word for it - because of Ash is any indication of what Herbert is capable of, I'm afraid I'm just not interested.",0,0,0,0

R1IOZ6ICU34C0L,"I followed all of the instructions, installed the software and connected the device. When I tried to capture an image it said ""Scanner is not connected."" I went on the Veho website and saw this problem in the FAQ section. Their solution is to make sure you are using a 2.0 USB port, and preferably one that is on your computer, not a hub. I was already doing that. Then it says sometimes it can't detect your scanner if you have other image capture devices plugged in (other scanners, printers) so I unplugged all of my other USB devices and restarted my computer. Still nothing. I uninstalled the software and re-installed it using the download on their website (instead of the disc that came with my scanner) and it still didn't work. I tried installing on two other computers and it didn't work on those either!If you could use this scanner with the native image capture program on your computer I wouldn't care about this issue at all, but it ONLY works with this software. Either my scanner is defective or (and I think this is more likely since somebody else already left a review saying it doesn't work with Macbook Air) it just doesn't work with macs. All three of my computer are macs (2 imac desktops and one macbook air, 2 running Lion and one running Snow Leopard.) so I can't test it on a PC for comparison but I'd definitely be wary of ordering this model if you only have a mac.",0,0,0,0

Soon after receiving this product I knew that buying this was a terrible mistake. But I decided not jump to conclusions so soon and decided to give it a try. Although every joint in this stand can be adjusted to the desired angle, adjusting it take a LOT of time and you have to be really patient to get both legs adjusting at the same angle at corresponding joints!! Also, the worst part is, finger tip/nail gets hurt in the process of adjusting if one is not extremely careful. It did hurt my finger tips and that's when I decided to return the product. With every other flaw in this product, I was not ready to continue to get hurt using this. Also, it is not a good stand for bed at all.

Battery NOT.You will see the same unit under different brand names but I am sure that is the same company.  And when you look at the reviews, the battery is the usual suspect.  Some reviews say that the battery only provided one use and then it was dead.  This is a battery that should provide 2-3 years of service.The battery is rated IPX5 which means it can withstand limited moisture.  And while it may have gotten slightly wet from handling, I did not submerge it in water.I contacted the company and they responded by saying that they would provide another battery.

Very quick and easy assembly, looks just as the pic and description. However, in just about 3 weeks, it broke. Fell over and crashed to the ground. Rather than deal with a return since our cats really see to like it, I drilled new holes in the bottom board and reassembled it. But that was a very temporary fix. It has already broken a second time. The main cat that plays with this is a kitten of only 3-4 months of age, she isn't large or heavy, so that is not the issue. So, for the 2nd time in only 5 weeks we are without the tower we bought for our kitten to keep her from destroying other things. I will either find another way to fix it or have to buy another one.

R3NV9AUKNB2BMA,"I am so disappointed in this planner.  I'm a teacher and use my planner for everything, after reading rave reviews I decided to purchase this planner and I hate it will a passion.  The cons:-It's not hardback, rather a laminated paper cover which is not going to last-You can only use it if you lie it flat, you can't fold any pages behind.  Which is very cumbersome and hard to use if I am on the go and trying to write something quickly.  Plus, it takes up way too much room on my desk open flat.-The stickers are cute but a complete pain to put on.  They are cheap and flimsy.-There are no times or lines on the daily planner section, just 3 boxes.  I suppose you could section them into morning, midday and afternoon but it doesn't work for my purposes-If you are flipping through the months quickly, the pages stop and snag.  I have 2 that are already almost torn and I've been using this for less than a week.Pros:-It's pretty.If you seriously use a planner that gets taken to and from work with you I would avoid this one.

RH9QYNGELYZGA,"These are expensive and it (SILVER PAINT) worked great right out of the box.When I started using it, I gave it a 5⭐️review.After all, I do love SHARPIE markers.HOWEVER, after a few months, the tip wouldn't pass paint anymore and the paint simply blobs and drips out of the wick❗️Even if the fine-tip has paint in it, something is plugging up the very end of the tip so that the paint will not transfer onto the item you are writing on.Other reviewers have shared similar experiences.The tip works as two pieces:A thicker paint-absobing cylindrical ""wick"" fits into the metal cup holding the fine-tip-wick.  By drepressing the tip into marker, paint is suppused to get wicked up and flow into the fine-point-tip where you can use it like a pen.It works very well, AT FIRST.The entire wick-tip assembly became so loose that it easily popped off of the marker when trying to clean it.Shaking; dabbing; trying different angles; nothing would get the fine-tip to smoothly run the paint anymore after less than 9 months of ownership.The marker shakes just fine, and the paint is very fluid.BUT NOW THE PAINT SIMPLY FLOWS AROUND THE BIG WICK AND DRIPS A BIG BLOP OF PAINT DOWN AND OVER THE FINE-POINT.It uses very little paint when working, so it can last for a very long time, BUT WHAT GOOD IS IT IF IT WON'T WORK AFTER A FEW USES?I tried cleaning the fine-point-tip with alcohol.It cleaned up perfectly, it absorbed paint again, but it still wouldn't flow properly through the tip as it did when first purchased.It seems as if the end of the tip hardens and acts like a plug on the paint trying to flow through it.Either way, WHAT IS WRONG WITH THESE THINGS!",0,0,0,0
R2TZ6TETVFAU60,"Let me explain why 1 star:  this is not a bad ink, but it does NOT do what it says it will do.  If it was just advertised as a regular ink, with no anti-feather/anti-bleed guarantee, I'd give maybe 4 stars.  But its not.  The name of the ink is ""X-Feather"", so you'd expected it not to feather, right?  That's the whole purpose of the ink.  But it does.  I experienced feathering and bleed-through on cheap and mid-grade (but still inexpensive) paper with the noodler's black X-Feather.  AND with Noodler's bulletproof American Eel.  NOT using a flex nib, or any other hardware that may make bleeding worse.  Using the pilot metropolitan with fine nib (which is very well made and was brand-new, so not a pen problem).  Not to be a grumpy ink hater (but kind of because I AM grumpy about this), but I don't really understand everyone's hype about the Noodler's X-Feather.  All of my experience with it has still been plenty feathery with substantial bleed-through on cheap paper.

Every life, no matter how dysfunctional, has some moments of happiness and joy, however brief - those are missing in this book.  I found it odd that Hattie and her family, while successful in staying together as a family unit in spite of extreme poverty and infidelity, seems no better off in the end than would have been the case if the stereotypical 'Dad's in prison, Mom's an addict' had been depicted.",0,0,0,0
R19BMNVCSFMHAP,"Cat Jones, editor-in-chief of the Cosmo-esque Gloss magazine, goes to confront her nanny early one Sunday morning, and when she doesn't  get a response to the live in apartment, who does she call?  No, not the police, or her husband.  Cat calls Bailey Weggins, friend and freelance crime journalist at Gloss magazine.When Bailey enters the nanny's apartment, she finds the 22-year old nanny dead.  And Cat, always the editor-in-chief, assigns Baily to mirror the police investigation and determine what is going on.When I read the pre-releases for IF LOOKS COULD KILL (""Bridget Jones Meets Nancy Drew"") I thought it sounded like a fun book.  I've enjoyed good mysteries (such as THE ALPHABET MYSTERY SERIES by Sue Grafton) and I liked THE NANNY DIARIES, so I thought a marriage between the two would be fun.Unfortunately, we get a fairly standard mystery, and somewhat pedestrian plotting.Bailey Weggins is supposed to be observant, beseeched by her friend Cat to involve herself in this mystery because of her unique way of looking at things.  Mostly, Bailey looks at clothes.  Every character is first described by what they're wearing.Bailey is also into good food.  Each chapter has her hankering after a good penne putenesca or a fine rissoto.  I almost expect for the recipes and restaurant reviews to be included as an appendix.Also, the motivations of the main characters here are somewhat forced.  Why does Cat choose Bailey, of all people, to help her out with this?  When Bailey senses herself in danger, why doesn't she just beg off somehow?All in all, this was a disappointing entry into what will probably turn out to be a fairly average mystery series.  If you like mysteries in general, or if you are really in to behind the scenes glimpses of glamour magazines, then this book is for you.Otherwise, take a look at some of the other beach reading out there.Kilroy's Rating System:5 stars - Loved it, and kept it on my bookshelf.4 stars - Liked it, and gave it to a friend.3 stars - OK, finished it and gave it to the library.2 stars - Not good, finished it, but felt guilty and/or cheated by it.1 star - I want my hour back!

I don't have this peeling problems with the Dymo or Brother brand labels I've used in various label printers.Edit: In reponse to the comment noting that these are meant to be removeable labels- I did overlook that when I originally purchased them. That does make a difference. However, I'm leaving my review at 2 stars because I think they also fail as removeable labels. These are ""too removable"" and simply would not stay on the items. They kept peeling off after a few days, and lasted an even shorter time for items that were not perfectly flat.

R31WINA8JNGZ4I,"I wanted to like this book-- it has gotten a lot of good reviews and Bishop herself always comes off as a kind author who treats her fans nicely (unlike certain other authors)-- but I have to say I was disappointed in ""Written in Red."" I really enjoyed Bishop's original ""Black Jewels"" trilogy, but since then, I've found her work to have gotten weaker-- less imaginative and more focused on relationship issues that I frankly do not care a thing about, and ""Written in Red"" continues that trend.The book has a promising enough plot, focusing on a woman who can see the future when her skin is cut, and her escape from the compound she was kept in and then trying to adjust to a somewhat ""normal"" life in a place filled with vampires, shape-shifters, and elementals. Unfortunately, it is hard to feel the tension that is supposed to be there because one of the main antagonists is hard to take seriously (doing all these things is going to help her become an in-demand actress in a P.I. show in Sparkletown!... seriously), or else is disrupted by a bunch of ""cutesy"" episodes-- Meg is clumsy again! The wolves are begging for dog biscuits!The book also suffers in that the things that have promise, interest, or appear to be building to something big-- the poison, the drug,the antagonist's plans for a puppynapping, the big climatic human raid at the end-- none of it comes to anything or not anything of real importance; the poison is discovered before it was ingested, the drug was only tested and did not have a big effect, the closest they got to puppynapping was being in the doorway, and in the big climatic scene at the end the only casualties are an unnamed hawk, a wolf that was mean to Meg, and a pony that was old and was obviously going to have to be put down soon anyway.It did not help that I felt little connection with, or caring towards, the main characters in the book. Meg is a pretty typical Bishop heroine,innocent but with great power. Simon is a pretty typical Bishop hero, good-looking, powerful, alpha-male sort who is easily bossed around by the heroine. There is also a fatherly type character, a tough female character, cute animals, and a cute child wolf (who was overly saccharine for my tastes)-- all of them tropes that Bishop has used before, and which bring to mind other Bishop characters like Jaenelle, Damian, Satan, and Surreal, yet seem to lack both their depth and charm. I found the secondary characters to be more interesting than Meg or Simon, and thought Bishop played up Simon's alpha-maleness a bit too much.""Written in Red"" had promise, but it failed to deliver.

R6BS9UDBWS20B,"As I was reading reviews of this book, the first thing that came into my mind were the words of Yeshua, who said ""Every plant that my heavenly Father has not planted will be pulled up by the roots. Leave them; they are blind guides. If a blind man leads a blind man, both will fall into a pit."" Matthew 15:13-14Honestly, Leonardo is the only one who has done his homework when it comes to ""church"" history.When the Eklesia, the assembly of called out ones, or the Body of Believers in Jesus, was mostly Jewish, this nonsense about Replacement Theology was nonexistent. Three centuries later, when the ""church"" became predominantly Gentile and filled with the Greek way of thinking instead of the Hebrew way of thinking, the church become anti-Semitic and this false doctrine entered. The Bible began to be allegorized for the first time (Greek, gnostic thinking), and to fit new doctrines, it became necessary for the Bible to be ""interpreted"" in order to fit (like a square peg in a round hole) these new false doctrines. The new anti-Semitic church could not believe that hated Israel could possibly inherit the Kingdom of God, so the Bible had to be ""interpreted"" in order to ""fit"" this new view.This book leaves out discussion of so many scriptures that I cannot be silent. This theory which many Christians perhaps have been taught all their lives has too many holes to be credible. Christians who try to deny the plain text meaning of prophecies yet to be fulfilled would never do this with all the many prophecies that were LITERALLY fulfilled with Jesus' first coming. In fact, we use the literal fulfillment of prophecy to argue the case for Jesus being the Messiah!!The author begins with Daniel 9. The next chapter, as well as 11 and 12, are also important. Daniel 10, ironically, deals with Michael's battle against the Prince of Persia. Who can deny this battle is going on today? Persia is Iran!!! The Prince of Greece could be Greek thought that permeates the mainstream religion called Christianity. What about Zechariah chapters 12 thru 14. I had my son, at age 10, read these chapters and paraphrase. He told me exactly what they say. He can also read Lord of the Rings and tell me the story exactly as the author intended, but he also knows the deeper good versus evil meaning. ""A child shall lead them...""  He did not need to go to seminary or learn to interpret the Bible. The scriptures mean what they say, and they say what they mean. G-d repeats things over and over in the Bible and still people ignore them. How can you twist Ezekiel chapter 36. Count the ""I wills""!!  Please wake up, Eklesia!  Listen to the Shepherd. The sheep know His voice and listen to Him. Do not be a goat who does not listen to the Shepherd. Do not be sent to the left. He said some would be deceived, even among the elect. See He told us ahead of time. The people will be judged how?  By how they have treated His brothers in the FLESH. His Jewish brothers and sisters. Jesus is a Jew who will return as a Jew, the Lion of the Tribe of Judah who will sit on the throne of David in Jerusalem forever and forever. His Kindgom will have no end. The olive tree in Romans 11 has a Jewish root. We Gentiles have been grafted in, and we HAVE become arrogant against they natural branches who are in our day being grafted back in even as the unnatural (Gentile) branches are being broken off to make room for them. There are now over 100 Messianic congregations in Israel.  Hundreds of thousands of Jewish believers worldwide. Malachi prophesied, ""See, I will send you the prophet Elijah before that great and dreadful day of the Lord comes. He will turn the hearts of the fathers (Jewish people) to the hearts of the children (church), and the hearts of the children to their fathers, or else I will come and strike the land with a curse.""  Malachi 4:5-6Those who allegorize the plain Word of God will be speechless when standing before Him, He asks them why they did not believe what His prophets revealed. Even when almost every prophet spoke of the restoration of Israel. Before Jesus was taken up to heaven, He taught his disciples over a period of 40 days about the kingdom of God, and then His disciples asked Him, ""Lord, are you at this time going to restore the kingdom to Israel?""  He said to them: ""It is not for you to know the times or dates the Father has set by his own authority.""  Acts 1:6-7  Jesus did not correct his disciples to say the kingdom would not be be restored to Israel. He obviously had been teaching them that the kingdom would be restored for them to ask this question. This agrees with Paul in Romans 11:12 ""But if their transgression means riches for the world, and their loss means riches for the Gentiles, how much greater riches will their fullness bring!""  When Israel believes, the whole world will experience revival. When Jerusalem became united under Israeli rule in 1967 for the first time in almost 2000 years, revival broke out all over the world. Many Jews became believers this year, and the number of believers have steadily increased since.What about Isaiah chapter 11?  This is talking about life on Earth, when there will be peace one day. There will be no peace until Messiah returns. One thousand years of peace on Earth with Messiah rules and reigns. What about Amos 9:11-15?  This was not fulfilled prior to May 14, 1948. What about all of the prophet Joel?  Jesus wept over unbelieving Jerusalem as He entered it, and said He would not return until they said, ""Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord."" ""Baruch Haba B'Shem Adonai"" Matthew 23:39. This agrees with Zechariah 12 - 14.Believers in Yeshua, do not forsake God's people!  If we do not know what the Bible says from cover to cover, we will be greatly deceived in these last days.All these terms we have come up with, Dispensational, Covenant Theology.... Jesus is not amused by our lofty knowledge. None of us can believe the Bible without the Holy Spirit, the very Spirit of Truth. God is looking for a people who will worship Him in Spirit and in Truth. Let the Holy Spirit guide you into truth and not ""rules for interpretation"" and systems of theology.For a most coherent discussion of the end times, read Israel, the Church, and the Last Days by Keith Intrater and Dan Juster. Just as the Jews brought God's truth into the world the first time, so Messianic Jews are restoring truth to the Gentile believers. God's Perfect Plan! Believers, pray for the peace of Jerusalem and pray Psalms 83 over Israel. If God is calling you to pray for Israel in this hour, see thewatchman.org. God bless you!",0,0,0,0

R3AU3BICWGQI96,"Rex Stewart Movie Review:  Jackal This is a great story line, poorly executed.  During my first viewing, I was not impressed  by any aspect of the movie, except its potential to be a great movie.  The story line has  resulted in a Line of Fire wanna-be.  Pro's:  Best Gun this  decade.Director: 3/10  The Director really falls down in what could have  been a great movie.  I do not know all of the limitations imposed, but  clearly he had the budget for a great cast of characters. He does a poor  job of maintaining the drama.  The pace is maintained.  The movie is  reasonably exciting, but a relatively smooth sine wave.  I am surprised  that in the light of the poor writing and directing the Director did not  resort to more violence and high impact theatrics.  After all, he does have  the best gun of the decade. The Director and writers fail to generate  empathy for the protagonist, a common failing of potentially great movies.  (see Indochine).  Leading Actor: 4/10 I really like Bruce Willis, but he  was mis-cast and mis-written for the part. The character just is not the  Jackal.  (See John Malkovich,  Line of Fire).

R1L5UKXABJXLIM,"For you young'uns, Pauline Kael was a powerful, maverick movie critic who, aside from being a brilliantly entertaining writer, often went against the grain of your Rex Reeds and Roger Eberts and viewed and wrote about movies with a depth and clarity that seemed super-human. And smart as hell.This movie has fooled many into thinking it is somehow clever, beautiful and enlightening.  I could not find one less-than-amazed review at Rottentomatoes.com from writers that shoud know better. But friend, think about it just a little bit, how this movies titillates mentally-restful viewers by using the cheapest of devices; by baring the breasts of doe-eyed 15 year olds -  friggin' kiddie porn in 2 scenes no less!  And the protagonist's spiritual awakening consists of smoking pot, working at a fast food joint (with a cliched smiley face logo), driving a hot cherry-red Pontiac and having sex with a 15 year old (which is a crime in the US, ja? no?).Kevin Spacey's original and complex-toned smart-assiness is entertaining and the young girl players are fascinating and beautiful.  Annette Bening, given a straw woman stereotype role that begs to be burned, in the course of 6 seconds still manages to move us in the finale.Another Amazon reviewer cited Ray Lawrence's Austrailian film from 1987, BLISS as the misinterpreted and maladapted source material for American Beauty.  Having seen BLISS several times, and being a huge fan of that movie, I think he is correct.  Written by Alan Ball, a TV sitcom writer, this film pushes a screwed-up message.

R331GGU60G7JI1,"It came damaged. I blame part of that on the seller and the other part on the manufacturer. The shelves were not separated by anything, so they rubbed the paint off in some spots, the manufacturer should pack it better.The mesh shelf was bend, and the box looked crushed a bit. It wasn't amazon delivery, because the amazon box was fine, just the product box was in bad shape.The top and bottom shelves hold the legs in place. The 4 middle shelves are optional. But they are NOT removable. I have a wire shelf with removable trays, and this is not like that at all. All the shelves slide in from the back, and not the front, and then the back has a bar to keep the shelves from sliding out backward (gravity would pull them out).The top and bottom shelves have backs that are angled correctly. The middle shelves have backs that are not angled correctly. The backs stick out the back of the rack. So the bar that goes on the back cannot mount correctly. By pushing on the bar hard enough to bend the shelf backs, and then cross threading the screw, it went together.I chose this rack because it was the tallest I could find (under 24 inches). But I would not buy again. If this was a 1-time mistake, hopefully, someone will reach out and send me a replacement. But I suspect they are all made this way.I gave it 2 stars because once together, it's fairly solid.  There is a fair bit of tension on that cross threaded screw I could only get 1 turn on.

R183J2XL4783KN,"I bought the HP ""3 ink cartridge"" in July 2020.  I did not need the magenta cartridge until October 2020 (I had previously used the cyan and yellow cartridges and they worked normally).  The product expiration date is 01/2022.  At first I could not get the cartridge to work at all, even after re-seating it numerous times.  I called Amazon customer support and was informed that their warranty is for 30 days, but that HP would cover the warranty.  I called HP customer support and was told that they do not warranty ink cartridges that are not sold by HP, and that Amazon is responsible.  I called back Amazon.  Of course when I re-seated the cartridge again while on the phone call, my printer 'recognized' it and I was able to print.  The color is not normal, but it is 'red'.  So at that point I dropped the issue with Amazon, who was nothing but helpful.  This review is to let you know that if you buy HP ink on Amazon and do not try ALL the cartridges within 30 days, and try to get satisfaction from HP, they will NOT cover the warranty even though it is a genuine HP product sold by Amazon.  I did end up buying, 1-day delivery, an 'off-brand' set of ink cartridges from Amazon (manufacturer: iKong) so that my printer would at least print (it will not print at all unless ALL the cartridges are full enough) while I was awaiting an outcome on the HP ink cartridge, which I could NOT get in 1-day.

R3NEYMAAJTY7J,"Several other reviewers have found this book to be interesting and entertaining up until the climax.  I didn't make it nearly that far before my interest died.  The original plot device - a chess puzzle - is well developed, and its solution is crafted in a way that is appropriately intriguing - translucent, if you will, rather than either transparent or opaque.  But once that solution is revealed, about half way through the book, the implausible plot becomes wholly unbelievable, and distractingly so.  The characters, drawn so broadly as to also be unbelievable, never generate any sympathy or hatred.  The author ponders the mysteries of life ponderously, his musings more notable for their attempt at sophisticated style than for any insights relevant to the plot or players.

R3LY2I9G1ZV23I,"I will confess up front that I read this book while sitting in the cafe at Barnes and Nobles, unwilling to spend my own money.First, rather than addressing the book, I will address the reviews, since they seem to represent a completely different series than I have read. It is obvious that this book will be popular with the neo-revisionist Southerners and ""unReconstructed and unrepetatant Rebels"" (like the Sons of Confederate Veterans) that continue to foster the myth of the ""Glorious Cause"" under the ""Stainless Banner"". The truth is that the Southern rebellion was a horrible attempt to destroy the United States by a privileged elite that wanted to protect and perpetuate slavery as a political, economic, cultural and social institution, one that underpinned the ""Southern"" way of life.A vignette in the second book of the series clearly illustrates that slavery WAS the CENTRAL issue of this war. Judah Benjamin is trying to persuade Jefferson Davis to free the slaves, or at least recruit from them with a promise of freedom. He tries to enlist Lee's support in this effort, but fails on both accounts with the obdurate Davis and the quiescent Lee. Judah Benjamin, the ""despised Jew"" (he called much worse by papers in the South), sees the moral imperative and military necessity of freeing the slaves, of ending the South's ""peculiar institution"", yet Lee's moral coeardice and Davis' ""prinicpled"" stand show that the Southern leadership understood that the existence of slavery was the rational for the existence of the Confederacy. Without slavery, there would be no Confederacy. One of the major blows to Confederate morale and one of the major reasons its citizens finally decided to stop fighting for it, was the decision to recruit slaves as combat soldiers and promise them their freedom in 1865. It is indicative of the inflexibility of Southern leadership that they could not see that slavery was not actually needed to support the continued oppression of black Americans in the South, politically, socially, culturally and economically, was shown by the successful application of ""Jim Crow"" in the ""New South"" from the late 1870's. As far as God being at the center of Southern society, the rebellion was declared by Jefferson Davis and Alexander Stephens as a ""revolution"", to establish a ""white, Christian Nation"". The African-American was to be kept in perpetual subservience and subordination, as his due place in God's plan. Southerners were so Christian and close to God, that in the 1860 Census, 15% of the nearly 4 million slaves and the 350,000 free blacks in the South (Frederick Douglas and W.E.B. DuBois were part of the latter group) were identified as mixed race, the result of white Christian masters imposing their sexual needs on female slaves. One young white wife complained to her Baptist minister about her husband's forays among the slaves and wanted to know if she could divorce him, and was told that this was God's Will and to accept her place. It was God's Will that the ""Moral"" Christian southerners could see slavery as a means of converting blacks to Christianity to save their souls (which meant they were human beings), while treating them as furniture, tools or farm animals to be bought and sold, without reference to their desires and family connections (another demonstration of the long Southern interest in family values).  An aside of the manpower equation. Keep in mind that of the over one million Southern white males that fought in the Civil War, 25% fought for the United States. And of over 200,000 blacks that fought in the War, over 90% fought for the Union. The white Southerners who fought in blue came from the areas of the South where there were few or no slaves, like western North Carolina, eastern Tennessee, northern Alabama, northern Arkansas and southern Missouri. Slavery was indeed the central cause and issue of the war. It is indicative of the moral bankruptcy of the Southern leadership that they would accept help from France, which was engaged in a major violation of the Monroe Doctrine, on the condition that the French would be able to sustain their oppression of the Mexican people through a foreign monarch, supported by a conservative, Catholic minority, that supplanted a democratically elected government through force  As far as the books' military value as alternate history, there are significant problems.  1) On 1 July 1863, Lee had concentrated his Army, keeping him from foraging and feeding it. He had seven days of food in his wagons and on his men to conduct operations that would bring the Army of the Potomac to battle, or he would have to retreat behind the mountains into the Valley to re-establish contact with his line of communications. He could not just live off Union supply convoys, because there weren't any. Meade had redirected his lines of communications back to Baltimore through Westminster. In fact, he received no re-supply from Washington, DC at all, from 28 June until 7 July. Meade himself did not receive any supplies from Westminster until 4 July. Lee had sufficient artillery ammuntion to conduct a single offensive battle. He received no re-supply until after 7 July. Thus, if he did not succeed in destroying the Army of the Potomac in his initial operations, he would have to pull back to re-establish his supply lines and, until he did, fight a purely defensive campaign. Lee had no cavalry available in the vicinity of Gettysburg, while Meade had three brigades to his south and rear able to scout Lee's movements. Meade was on interior lines, and the center of mass of his Army on 1 July was closer to Washington, DC then Lee's. He had equal operational speed to Lee, which meant he could get to any point between Gettysburg/Taneytown and Washington in strength before Lee. Finally his orders were to ""cover Washington"". It was expected that he would forestall Lee or come up on him at the same time, should Lee attack Washington. There was no requirement for Meade to attack Lee in a defensive position unless Lee was directly threatening Washington, which couldn't be done from a defensive position. Meade could keep Lee concentrated, unable to forage, until Lee was forced to move back towards the Valley to re-supply. In any case, Meade twice during the aftermath of Gettysburg showed the moral courage not to attack a prepared Lee, once at Falling Waters and once at Mine Run. At neither time was he relieved of command. Finally, it just wasn't that Meade was a competent and steady commander, far better than what he is portrayed in the first book, but the Army of the Potomac, at that point in time, reached its apex as an operational force. It constantly surprised Lee with the speed of its marches and its resilence on the battlefield. It should be remembered that while Meade may have outnumbered Lee during the three days of battle, he still had over 10,000 fresh, uncommitted infantry on the afternoon of 3 July 1863. The combat effectiveness of the two armies was almost equal, such that the great victories Lee scores in these novels were historically impossible. Second, the war was lost and won in the West. The books only marginally pay attention to this central fact. If Lee was winning victories in the East because he was re-inforced, the Union was winning victories in the West for that same reason. By the end of the second book, we could expect Rosecrans to have captured Chattanooga, Sherman to have marched past Jackson on the way to Montgomery, while rolling over Joe Johnston and brushing aside Forrest, while Banks had landed at Mobile. By the middle of the final book, Atlanta should have fallen, Banks would be occupying Savannah, Sherman half way to Charleston and Rosecrans clearing out eastern Tennessee. While Jeff Davis and Lee were running around south central Pennsylvania and Maryland, the Union was conquering the South out from under them. The books in many ways are interesting, and often well written, but the basis of their stories are militarily implausible and superficial.PS. A small error, but irritating for a historian. The 5th Michigan Cavalry carried Spencer rifles, along with part of the 6th Michigan, during the Gettysburg campaign.PSS. I would refer readers to the latest revisionist biographies of Lee that show his support and embrace of slavery as the proper condition for African-Americans and his complicity in the collection of blacks during the Gettysburg campaign and his refusal to treat captured black Union Soldiers as POWs IAW the Confederacy's policy of considering them as escaped slaves in armed rebellion.",0,0,0,0

R1549IUV2GOD4R,I should have read the reviews first! After only a few days of use this pen looks like it is already running out of ink- it does not flow or glide well. In some cases the ink is so faint that I cannot read my writing.  The grip is comfortable but it is still hard to see what I am writing which as left handers know is a big issue. I would not buy this again.EDITED: the cap does not stay on AT ALL and there is no clip to pin the pen onto a notebook or piece of paper.,0,0,0,0
R2BHJG5Z0IIXRW,"Bought this unit for my Mother as a gift sometime ago and within six months it stopped working all together!Whats ironic about this unit is that whoever sets it up (me for example) it only works for! Giving this as a gift it was annoying when it only would recognize things (which it barely did) from my own voice versus my Mothers voice which it had an extremely hard time doing. The lists were ok but they never were that useful to be honest. Also it takes WAY MORE TIME to actually create a list than to write it down.The real reason why I give this a two star rating (and believe me that is generous) is because when you purchase this item it comes with batteries, and for a couple bucks more and so I thought piece of mind i bought the extended warranty. To my dismay the unit stopped working (reasons unknown) and the batteries that were included in the box leaked causing more concern. Upon calling the company to complain and try and get a replacement i find out that battery leakage is not covered by the warranty even if they supplied them, also the replacement fix fee was almost as much as the product to begin with.Needless to say Brookstone and there products lack quality and in my opinion are one heck of a scam company. Will never recommend or buy another product from there again! Do yourself a favor and write down your own lists and save the headache and money!",0,0,0,0
R3R78EIMWPUNR2,"As a perpetually single, 35 year old man with a bad habit of moving all over the country every couple of years, I have never seen a reason to buy a full sized washer. When my trust Magic Chef portable washer have it on me after 4 years, I was looking for a reasonably priced alternative to a full size unit. This one advertised a .2 cu ft lower capacity for a reasonable price, so I thought I would try it out. I am now regretting that decision.The first thing I noticed was the size is significantly smaller. The advertised space is about 90% of my old washer, but I struggle to fit a weeks worth of shirts in it, while I never had a problem with my old machine. I have concerns about what would happen if I tried to put a comforter in this one.The second thing I noticed was the smell. It gives off a very industrial smell whenever I use it. I hope that this will go away in time, and I haven't noticed this small on my clothes, but it makes my laundry room stink whenever I use it.The last big thing I have noticed is the spin cycle is so weak, it is almost useless. I have taken things out, and they are still dripping wet. So wet that I can wring them out with little effort. I was accustomed to my old machine, where things came out very dry. At the end, on that machine, the spin cycle stopped working, and things came out of it only a little wetter then they come out of this one. You can see how much water is left after a normal cycle in the picture. It is a little hard to see, but there is about a a cup of water in the drum on the right. Edit 10/12/2022 I was able to solve this problem by putting the machine on top of a rack. Apparently the water drainage pump is not strong enough to lift the drain water to a standard laundry hookup height, so putting it on the rack has solved that problem. Clothes still come out wetter then I would like, but better. This is a fatal flaw in my opinion, considering I had to spend an additional $80 for a sturdy enough rack on which to put this. I really wish I had spent that extra $80 on a better machine. Dropping a three star rating to a one star.Ultimately, in another year or so I will hopefully be moving overseas for work, so this will do until then. But I will be glad to turn my back on it when that time comes.",0,0,0,0

Otherwise, it is a classic example of ""paradigm paralysis"" from the first words.  The author's biases are clear from the beginning and by the end, it's even clearer --  the author even admits her behavior is part of her ""B#%##"" personality which interestingly corresponds to a possible aspect of her type.While the author lists extensive references at the end, the book is filled with comments and ""interpretations"" of many communications that leave me wondering ""where's the evidence of this?""  So many examples, including the author's interpretation of the thinking portrayed by a photograph -- a photograph where the expressions could be interpreted in many different ways.The book wanders back and forth with a confusing timeline that had me frequently trying to figure out the when of a particular part of the story.While statistical validity -- which others claim the book ignores in today's version of the MBTI -- has its place, the author fails to recognize ""face validity.""  Participants of the MBTI today see the instrument as reflecting choices they make -- and they validate the results by the importance of ""verifying"" the results.  The author's arrogance in sarcastically calling the  MBTI a ""test"" during her prejudiced attendance at a certification session was just one of many statements that tarnished the book.",0,0,0,0

First I played it with the sound coming through the speakers on my TV, which normally sound great. I watched the last of another concert DVD before inserting this, and the other one sounded fabulous.

The concept is good but the printer itself just hasn't delivered.  I'm not that picky but this thing can't function as good as a $50 throw away printer.Update 3.21.16 my review to Epson:Everything works great except the printing. (This is a printer after all) . Wifi, Lan, ADF, Scan to email, all wonderful. This printer was first purchased when it was new technology. (Oct 2014)  We use this printer in a small business environment but we are on our 4th replacement from Epson and now Epson refuses to work with us.  Out of warranty.  My main complaint is misaligned text and lines through text. This has been a common theme with this printer.  I've run countless nozzle cleanings and alignments but to no avail.  I use genuine Epson ink and staples general printer paper.  So there is no mystery there.  The printer is in a closed office with two office managers and a controlled climate.

R2KB1KBVND0W6I,"Warning: spoilers belowI was so looking forward to finally seeing Midnight in Paris, after I had read and heard so much about it. I found it a disappointment, mainly because it was just what I had expected and nothing more. There is so much more to the real Paris, not just the standard sights and conceptions and obsessions with impressionism, post-impressionism, the early modern writings of Americans who went to Paris to write and drink during Prohibition. All the cliches are there and there is nothing new, not even the concept of falsely worshipping the past. The past is distorted here in so many ways. First, just when in the 1920s is that part of the film set? Fitzgerald, Hemingway (did he really talk like that?), Picasso, Bunuel, Degas, Matisse, Modigliani, Dali, Josephine Baker and just about everyone else Woody Allen could come up with in the film and all at the same time in that decade:  oh look, there's so and so and then there's so and so. The female extras wear styles of the early 20s, all except for the childish character of Marion Cotillard who wishes only to go back to La Belle Epoque. She isn't even wearing an authentic late-20s dress, it's too short (again a false cliche) and is really something from today (today being defined as the still-1960s lasting 40 years after its zenith). The 1890s folk at Maxims (Degas, was it?) comment on how pretty the dress was -- she would have been arrested or at least asked to leave Maxims for wearing it then. Instead she's offered a designing job. After all, didn't she assist Chanel thirty years in the future? And do we always need a cliche cancan? And what is with that hearse that comes to pick little Marion up? How were her memoirs published and why? That may be the low point of the movie. I was embarrassed for Cotillard because she had been so wonderful as Edith Piaf and she ends up in this junk. And the tune Parlez-moi d'amour played repeatedly at the end ... it was written in 1930 (look it up on Wikipedia). Now for Owen Wilson, who acts here so much like Woody Allen himself that he must be his alter ego. Wilson says in the Cannes interview on the disc that Allen left him alone to develop his own character. That is so hard to believe because he is imitating Woody Allen, with his whining and and confusion. This mirror portrayal is really spooky. Also, why do later disc boxes replace the Paris sky shown at first with Van Gogh's Starry Night and then add Rachel McAdams to Wilson's stroll along the Seine? Is she such a big star that Wilson needs her to sell the story? Allen said he wanted her because she was so beautiful and, oh year, also, a good actress, as is Wilson. If they truly are so great, it doesn't show up here. Her parents were the obnoxious right-wing cliches. Carla Bruni is a stick, physically and in her ""acting"". Pure vanity. Kathy Bates' Gertrude Stein was the highlight of the film, as she often is, and lent a little class to this mess.",0,0,0,0

It's neither a meta encyclopedia nor do I by the concept of an ""in-world"" book.

Back then I thought how cool and thoughtful all of that fake history, mythology and worldbuilding was. Reading the stuff now it is just embarrassingly bad. To my big dissapointment, TWOIAF gives me the exact same feeling. This Series deserves much better.Instead of raising ASOIAF onto the levels of Tolkien's or Herbert's worldbuilding, this world book exactly achieves the contrary, throwing it back to Dungeons and Dragons Levels. I mostly blame the bad writing in many parts and the silly execution as ""in world"" book. The idea is not bad per se but IMO it simply doesnt work here.",0,0,0,0

R1BVAOOW9JGDDJ,"If you need just the occasional paper trimming, this cutter will do the job. This unit is EXTREMELY light weight, the plastic thin and it has nowhere near the sturdiness or heft of other Fiskar paper trimmers (the rotary styles). Also, the swing arm that has measurements on it is difficult to read accurately; because it is not even with the ""bed"" of the unit, the paper being cut actually 'floats' about 1/8 inch above the measurement scale, making it harder to accurately read where you are. I attempted to cut an 8 1/2 inch X 11 inch sheet of paper exactly in half...the shadow cast by the paper and the fact that the paper is not lying directly on top of the scale put the cut off by 1/8""-1/16"". The cutter itself worked beautifully, giving a crisp, clean edge.I can see what others have reported about the cutter potentially abraiding the guide wire - it sounds like a violin string when I shunt the cutter head back and forth, from the vibrations of the wire (I haven't used it enough to experience what some have...the wire breaking completely). If you decide to get this unit, I'd recommend that you be sure to press DOWN on the cutter head, not putting any lateral pressure on it, so it is less likely to rub so hard against the guide wire.Years ago I purchased a full-size Fiskars rotary paper cutter; it's substantially heavier than this unit, has a full-sized graph-scored bed and a rotary blade. I find the insert cutting mat portion of the trimmer dulls the blades quickly and needs replacing often. It is, however, amazingly accurate in measuring for cuts. It is also harder to store, more awkward to get out for a few quick paper cuts and does not transport well. This unit being reviewed is compact enough that it could be kept handy in a desk drawer (a long desk drawer...you'll need a little over 15"" depth), but be careful not to store other, heavy items on top of it. The plastic is light enough that too much weight or stress on it could easily break the plastic or the cutter arm. The cutter does a good job cutting through a single or a couple sheets of paper or tag board, but you may need to measure with a separate ruler and mark the cut line.Bottom line: if you have a need for LOTS of paper trimming, get a heavier cutter. If you only occasionally cut a few sheets and would like something small enough to be kept handy plus you appreciate the price difference (larger rotary models are now running over $50, compared to about $17 for this unit), then this model may do well enough. 2 1/2 stars.",0,0,0,0
RKQGXADK1PRXE,"Dune: House Atreides is one of the most disappointing works I have had the misfortune to read.Within the first quarter of the book, it was obvious that the book would be inferior.  By halfway, anyone could see that all the characters 'thought' alike.  They were cartoonish villains or naive youths.  By 3/4 done, the book had so offended me that I called the person who recommended it, and every other Dune fan I knew, and ranted about it's inadequacies.  I finished this book solely so that I could write a review that expressed a fraction of my disgust.Previously-known intelligent characters blurt out their plans for no apparent reason.  As many main characters from the original Dune as possibly COULD meet DO so.  The Emperor is characterized as a bumbling twit, Fenring is a murderous punk, the Bene Gesserit are believers in (rather than manipulators of) religion, and that is only the tip of the pestilential iceberg that is House Atreides.The author has displayed for us that 1)He does not understand his father's works, 2) He lacks the intelligence to design believable plots, and 3) He lacks the humanity to create believable characters.I would not recommend buying this book, even were it sold for 25 cents in a used bookstore, and came with a pack of gum.",0,0,0,0

However, by Christmas morning when my daughter opened it, the ink had again leaked, leaving a mess. My product suggestion here is to use a better quality container, but with ink I would think that should be fairly obvious.

The ratings skew high, but all the most-helpful reviews are one or two stars: a telling sign.(I'm really shocked at all the five-star reviews.

Check.Protagonist saved from certain doom at the hands of evil forces by deus ex machina? Check, check, check, check, check. (Yes: that repeatedly. It's like this is the only plot device the author knew.)Protagonist captured by evil forces, but freed by even more unlikely rescuers? Check, check. (A slight variation on the theme.)Then you add in the dozens of internal inconsistencies (dragons as large as hills somehow wiped out by 13 evil knight/wizards in the space of about forty years; 12 of the 13 evil knights killed ""mostly"" by at best semi-competent rebels in the next forty; chief evil bad guy needs protagonist because with ""one more"" by his side he would be unstoppable... this is the tip of the iceberg) and you've barely recovered from the last insult to your intelligence before the next one knocks you reeling.The quality of the writing and dialog is as poor as I can remember. Everyone is angry or impatient with everyone else, and this is told us rather than shown. New York Times bestseller? Seriously?I was stuck on an airplane so I finished it more out of morbid curiosity than anything else.

R3OKLZ85YMKMHZ,"It's not a completely bad chair, but it does have its drawbacks.  I needed a sturdy, cheap chair for a basement office space, and from the pics and reviews this looked like it would work.  Everything arrived perfectly -- no problems with packaging, all of the parts were there, etc., although it had a strange smell to it, but I guess that's to be expected since some of the chair is actually vinyl.  Assembly was not that great of an experience -- some of the instructions were a little misleading, but worse than that, it took an incredible amount of time to get the bolts from the arms to connect through the leather (i think this part is actually leather) and padding to nut.  It was very frustrating -- I really had to play around with it to get it to connect.  Once everything is assembled, the chair is actually quite comfortable.  However, it is cheaply made.  For example, the back rest cushion is actually fairly crooked -- its sewn on and has a noticeable incline looking at it head-on.  The structure of the chair itself seems sturdy, but i have my doubts about the leather lasting for any long period of time -- it's definitely not the highest quality, even for bonded leather.My biggest problem with this chair, and why I gave it 2 stars instead of 3, is actually something that I think is a little dangerous. If you use this chair, be warned that you really should wear shoes that protect the back of your ankles.  I'm sure that sounds strange in a review for a chair, but the metal base is incredibly sharp where it extends over the wheels.  I've knocked the back of my ankles into it a number of times, and it hurt.  A lot.  On one occasion I hit hard enough that it actually drew a little blood.  I'm sure I could put duct take on it to fix the sharpness, but after spending $200 on it, I would think I should expect a chair that isn't trying to hobble me.",0,0,0,0

Initial quality review? 5-Star, without a doubt.BUT! Within only 4 days of using them (I bought 36 bulbs in total, and have 30 installed), 4 of the bulbs have started flickering. 3 of those 4 started flickering from one ""light rod/diode"" to another. I assumed my fixtures were wired incorrectly. Before removing the entire fixture, I simply put a new bulb into the flickering socket. Perfect. No flickering. I put the flickering bulb into another socket. It still flickered the same way.While I love the bulbs, $14.66 is a lot of money to spend on one bulb that only lasts a few days. The bulbs came in packs of three, but as each fixture has 3 bulbs (and I installed from the same box for each individual fixture), I'm sure I didn't simple have a ""bad box"". I'm worried that EVERY OTHER BULB will start ""death-flickering"", and I'll be out a lot of money for bulbs I thought would last me decades. Buyer beware.

R3SXRVJCR3X0PY,"After reading the first two books (and associated shorts) of the series, I was definitely looking forward to ""Daylight War"".What a let down. The latest entry from Peter Brett is a big disappointment in a bunch of ways. From plot, to characterization, to writing. In nearly every way, the book is worse than its predecessors, and left me scratching my head.The most glaring weakness of all however was the absence of a strong editor's hand. The book is simply too long. The first 75% could have been cut by more than half, and the story would have been stronger for it. Very little happens until far too late in the novel. Worse, the ""story"" is filled with juvenile and stereotyped depictions of women, sexuality, and relationships. It reads like the very worst of Robert Jordan (absent only hand-wringing) or what I would imagine the Twilight series to contain (I haven't read it!) if it were slightly less YA oriented.Beyond this another major source of irritation, noted by other reviewers, is the degradation in the intelligence and vocabulary of Arlen. No longer appearing educated, and uttering ""Ent"" rather than  ""is not"" in every sentence it seems, he is now a full fledged hillbilly demon killer. It just rings false based on what he has done and experienced in previous novels. Leesha paper likewise becomes dumber and less sympathetic, as does Enevera. Overall, there is little to like or relate to in any of the major characters.Just as troubling is the lack of comment by anybody but Leesha on the horrendously sexist society of the Southerners. Rape and virtual enslavement is depicted as banal. But the lack of reflection or judgement on these practices by nearly anybody is mystifying at best. Even the authorial presence seemingly cant get worked up enough to colour the passages involving these practices with much more than casual disinterest.And the writing too seems to have suffered for some reason. Except for brief passages at the end of the book, the text has none of the pace or compelling and quick moving prose of Brett's earlier works. It is largely lethargic. Particularly in the first half of the novel, the writing reads like that of a slightly bored historian relating distant events, rather than something current and compelling. And the point of view switches so many times that any forward momentum is lost--not too mention any interest in the lives of the characters or their dilemmas.2 stars and not 1 only because the last 10% slightly redeems the novel, with much faster pacing and far more action. But for those of us waiting for a another strong work like the Warded Man from Brett... well, we will have to keep waiting.",0,0,0,0

R15ZXP1D16T4F9,"Okay, I'll write the good part of the review first:The good thing about this book is that it's quite impressive for a girl approximately my age to write this, almost as though a mature adult has composed this story. I admire her creativity at making Life and Death as sisters, but that's it. That's the only good thing about this book.Now the bad part (I hope my friend can forgive me for writing this review):I am unimpressed by her unoriginal plot, of evil trying to rule the world, and then there's only a one person (in this case, 4 people, and they are Jade, Opal, Amber, and the Chosen One, who's real name is Elyador) who can save the world. Lalala, how many times do we have to hear ""The destiny of the world rests in the hands of so-and-so""? I think we've had enough of cheesy lines. And there's the stereotypical characters: Jade, the snobby, gorgeous rich girl; Amber, the sweet, ravishing peasant girl; and Opal, the cold-hearted, quiet, but a girl with the beauty of a porcelain doll. For Pete's sake, do they ALL have to be pretty? It makes people who aren't pretty feel terrible and ashmaed of their looks! We've had enough of stick-thin and gorgeous girls in the media, like movies, music (lovely singers), commercials, magazines, celebrities, AND NOW WE DON'T NEED IT IN BOOKS!!! And the girls, they have to be so perfect, it makes me sick. Jade and Opal makes me sick! Jade is incredibly arrogant and stuck up, that it makes me want to give her a good chiding. Opal, OMIGOD, Flavia Bujor NEVER EVER explains why she's so cold-hearted and indifferent, and never cares for anyone! Her unkindness disgusts me. Amber...well, she's better than Jade and Opal, but she also gets pretty aggravating. The author describes things as though she's been in a rush (do we know what Fairyland even looks like? What about the geography? Are there lush forests; towering, rocky mountains; giant meadows with blooming flowers healthily growing everywhere? What's the weather and climate like? Is it hot? Is it cold? Is it windy? Is the place ever humid?). Dialogue is often quite childish, and our heroines bicker as though they were immature children on an elementary school playground. And OH...MY...GOD...what's with falling in love at first sight???? I mean, Opal just looks at Adrien, and bam! She's in love! What, did cupid shoot her or something? I don't think so! And when Opal pleads for mercy to the soldiers of Darkness (the soldiers of Darkness, oh, that's just the most original thing I've ever heard of), she gets skewered, and then Adrien just comes running to her and trying to rescue her, going, ""I LOVE HER!!!!!! MY ONE TRUE LOVE!!!"" (he didn't really say that, just so you know), but alas, Opal dies. Then he carries her in his arms and acts all sulky and moans, and I don't feel a bit of sympathy for him. Love at first sight only works in classic Disney movies, but never in anything else.Now, my other gargantuan complaint is her repulsive stereotypes. Like, the good is called Light, and the bad is called Dark. WHAT'S WITH BEING BAD EQUALS DARKNESS?????? OMIGOD, excuse me??? I'm dark, but I don't mean the kind of stereotypical darkness with me being all lonely, wanting to murder the innocent, having a mental disorder, being evil, things like that. To me, darkness is often merely misunderstood. I can see the beauty of darkness, and it's NOTHING like how Flavia Bujor portrays the darkness. When I imagine darkness, yes there is black. But I imagine a wide range of emotions and artistic values, which can be shared with the light (which I find is also nothing like how Flavia portrays in this sappy girly-fantasy novel). Death is involved, but it's a part of life. I see sensitivity, but darkness is a mysterious beauty, and I love it. But can Flavia see the good side of darkness? Noooooooooooooo, because all she can say is that darkness is evil, and light is much better than it. Has she ever heard of the yin and yang symbol? Light is balanced with darkness. They both need each other. Without darkness, light is nothing. Without light, darkness is nothing. And why is it always the black-haired people that has to be considered ugly in these sappy stories? It's always like that! In fairy tales, it's always the light-haired girls who are good, and dark-haired girls who are mean (think of Cinderella, the Goose Girl, the Little Mermaid, blah blah blah). Jade is black-haired, and she's shown as a snobby girl, and one who is supposed to convince her two other friends to die. Lots of people in Ms. Bujor's ""Army of Darkness"" has black hair.Overall, this is an okay book. You might like it, you might not like it, I don't care. It's not worth my money. I'm grateful that my library has this book and that I never have to buy it with my own money. But it's better than a lot of other books (Gossip Girls, Avon Romance, etc.), but it's not movie-quality or anything.",0,0,0,0
R2KEPFOBMPGS9E,"Here WE GO AGAIN, she TRICKED her FANS YET AGAIN! Great first 3 SINGLES & everything else is WAYYYYY BELOW AVERAGE! Just a DOWN RIGHT AWFUL ALBUM!!!!!!Beyonce is one of the few artist in R&B that seems to have striked an addiction with fans around the world. She is also one of the few acts where i feel people will run out to buy her CD even if you're not a huge R&B fan. I do find her as a SINGER to be very interesting and i like her voice and ENERGY. But i don't like her during interviews because she talks really slow and sometimes so SLOW that she actually makes the interviewer forget what question he initially asked her. That's how long it takes her to answer questions on live TV interviews. She is so powerful at answering slow that she can literally throw you off of track from the main topic. WOW!! With that being said i like her as an artist and she has a fascinating & powerful voice. Deja Vu is a great lead off single but it's basically the sequel to Crazy In Love. On top of that she is yelling & SCREAMING when the song just started. GURL wait till the end, your not Deborah Cox. She must have thought that's what her FANS wanted to hear. All the yelling actually just gets annoying after awhile. Real BORED real FAST! Her 2nd single was a great track but once again a lot of yelling. Overall i still enjoyed it because it was something different that i didn't expect from her. 3rd singles was either Upgrade U or Irreplaceable which are both great songs but not sure which one came out 1st. I didn't even expect a 2nd album from Beyonce to come so soon. But she is FIESTY and wants to keep her REIGN of SUPREME to stay on TOP FOREVER! Every other song on the album is a DUD! I didn't expect a stellar album but she's a commercial artist so i expected at least 5 good songs on this album as i did with the 1st one. All I got again was 3 worthy tracks worthy of being mentioned. 1 star for 3 great singles and nothing else. On top of that she had the NERVE to release an album only containing 10 songs. 10 songs do not make an album and 9 songs with 2 interludes do not make an album. So Cassie if you're reading this that's directed towards you! The last thing is Beyonce has the NERVE to re-release the album with extra songs that should have been including in the original. You're not Mariah Carey OK!!!!!! Beautiful Liar would have saved this album from its HARSH reviews if it was released when the initial album came out. Instead she has to re-release and charge extra for stuff the fans already have. And the re-release has like 20 different versions of Beautiful Liar. I do give her credit for being one of the few R&B singers that can keep the attention of music lovers and the way certain other artist just can't. But behind the IMAGE laid an AWFUL ALBUM!!!!!",0,0,0,0

R36PXECGQQKAZG,"A friend of mine loaned me his copy of ""Daredevil"" a little while back, and I was actually quite excited to watch it.  I knew next to nothing about Daredevil, save that he was blind and that his other senses worked extra-well to compensate for that fact ... beyond that, I was totally in the dark.  I had recently come off of seeing a pair of comic book adaptations not too long before trying out this one: the excellent ""X2: X-Men United"" and the pretty good-but-not-quite-as-much-fun ""Hulk"", so I was pretty sure I would enjoy this one too.  I was sadly mistaken.To be fair, this film did have a couple things going for it, though one of them is admittedly entirely subjective.  First off, I was interested immediately by the use of Roman Catholicism in relation to the main character.  To be clear, this both interested me and set me on edge ... while I appreciated seeing a character in a movie have the Faith play a notable role in his life, just as it does with mine, it also set me on edge ... I didn't want the church to be portrayed in the wrong way, as it tends to be in movies that I have seen (not in the fact that the Church is insulted, but that the writers' understanding of the Church is sometimes mistaken on a particular point or attitude, which leads to the Church not being properly represented.  I felt the same way when I saw Nightcrawler praying the rosary in ""X2"".  Gladly, I had nothing to worry about from him, and Nightcrawler definitely came out as my favorite character of that film).  I felt the Church itself to be well represented in this film ... Daredevil's actions contrary to her teachings, such as the things he does motivated by revenge, were his own choices.  Good enough for me.There were two more things I liked about this film, which helps to merit it two stars rather than just one.  First, the whole childhood of Matt Murdock/origin story episode of the film was enjoyable.  Second, I have to say that Colin Ferrell stole the show as the villainous Bullseye, hamming it up to a most entertaining degree and becoming a true bright spot amid the mindless chaos which surrounded him.  If he had been the star, I would never have considered the movie to be a perfect one, but it would have still been incredibly fun to watch ... like seeing a movie just about the Kurgan from ""Highlander""!Now that I've got the good things out of the way, let's take a look at the stuff I remembered most: the bad.First off, there's our main characters.  Murdock and Elektra have got to have the worst possible scenes together out of any cinematic couple I've seen in recent history.  Their meeting in the coffee shop or wherever it is is just awful (and he comes off looking like a major creep, if you ask me), and their little fight on the playground was downright embarrassing (made even worse by the awful one-liners they were forced to spout).  Things don't get any better, and there was certainly no sympathy to be found from me when Elektra ... well, let's not spoil it for those who have not yet seen the movie (though I should still tell you not to bother).I was majorly bewildered and frustrated by Murdock's confession scene after he had 'a bit of fun' with Elektra.  It's one thing not to confess something you aren't sorry for, but if you aren't ... well, shouldn't you be telling the priest about that?  I find it truly distressing that he could be such good friends with a priest and so familiar with the Church and all her practices/disciplines/beliefs and not mention or even think twice about that little detail.  If he had been a non-religious character I wouldn't have given this matter a second thought.What else is wrong with this movie?  There's the awful music (I eagerly await the day when the world realizes that rap is cra ... crud and stop subjecting us to it), hearing the phrase ""lawyer by day ..."" repeated over and over ad nauseum, the incredible stunts that Daredevil is able to pull off (I actually had to double-check and make sure that he didn't have other superpowers besides his hyperactive senses) ...  If that's really true, I'd like to be able to jump off of buildings the same way he does, and a heck of a lot more.""Daredevil"" was a complete waste of time, and has soured me from seeing any more comic book adaptations until the third ""X-Men"" film comes out in a year or two.  You know it's a bad sign when you find yourself rooting for the bad guy, which we all know will only result in disappointment if we do.  If you haven't seen this yet, give it a miss and do something else, like go to the library or clean your bathroom sink.  You'll have a better time of it, and if you knew what you were missing you would thank me.Carry on Carry on,MN",0,0,0,0
R3L0NFCYXMB6P,"Bed frame is sturdy and easy to assemble. The mattress I purchase to go on this frame specifically says to use slats that are no further than 4"" apart.

Instead it came with 10 slats that are 4.25-4.5"" apart (held together with Velcro). I realized this after it was fully assembled!

R1JJCZ28FUS4JR,"I don't like writing a negative review because I'm a big fan of Amazon and I certainly don't blame Amazon for this disappointing printer.  I blame Lexmark.  After living with this printer for several months I've decided to ditch it and get one from another well-known manufacturer who I trust and have a good history with (and I should have never abandoned them even temporarily to have a fling with this Lexmark piece of junk).I wouldn't even feel good about giving this printer away for free.  It would simply frustrate and annoy whoever I gave it to.I don't care how inexpensive the ink cartridges are, this printer/scanner has been nothing but grief for us since we got it.  I can't comment on the FAX capability since we never used it.Printer:  color ink runs out FAST.  Printed pages often have white streaks in them.  Printer takes a long time to warm up and is very noisy and ""dramatic"" when it's been sitting idle for a while and then you dare ask it to actually print something.  This printer has also let me down at critical times by running out of ink right when I needed it most, in spite of the fact that the estimated ink remaining display showed over 75% ink remaining.Scanner: the scanner feed mechanism is cheap trash.  It jams far more than it feeds.  Had to use the manual flatbed scanning technique 99% of the time, which is very tedious.  This model doesn't allow you to scan in legal size documents or really anything much bigger than 8.5"" x 11"".  If you have a lot of double-sided documents to scan and/or odd-sized paper, don't bother with this one.Software:  it nags you repeatedly to register it, even when you click cancel every time.  This is a network printer, and many of us will likely be installing the drivers and software on multiple PCs.  We don't want to be nagged on every single one of them.  Let me register the printer ONCE and then get out of my face, Lexmark.  Stop nagging me.  Or at least give me the option to turn off the nag screens permanently after the first time and then respect that choice.I don't know if it's true, but I've also read online in more than one source that the Lexmark software constanly ""phones home"" to the motherhship with your printer usage data.  If we want to participate in your passive-aggressive market research, we'll tell you.  Don't be stealthy about it, jerks.I realize this is a very inexpensive printer with probably too many features packed into such a small sized unit.  We get what we pay for when it comes to hardware. Shame on me for going the cheap route.  It really does none of its ""all in one"" functions very well.  I tried to use print, copy, and scan many times and it was always a nuisance.  The FAX transmission may or may not work well--never tried it--but with scanning so difficult at least half of the FAXing process would always be a tiresome chore.There are at least two other printer manufacturers that are far superior to Lexmark.  You probably already know their names.  I strongly suggest you don't be fooled by the 'cheapest ink in the biz' advertising and pass Lexmark over for one of the better printers.  It's not cheap if you have to waste your time constantly battling a device which should be a reliable silent partner that you don't even have to think about it other than to load paper and ink occasionally.In other words:  just print or scan my freakin' document and let me get on with my life already.  Stop nagging me, stop making so much noise, and stop being so high maintenance.  We want to use our printers and move on to the next task, not babysit them day in and day out.",0,0,0,0
R3LFCMX7HAK4IO,"Whitney Houston's Greatest Hits came out in 2000 (originally supposed to have been released in the late '90s). I bought it hoping it would have the songs of hers that I love. Some of these songs of hers are the originals that are found on Disc 1 and her previous albums, such as: You Give Good Love, Saving All My Love For You, Where Do Broken Hearts Go, and I Will Always Love You. I was really disappointed to find that some of her other songs that I love have been wrongfully remixed to where they are almost unrecognizable. These ones are: I'm Your Baby Tonight, How Will I Know, I Wanna Dance With Somebody, My Love is Your Love, and I think a couple of others (??). In my opinion, it was a crucial mistake for the manufacturers to give these latter songs the remix job. I thought those were the originals, but boy was I wrong!!! The original versions of those latter songs from Disc 2 should have been put on there as is, but not with a totally different sound to them. I was horribly disappointed about that. I have never listened to it since then, as I have made my own GH collection of Whitney's. I don't know what people have been thinking, but I don't think that this is a great album of hers (nothing personal to Whitney, don't get me wrong). This Greatest Hits title would have been an even better one if the originals of the songs from Disc 2 that I mentioned had not have been butchered up. If you want the originals of those several songs, buy the individual albums that they were on before; forget about this title!! The only thing I give credit to regarding this album is the front cover image of Whitney with a drill. WOW!!  My final note to all Whitney fans: If you have a CD burner, some blank CDs, and have these albums of hers on CD: Whitney Houston (1985), Whitney (1987), I'm Your Baby Tonight (1990), The Bodyguard Sdtrk. (1992), Waiting To Exhale Sdtrk. (1995), The Preacher's Wife Sdtrk. (1996), and My Love Is Your Love (1998), you can make your own greatest hits or boxset choosing whatever song titles of hers you like from those albums (if you want to), and put this butchered collection to shame.

R1VBVFSYJM5DTL,"Following the outcome of the latest Academy Awards with Crash surprising everyone by getting the Oscar for Best Picture, I thought I should perhaps see this film. I watched it with the best intentions and an open mind. I really thought I would like it because I knew it dealt with an interesting subject matter.Unfortunately, the truth is that, while watching Crash, I really had the impression that I was simply watching a TV program, some kind of ""bad cop/good cop"" TV show. Nonetheless, I still found Crash to be an OK movie, a ""movie with good intentions"", but overall, just an ordinary made-for-TV movie. I thought it was too simplistic and, in some ways, childish in its treatment & development to be worthy of any significant praise. The first line uttered by Don Cheadle at the beginning of the film is so unnatural, unrealistic, and moralizing that my reaction was: ""What?! Do they think we're stupid?"" The problem with this film is that it is ""pushing"" a moral. It aims to carry a ""message"" and does so without finesse or subtlety. It is done so that the ""not-so-bright"" gets the message, i.e. ""we're all racists, let's all love and accept one another, ... and, if necessary, let's crash into one another in order to touch one another""(!). I personally do not particularly like ""preachy"" movies and, Crash IS preachy. This film could really have been entitled ""Racism 101"", ""Racism for Dummies"", or even better ""Racist Stereotypes - Advanced Level"". Mind you, I do not live in LA nor in the US, and I realize that such a film is perhaps necessary.I really thought that the storyline was ""un-believable"". This sequence of coincidences is so contrived and artificial that, after just a few minutes, you can clearly see the pattern established, you can predict the ""surprises"" and, as the film goes on, you then automatically expect the ""unexpected"". It seems like the makers of this film are simply trying too hard. It considerably reduces the credibility of the film.It is un-believable that this film won the Oscar for Best Picture. How did that happen?! In any case, the Oscars have hit a new low.It is un-believable, and sad, that the Academy actually fell for the persistent and aggressive Oscar campaign orchestrated by the producers of Crash. Actually, the simple thought that these awards are earned through of a pushy ""Oscar campaign"" makes me wince... So much for the credibility of poor old Oscar.Let's face it, Crash did create quite a ""coup"" on Oscar night for a movie that had quickly sunk into oblivion last summer. After all, it only ranked 58th in the 2005 year-end compilation of film reviews in the March issue of Premiere Magazine and was not even nominated for Best Picture at the Golden Globes. Despite the fact that Crash addresses the touchy issue of racism in LA, many reviews in reputed publications, including the LA Times, were rather negative mentioning how manipulative and unrealistic it was, and how it ""exploited stereotypes"". After watching the movie, I personally felt as if I probably needed to be more wary of people of other races. I felt that it only ""reinforced"" and ""validated"" existing negative stereotypes. Now, was that the intention of the film? I doubt it, but facile stereotypes are used without any restraint throughout.In the end, I think that host Jon Stewart summed it up pretty well on Oscar night when, in order to save time, he said ""Whoever was NOT in Crash, please raise your hands"". He simply reminded us that Crash is ABOUT LA, was shot IN LA, and gave work to A LOT OF PEOPLE FROM LA, and of course, all these people FROM LA voted for themselves, probably also getting the votes of their colleagues and friends in the film industry (everybody would have done the same). But, was Crash really the Best Picture of 2005? I think that the answer is pretty clear and obvious: NO.After receiving over two dozens of Best Picture Awards around the world, the extraordinary and unforgettable Brokeback Mountain should of course have won the Academy Award for Best Picture which it truly deserved. An upset of this magnitude is without precedent in Oscar history and, it is simply unjustifiable and scandalous. Everybody seemed extremely surprised, even, of course, the Crash winners. Brokeback Mountain was from the start simply outnumbered in this specific ""LA-based"" organization which is, as it just proved, very self-centered and preoccupied in glorifying itself. It was clearly demonstrated, once again, that in the Academy, ""inside politics"" and other dubious factors have more importance over true artistic value. The Academy has completely discredited itself.I personally think that, as Crash's big Oscar rival, Brokeback Mountain might have been too subtle, too true, too profound, simply too good for the Hollywood peanut gallery. The impact of BBM has been absolutely ""historical"" in scope. Brokeback Mountain will remain a milestone in cinematic history. This film has been talked about all over the world and has attained unprecedented international acclaim - the ""Brokeback phenomenon"" has significantly crossed borders and has reached numerous foreign countries. Rarely have we seen a film have such an impact on society, in the media, and with the general public, even on those who haven't seen it or did not have the courage to see it. In no way can Crash measure up to any of this.Crash does have its merits but, by fetching the Best Picture Oscar through a desperate and very costly campaign, it showed that with money, you can make people believe anything. It also proved how irrelevant, unimportant and meaningless the Oscars and the Academy really are.",0,0,0,0

R2MPLJERCIXUNT,"I conducted a Great Pen Review a few months ago, in which I purchased a 12-pack of the following 0.5mm pens and distributed them to friends and family for evaluation: Pilot Precise V5 Stick Rolling Ball Pen, Micro Point, 0.5 mm, Black Barrel/Ink (35334), 12-Count  Pentel EnerGel Liquid Gel Pen, Fine Needle Tip, Blue Barrel, Black Ink, Box of 12 (BLN15-A)  Pilot G2 Retractable Gel Ink Roller Ball Pen, Extra Fine Point, Clear Barrel, Black Ink, 12-Count (31002)  uni-ball 207 Retractable Micro Point Gel Pens, 12 Black Ink Pens(61255)  Sharpie Pen Fine Point Pen, 12 Black Pens (1742663) The overall favorites were definitely the V5 and the EnerGel.  The EnerGel was generally preferred by those who liked a higher ink flowrate, while the V5 was preferred by those who liked a lower flowrate.  First impressions of the Uniball 207 were quite good, but occasionally these pens drew the ire of my reviewers when they stopped writing seemingly randomly with large volumes of ink still remaining.  The Sharpie pen, while better than expected, feels like a marker (because it is) and doesn't have wide appeal.The Pilot G2 was scratchy and terrible all-around; this appears to be a problem with the 0.5mm tip size, as I have heard great things about the G2 0.7mm. Sometimes the ink delivery would slow to a crawl, and other times it would stop completely; sometimes it would then return to normal later, other times it stayed broken.  Dropping or exposing the pen to the 'real world' in any way increases the probability that it is bound for an early grave.There are some truly fantastic pens out there - see especially the Precise V5 and the EnerGel - so there is no need to spend money on one with this many issues.  If you really love the G2 design, perhaps try out the 0.7mm instead - the tip isn't as fine as I require, but at least it doesn't have the ink delivery problems that this pen does.",0,0,0,0

R35L8MI5S59AKZ,"I give the diet a couple stars because it is definitely healthy.  However, after 2 weeks of following it strictly, I did not lose a single pound.  Losing weight was my ONLY reason for trying this as I was already eating healthy, tho not as restricted as this diet calls for.  And so after all the effort this plan requires, I did not wish to continue  If you read the 1-3 star reviews, you will see this diet did not work for a lot people, yet others had great success.  I can only guess it is good for those who have a significant amount to lose, tho any diet will work for these folks.There is a lot of exciting verbiage throughout the book, such as, ""jaw-dropping weight-loss"" and ""turn your body into a fat burning furnace"".  It's easy to get caught up in it, but I suggest you take it with a grain of salt.  And don't read only the good reviews….I have read people complain about how much work it is, and I have to agree.  First of all, there is A LOT of going back and forth between the charts to get all the criteria organized when you are in your planning the meals stage.  And yes there is a lot of work in the kitchen.  But, I made the soups and stews in the recipe section, so some of the work was up front.  After the initial effort, which required enormous amounts of preparation and cooking and cleaning, I was then stocked with a freezer full of ready made meals, thereby not needing to do as much cooking in the subsequent weeks.  Some of the recipes were good, some okay, and some - yech!Just as an aside note, she pontificates on the importance of the nutrient packed vegetables, but then a recipe calls for putting them in a crockpot and cooking the snot out of them for 6-8 hours….Anyway, it seemed I was constantly living my day around this diet; with all the work involved in preparing and eating every 3 hours, and constantly drinking water.  This became tiresome, especially when no weight was being lost!  Maybe I might have lost some weight after the full 28 days, but I wasn't willing to drag it out another 2 weeks.  Especially since many others did and had no success.  I am going to go back to the Atkins, as that really worked well for me before.

R45YCI2OWH3HD,"Well, my ""HUGE 18 oz Seedless Black Raspberry"" was sent in 2 smaller 9 ounce jars...unless my math is off, two jars are not one ""HUGE""jar. So we start off with LIE #1...not great. No ""Gee whiz,  we are sorry we ran out of 18 oz "" ...just 2 small jars with no explanations. LIE #2 is that this jam is not seedless...it has seeds though not a lot as it is a kind of watery jam, more like heavy syrup than jam. However it IS a fine tasting with lumps of what I hope is Black Raspberry ( I can not test to see if thats lie #3 or not). I also hope there's no corn syrup in it, it's just hard to trust them at this point.

R1I1FO7JS922XU,"When you look at the different reviews, it's really hard to know what your experience will be.  I saw that most said their bulb worked well.  Mine did not.  It was WAY dimmer (like 75% dimmer) than my previous bulb which already had 2500 hours on it.  Also, the colors were way off, like a red tint to everything.  Perhaps because it was so dim it didn't push light through properly, but I'm not sure.  In any case, the bulb is useless to me, and I'm asking for a refund on it.Another note, if you get a smell to a new projector bulb, that's really normal.  After several hours of use, it should be burned in properly.  As for the one I received in particular, I even wondered if perhaps I had received a used bulb somehow, but it did have that distinctive burning smell to it.

R2WQCV2AQT3X5W,"First-off, let me say that I purchased the ""Bastard"" complete collection based on the reviews from this site...but I gotta admit, I'll be very careful about doing this in the future!!The show was a SERIOUS DISAPPOINTMENT!! Not only was the dialoge very simple (it seemed as if it was written for grade-schoolers), but the plot was also the same. And instead of being written like a story, it was written as if though it was a play - with ""Dark Schneider"" doing his stupid evil laugh at anything, and screaming everything at the top of his lungs like a corny Saturday morning cartoon for children. And don't let me start on the dumb sound-effects and ""foreign language"" they used when they cast their spells. (Umma-mulah, kabali-kooka, lama, etc...).And while I'm on a roll, let me make a comment on the nudity. TOTALLY STUPID!! Unbeknownst to me, Dark Schneider strips-down totally naked before going into some of the fights. Why??!! And the female characters in the movie are all scantly clad, and appear as if they were drawn for ""hentai"" (Japanese porno anime). You see the emphasis on bouncing breasts, undershots of their panties, and a scene where a girl has a ""seeming"" orgasm while being carried. HOW STUPID!! It's as if though the writers KNEW that the story was dumb, and decided that by having the girls scantly clad, and introducing the sexual overtones, the viewers would stay affixed to the show and finish watching the movie. (Please, don't underestimate us)!Oh, oh, oh...and don't let me start on the stupid voices. They were like fingernails across a classroom chalkboard! (They were definately wrong for the characters as well as this movie).So to end, if you like GREAT anime, purchase the complete Rurouni Kenshin, Fushigi Yugi, Samurai Deeper Kyo, or G.T.O. (Great Teacher Onizuka) series. These have great stories, as well as being written in typical Japanese anime formats. (I lean toward the TRADITIONAL Japanese anime, and not so much on the weak Westernized versions catering to the Americam crowd).  Of course there is much more great anime out there, but these stick out on the top of my head.Save your money folks, there is alot better anime out there for the money!",0,0,0,0

R3GCR0NMCWCHDH,"Based on the other reviews, I had high hopes for this book. I was very disappointed.  It was a tedious read and DRY AS A BONE. The ""humor"" was more of the ""I guess you had to be there"" variety. The main characters were underdeveloped and one dimensional and I didn't care anything about them. There were several places in the book that I couldn't understand the reaction of the characters.  For example: when the male lead first encounters the female lead, he reacts totally unrealistically - angry because she was ""half naked"" (in a bra and shorts, on her own boat, in the middle of the swamp???) and I mean angry - not lustful, not confused by a stirring of feelings, not with humor - but with a bitter kind of anger. Another example, this big-bad Fed is afraid of what this smaller-than-small town sheriff thinks of him? The main characters don't grow to know each other, care about what each other thinks, no kinship then -voila - all of a sudden they are in love. And what about her? Try to figure her out, it wasn't worth the effort for me. The relationship doesn't get developed, it gets dropped in your lap and you are told what to think and then told to move on. The secondary love story of the deputy and the cafe owner, as shallow as it was, still had more depth than the love story between the main characters.  There are threads of ideas and thoughts that start but never go anywhere. The same points are rehashed over and over.... I could go on but it would bore you.  I can't recommend this book to anyone, so this one is definitely a give-away to the next charitable organization that calls.",0,0,0,0
R3G6MLUV4U4C57,"This machine is headed to scrap at less than three years service life. It turns out key parts have a 20,000 page rated life and it prints before 17,000 pages.

Replacement parts for all these exist but everything failing so close to each other it's clearly not worth the money or effort to replace them.

RRF0HLVMA6TYH,"To echo prior reviews, it is a gamble when you order these, as to how many cartridges will work for the long term.  The review should probably be 2.5 starts, since these are just okay, and we continue to order them despite problems.  I have purchased these several times through my prime account and through our office account, and have occasionally had the entire package of cartridges work, but more often one or two of the color cartridges fails / leaks / streaks or stops being recognized by the printer.  Occasionally the problem occurs right away after installation, but more often than not the problem crops up about one week into use.  LD is mostly pretty good about replacing a defective cartridge, but sometimes because we order the larger packs, we don't install the cartridges right away.  So, while the price is great (about a third of the OEM), the savings has to be balanced against the time lost to fiddling around with the cartridges and trying to clean them and get them to keep producing; the time lost dealing with replacing the cartridge(s); the time lost while the HP printer pauses and goes into cleaning mode (sometimes two or three times on a 100 page copying job); and the frustration of having the printer become useless when we have critical color print jobs.",0,0,0,0
R2T64JFXB87ASE,"Kudos to the reviewer below for sharing the timely news about Dune's delay on DVD. There are stories at both TheDigitalBits.com and DVDTimes.com for those who need to know more, but details are sketchy.News that ""unofficial sources"" have told The Digital Bits that the DVD will be delayed ""several months at least"" is especially unwelcome, as is the added note that no reason was given. The way it's worded, it sounds more as if the DVD has been cancelled altogether, rather than delayed indefinitely.The possible reasons are endless: a hassle over music rights; legal wrangles with some of the principle; technical problems involved in compressing all that information (the theatrical cut, a 177-minute extended version, extras, etc., all on a single two-sided disc); unanticipated problems in matching the quality of the video transfer on the extended edition to that of the theatrical version; David Lynch's on-going curse against the film - or all of the above.It doesn't really matter what the reason is.Point is, a long-awaited, much-requested DVD is now no longer on the horizon - this, after Universal went to the trouble of announcing an official release date, setting a list price, publishing the cover art and stringing Amazon.com (and Amazon's customers) along for the ride.Personally, I'm  livid at home video companies that make these grandiose announcements, only to renege on their commitments when it comes time to deliver.Thanks for nothing, Universal. You may re-announce the title, but forgive me if I don't hold my breath until the DVDs are actually at Amazon's warehouse and ready for shipping.Oh, by the way - I've just learned that Star Wars: Episode III, Revenge of the Sith is about to be released on DVD. It's coming out on April 1 - before it plays in the movie theatres.It's going to be in HD-DVD (ie. you can see it  in High-Definition, even if you don't have a High-Definition TV set; it's remarkable technology, you really should check it out). The disc will include 212 minutes of additional footage that won't be seen in the theatre; Michael Jackson's original screen test for the role played by Samuel L. Jackson in Episode I; a hand-signed copy of the script by George Lucas; a signed 8x10 colour glossy by Natalie Portman; a dinner invitation with John Williams; and a weekend, all-expenses paid trip to Tunisia to see Star Wars' desert locations - all for the incredibly low price of $8.99!

After getting the same error code again, we repeated the process, with the same result. We called a printer repair store, and they told us that 70% of their printer repairs are because of off-brand ink cartridges, and that generally, the repair costs as much as a new printer these days.

And Ephraim... he was almost murdered near the end of the book. I was sorta hoping he would have been. I wouldn't have cared. Would have made the book more interesting and less predictable. The exterminator Vasiliy Fet was more intriguing, but was given hokey, clunky dialogue. And the main character Setrakian-- well,... a caricature, an amalgam of other stolen characters (I kept picturing Ian McKellen as Gandolph) because the authors just couldn't come up with a character of their own. Never read any Chuck Hogan books and don't plan to now. Del Toro should stick to movie-making, where his genius lies.

R16MH77CSMC0AI,"Spin by Robert Charles Wilson is a modern day science fiction mystery of sorts. One night, the stars disappear. Twin brother and sister, Jason and Diane Lawton, and friend Tyler Dupree witness the phenomenon from outside the Lawton family household. While their initial claims go unheeded, over the next and subsequent nights the world comes to recognize that powerful forces have moved against them, but for completely unknown reasons.That is the thread Wilson weaves throughout most of Spin: we know what has happened (on a superficial level, anyway), we just have no idea why or who’s responsible. Tyler Dupree is our narrator; much of the mystery unravels from his perspective. Wilson does a fair amount of jumping around from one time to another, so while we start with Tyler, Diane, and Jason’s childhood, the reader is quickly launched forward to an unspecified time where, as adults, Tyler and Diane are in hiding and on the run. Other jumps are made, always with the intent of revealing information and moving the story forward.Wilson does a nice job here, revealing just enough through various plot devices to keep the reader interested. The overlying mystery is perplexing enough, but once some headway is made into what exactly has happened, Wilson keeps us hooked with the attempted solutions.Jason Lawton and his father, E.D. Lawton, are at the forefront of these solutions. The Lawton family was already well-to-do and influential, but when satellites are suddenly rendered inert by the “Spin membrane” (membrane because while the stars are blotted out, sunlight is allowed through during the day), as it is come to be known, the Lawton’s aerostat business takes off. Soon they’ve formed their own agency to work alongside NASA in their investigation of the Spin membrane. Eventually, with Jason at the head of this new agency, they’re running the show.They launch probes, study data, and do what scientists do best, eventually discovering many things about the membrane. I won’t go into any of that here, though, since much of Spin’s attraction is finding these things out as you read along.I found Jason to be the strongest of the characters in terms of having a sense of purpose. He’s really the one who pushes to discover what has happened and why, and I wondered at different times what this overachiever might have done with his life if not for the destiny laid down for him by the appearance of the Spin membrane.While Tyler tells the story, it is only because of his close association with Jason that he (and thus the reader) learns what's really going on. In many ways, Tyler is a flat character. He spends much of his life watching the actions of others, on the periphery without ever really getting involved. While this may make for a good narrator, I was often more intrigued by Jason and his sister, Diane.As for Diane, I thought she possessed a lot of potential that was left unexplored. She disappears for large chunks of the story as she becomes involved with one of the many doomsday cults that spring up following the disappearance of the stars. There's not much religion or fanaticism in the novel per se, though given that the Spin membrane winds up threatening the future of humanity it's understandable that such things creep into the story.Spin is one of those books that isn’t necessarily bad, but it isn’t necessarily good, either. Wilson followed up Spin with Axis, but I’m not inclined to continue on with the series at this point.",0,0,0,0

The main problem is so out there that the most naive person on earth wouldn't be caught into thinking, could this actually happen? Ok, it starts out with a team of explorers in the Arctic when a giant crack opens in the ice. Is the explorer dead? No! At the last minute, with what? 50 pounds of equipment on his back, he performs a Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon-style jump across 10 feet of empty air and saves himself. Then the scene goes to a labratory and it shows that the earth will be frozen in a few days in a totally. So, because of global warming, giant expensive-special-effects waves come into New York and people run into a library which, for whatver reason, is filled with food and blankets. Then, voila, everything's frozen! So, the terrible actor's character's father says he'll rescue him from the library. We all know how boring the library is! He succeeds thanks to the main character using a pay phone underwater! So, in conclusion, this is a really stupid movie. A reviewer said this is good because its realistic, unlike Independence Day. I'd have to say  this is as unrealistic as Independence Day. No person,e ven a little kid, would see this movie and think, could the world freeze with giant tornadoes and hurricanes any day? Also, this movie is boring. We all saw previews and craved it until it came out. But, lots of the movie is set in that stupid library. (What's with the wolves!

R19TGDDR23Y2GV,"I listened to the audio version of this book read by the author Brian Kilmeade. The book is well written, but I have to credit Kilmeade's co-author for that for that, as Kilmeade mispronounces some of the words in ""his"" book.  It is remarkable how Kilmeade manages to sustain throughout the book a tone of outrage and sneering contempt for the North Africans. As soon as I realized what  was in for, I considered returning the book, but I was curious to hear the FOXNews take on Jefferson's presidency.  I also wanted to read the book because I'm interested in the period, and I've never  come across a book about the war with the Tripolitan Pirates.As other reviewers have pointed out, the premise of the book could not be more wrong.  If one were ignorant of the history of the period, one could come away with the notion that Jefferson was a strong advocate of the U.S. Navy. In fact, he dismantled the Navy, a mistake he later acknowledged when the lack of a US Navy became a significant liability during the war of 1812.  The title of the book is also misleading, or at least the subtitle is. The book does not even attempt to indicate any way in which the conflict with the Tripolitan Pirates had any affect on the course of US history. Indeed,the authors acknowledge that the same pirates defeated during the Jeffersonian presidency had to be dealt with again during the war of 1812.The first chapters are especially hard to take, as Kilmeade luxuriates in his outrage over US sailors taken captive by Tripolitan pirates and held as slaves. He can barely utter words like Muslim or Islam without hissing, and he takes no note of the fact that US sailors were subject to equally harsh treatment when they were impressed by British naval ships. He imagines Jefferson's torments at the thought of US citizens subject to harrowing voyages across the Atlantic only to find captivity when they reach their destination without noting the irony the Jefferson was himself a slave owner whose ""property"" either had themselves experienced the same voyage in reverse or were the descendants of people who had.These faults aside, the book is lively, and the story is well told at least in part. I feel like I have some background now on the conflict with the Tripolitan Pirates. I need to get my hands on another book and learn the rest the story.",0,0,0,0
RR640HRXSOVR8,"Not bad.  Okay, so that isn't the finest way to start a review, but it's the best way to start this novel - not bad.  It's far from stunning, and far from a Dune book - far from being what is considered ""proper"" science fiction! - but it is good if accepted as a fairly simplistic  action-adventure sci-fi novel aimed at a predominantly teenage audience.  There are a not inconsiderable number of inconsistencies with Frank  Herbert's original Dune Chronicles, but these aside, D:HA is fun at a base  level.  If I were to enter into honest criticism, I would cite weak  characters and poor research as my main gripes.  However, apart from this,  D:HA is a fair (if oversized) read.",0,0,0,0
R52IKQ1J8F51U,"I was looking for a clear standard size clipboard, when I happened across this one.  I wasn't sure about the ""flat clip"" design, but I decided to give it a try.The pros:+ Low cost, $3.99 with free shipping, when I bought mine.+ Good product reviews.+ Clear, modern looking acrylic board.+ Imprinted ruler.  Inches on the right side & centimeters on the left side.The cons:- The plastic wrapper is difficult to remove, especially around & under the clip.- No place to clip a pen or pencil, like on a traditional clipboards.- The paper isn't clipped flat to the board, but is raised about an 1/8th of an inch at the flat clip.  This is due to the design of the ""flat clip""- The hanging tab hole is too small & the tab rattles when using the clipboard... very annoying!  I decided to cut it off! :(Closing thoughts:I thought this updated design would be an improvement, but I was wrong.  I've since ordered this clipboard:  Sparco Transparent Plastic Clipboard, 9 x 12-1/2 Inches, Clear (SPR01860)  It costs a bit more, but it has the traditional clip with a larger hanging hole. :)",0,0,0,0

R2O0GQ1SOJJ813,"As someone who enjoyed Clerks, Mallrats, and Chasing Amy (all by Kevin Smith), I had high hopes for Jay and Silent Bob.  Jay and Silent Bob, who played roles in each of these movies, were a highlight, which probably gave Smith the idea to feature them as stars of his next movie.  Bad idea.Jay and Silent Bob were like the pickle with your pastrami sandwich.  It's a really enjoyable part of the meal.  But what happens when you make an entire meal out of nothing but pickles?  There, in a cellophane wrapper, is what you have with J&SBSB.  I laughed maybe three times during the entire movie, mostly at Will Ferrell (who plays a clueless Forest Service agent).  Jay and Silent Bob were absolutely unfunny.  The romantic line (Jay falling for a beautiful jewel thief) is utterly unbelievable, and the diaglogue completely unfunny.  I enjoy good cussing as much as the next guy, but you will enjoy this movie only if random cussing and guys telling people other guys are gay, by themselves, are riotously funny.  In short, this movie primarily appeals to 12 or 13 year old males with less than average intelligence (or the equivalent).",0,0,0,0

R9Z7VVB0FOX0K,"Update: 1/2013I have now had this chair for around 13 months and I am downgrading my review to 1-star. I previously had problems with weak welds in the caster mounts causing chair to tip.  My chair has now developed a new wobble at the point where the base stem connects to the bottom of the chair. Again it looks like a weak weld gave out.  The wobble is very annoying.  This is simply poorly constructed made in china junk.  To reiterate I weigh 300 lbs and I am not doing gymnastics in the chair.  I have never had these problems with other office chairs which did not advertise being specifically designed for large and heavy people.In short, DON'T BUY THIS CHAIR!!Hope this helps someone else out.I gave this product 3 stars because the chair itself is very comfortable, but I encountered quality control issues with the base of the chair and the casters. The problem is that the welds which connect the caster receptacles to the actual base are weak and they break. The caster doesn't fall out but then the whole caster assembly can wobble inside the base. When weight is put on the chair the caster then slumps sideways. This leads to the chair tilting to whichever side the caster has slumped to. Also, any caster which is tilted tends not to roll correctly which means that a chair in this condition won't roll most of the time. This problem developed around 3-4 months after I purchased the product.(Just for the record I weigh around 295lbs. so I was not near the chair weight limit.)I solved this problem by replacing the entire base of the chair with a comparable base from the old chair I had been replacing. This was simpler than talking to customer service to get a replacement. Generally, in my opinion if I have to talk to customer service your product has already failed.Just for the record.. removing the base was extremely difficult and required serious work with a heavy hammer. (to be expected)Additionally, there is a design/quality issue with the base. The base is tubular steel and there are welds around the edges of each 'foot' where a caster assembly is attached.  These welds are very rough and when I was sitting in the chair with socks on everytime I moved my feet across the 'foot' the rough welding would tear at my socks. This is a minor usability issue, but I never had it happen with any other chair i've purchased.So make your choice.. but be warned.  I don't know whether they've fixed this issue or not.",0,0,0,0

I'm on Amazon right now to order an extra-long USB cord so it can reach from our printer to our computer. It's a great idea to be able to print directly from phones, iPads, etc., but I'll take the reliability of good-old-fashioned USB any day.Also, I'm convinced that there's some kind of Gremlin drinking my printer ink, because as infrequently as we use it, we always seem to be short on ink. Maybe Epson cartridges are rigged to dry our or run out faster - it wouldn't surprise me. And it's asinine to require that there be ink in the color cartridges when I'm only printing Black and White.

Although both shipments contained product boxes with previously used parts taped back up in a box that looked like it was thrown from a moving truck several times.

When putting this together there are 4 parts (corners with wheels).  The corners fit together where one side is larger than the other and fits into the other corner piece.  Both are then bolted together in (1) place.  This is not a sturdy design at all.  However, a drill and some extra bolts can solve this easily.My major problem with the second shipment is I was sent 3 of the same corner pieces which make this thing impossible to put together.  I say impossible, but I will make it work by drilling and adding bolts where I need to.This thing comes with some junk screw hardware so I will be drilling some extra holes for added support, and making this thing work for what I want.

When you first install these on your HP printer, depending on model, you will receive a cautionary message about using other than HP genuine ink.  we ignored this message of course.  After installation, the colored images printed with Starink were not very true to life.  In fact, they were considerably off and we noted some runs in the initial pages we printed.  The runs mostly cleared up after a few pages were printed, but the colors were still off.  The black works fine for printing text.  We didn't mind the colors being off considering the savings.  Here is where I have a real problem.  Starink claims their product is ""high capacity.""  However, the colored ink cartridges ran out rather quickly and we printed far fewer pages than with the HP cartridges.

RKP98MY1JK67S,"As I sit here comparing my 2015 and (new) 2016 Moleskine Weekly Notebooks, there are two quite disappointing and unnecessary changes introduced for 2016:First, the eminently useful, vertical annual planning calendars in the front of the notebook - which allowed one to plan for four months at a time over two years - have been replaced by very conventional single-page mini monthly calendars, which are actually a disadvantage for planning purposes, and seem to miss the entire point about annual planning. What's more, there were TWO years of the previous vertical planning calendars, which (apparently to save page counts and production costs?) have been replaced by only ONE year of these stupid blocky monthly calendars. So there's no longer any place to jot in your plans for the next year, which is this case would be 2017. It seems like a whimsical decision by Moleskine, and at least for me (I do plan events and deadlines months and even years in advance), this really detracts from the previous usefulness of this product. Very disappointing.Second, the very nice typography of previous years has been replaced with a rather heavyset type which draws attention to itself on every page. Again, it seems a rather whimsical and counterproductive design decision. Very much an anti-Moleskine decision. (It's kind of like putting sharp edges on an iPhone, and I don't even own an iPhone but can understand the aesthetic appeal).I can't put my finger on all of the things that are wrong about this ""new and improved"" 2016 Moleskine Weekly Notebook, but there are several beyond those already mentioned.I've been using various Moleskine since before they were popular (10+ years?) and they obviously have a new designer who has made some very poor decisions.

R3JPFZS09VPTUO,"DO NOT BUY THIS, IT IS NOT OEM! I have read many reviews on this product and many of them say it is great and worked fine. People may say that, but this product is not OEM. I do not understand why this product is listed being sold by OnePlus because it isn't. This screen is counterfeit, it is as simple as that. Though I am not sure about the actual panel, the glass is definitely not gorilla glass and I am not even sure if it is tempered. It is missing the oleo-phobic coating (what makes the screen feel smooth and not sticky) and the thickness of the glass is also off from the original product. The bottom buttons are clearly not the same transparency as the original and my model is even cut off at one point. There is a small spot toward the bottom corner of the display that has a red and blue tint when the pixels change from pure white. Many people might think products like this are OEM because it can be difficult to detect counterfeit products, especially this screen in particular. If you buy this screen, it might work for you, but you can be sure as hell you are not getting an original product. I am very disappointed that sellers like this can even continue on amazon but the counterfeit market is thriving here. If you really want to guarantee an OEM product I would recommend a site like etradesupply.com.  It might be a little more money but you know you are getting legitimate products. I regret buying this screen from this seller because now it isn't worth it for me to buy an OEM panel.  If you would like to know more about counterfeit products I would recommend YouTubing a few videos because it can be very helpful information especially when making a buying decision similar to this one.

R3UO3O5ZQSJWMV,The good: They get an extra star because they are so cheap. I only paid $35 for them. I was able to get the right size with the Amazon reviews. I usually wear a 10 1/2. I got a size 10 and the size is just right with 2 socks.The Bad: They are uncomfortable and stink horribly due to the rubber sole.I bought these for a single use because I needed black polished boots for a formal occasion and they were cheap. I thought I could wear them as work boots afterwards. I'm glad that I only needed them once because they are the most uncomfortable boot I've ever worn. The tread made my foot feel like they were bending my foot into a U shape. My 8 year old work boots that I thought were hard and uncomfortable felt like pillows afterwards. Buy something with at least some sort of a mid-sole so there is something between you and the boot tread.I'm pretty sure the soles are made of cancer. I've been letting these things air out for a couple weeks and they still stink up an entire room. I guess if you like smelling like a new tire then these are for you.,0,0,0,0

R14IGE03J7R06X,"I have been using the neat receipts software and scanner combo for approximately two years now, and I just can't recommend it. The software is clumsy, and makes you wonder how this can be considered a productivity tool.The while you can scan at a reasonable pace (I have no issue with the scanner), the scanned receipts pile up in the cue (my computer is reasonably well resourced and reasonably new).The character recognition software is weak enough that vendors are rarely identified, total amounts are frequently incorrect, and dates are frequently wrong.While reviewing and correcting your receipts, it does not appear that you can always navigate where you need to go using the keyboard. Plus, when using the mouse, repeated clicks are required in most fields to gain focus for editing. The software appears to try to maintain your sort order (ok, a good thing), but when you are editing the field on which you are sorted, the row will move to its properly sorted order, and you all of the sudden find yourself viewing and editing a different receipt (not so good). Then, off you go searching for your original row so you can finish editing.Additionally, the database is PAINFULLY SLOW, the dollar Amount field is left justified (making it hard to visually scan), and the use of real estate on the screen is inefficient and there is simply not enough control over it. Plus, the smart comment feature? It simply is not.This product has been out for quite a while, and it seems to be going nowhere.I hate doing expenses enough as it is, and this product isn't helping.",0,0,0,0

R33TLFS68VKF6R,"I'll keep this to a few main points that really bother me about this movie, since it appears I may be beating a dead horse with some of this.Cars 2 retains none of the charm of the original Cars.  Last I checked, the target audience for this series was kids.  If that is still the case, then the utterly ridiculous ""British Spy Movie"" theme that the Disney people decided to go with is probably completely lost on their target audience.  Unless children have completely oblivious and irresponsible parents, then there is no way that any kid seeing this movie should know anything about James Bond.Next, the over-the-top environmental messages that the audience is bombarded throughout the duration of this are nonsensical and have no place in what is supposedly a light-hearted kids movie.  I don't appreciate Disney trying to indoctrinate my kids with the idea that ""gasoline is EVIL!!"" and we should all be trying to use ""alternative fuels"" to power our cars.Lastly, what in the h*ll is with all the guns, explosions, and violence?  Disney, have you forgot that you are a (thinly disguised)left-wing organization?  Have you forgot that left-wing people HATE guns?  Especially when it comes to guns and kids?  Yet somehow, it's perfectly acceptable for a supposed KIDS MOVIE to be FILLED with guns and violence.  Don't get me wrong, I love guns.  I'm a lifetime member of the NRA.  But, there is a time and place for guns.  A ""G""-rated kids movie is neither the time nor the place.  Really Disney??  Mater with two gatling guns strapped to him blasting away at a room full of cars??  Unbelievable.I give it a 2 star rating only because, as usual with Pixar films, the animation is stellar.

R3LB57G85XUI6V,"When I first tried the stapler, I used about 50 magazine pages as a test. The stapler jammed. It continued to jam each time I tried it with anything, even when I was down to two pages. I called ACCO customer support, and after describing the issue they told me to return it or exchange it. I opted to return it. Although it's possible that mine was an exception, the part that the staples come out of was not properly aligned with the recess on the bottom plate, leaving nothing to get the staple to bend on the bottom.A positive point is that it comes with a lifetime guarantee against jamming when used with the correct (included) staples. I can't say how likely it is to jam, but if yours stops working after a while, you always have the option of calling customer service. They answered on the first ring, which is a plus.You might also consider the  PaperPro 60-Sheet High-Capacity Stapler (1200) , which has a capacity of fewer sheets (60) but works reliably and with very little force.

R13QY9GCF1KE27,"I do my best NOT to write reviews when I am upset.  But if I stayed with that otherwise simple rule, I'd never write a review of the HP Photosmart Wireless piece of crap.  I usually want to buy a printer that is easy to setup, easy to use, and easy to maintain.  The HPs generally promise each of those things.  The delivery leaves a lot to be desired.  If you are looking for trouble-free, look elsewhere.  First, I get printouts only sporadically. I have ZERO confidence that when I hit ""PRINT"" in whatever program I am in that I will actually get a print out from this HP.  It is wireless and three computers (and an iPad) and directed to it.  It prints MAYBE one out of five or six attempts.  It reports that it has a problem and 0% is printing, and it will try again in 30 seconds, which usually means it will print never.  Sometimes it works, most of the time it doesn't.I threw away the last HP desktop printer I had because it had ""printer head"" issues, and the one before it is forever turned off because my new HP desktop that it's connected to doesn't even recognize it, and HP Customer Complaint line -- it would be foolish to call it customer SERVICE or CARE because it is neither -- told me that the drivers for it are ""out of date"" and that they don't support them anymore.  Goodness!  You'd think there was some software that they could merely send me online that would ""care"" or ""service"" their past customers.But back to the Photosmart.  The look is fine, and the touch screen is cute.  But if you want it to print, this is not the product for you.  If you want to spend $50 every two months for 564 ink with moderate near-daily printing of a page or two, this is your printer! If you want mediocre printed photos that looks like someone smeared film over them or left them in the bright sun for days on end, you may have found your printer!This is an utter disappointment, and poor purchase.  As you see from the ratings, it is not a unique point of view.  Luckily, I didn't purchase a new $50 set of printer ink, because this one is leaving very soon.

R21SR5X1M8ZLDP,"I much prefer the other water brushes I've tried, which are Derwent and Pentel.  They work well and the mechanism is intuitive.  Simply squeeze the soft ergonomic barrel to release water to clean the brush or paint.  The more you squeeze the more water comes out.  it's child's play.  It takes seconds to figure out how much squeezing is necessary.  Filling is a doddle too as you simply unscrew the brush on top and pour water into the barrel, very convenient for filling when out and about plus they hold lots of water so filling is not required often.  With the caps on I've carried these things here and there in a pencil case in my bag for years and never once had an issue with leaking.This Caran D'Ache water pen is a totally different animal.  It looks much more stylish granted and the brand name is known for high end quality so you might be fooled into thinking the product would be better, but think again.The filling mechanism is more trouble than it's worth and the click click method of applying water is a hassle. It's a case of click click click this will take me forever with the amount I need, click oh no, too much and then  I'm trying desperately to get rid of a big blog before it drops on my painting, too late!You literally have to stop painting while you do this clicking process with thumb and index finger also, and the buttons aren't necessarily in the position you would normally be holding the brush either so you have to rearrange your hand each time or permanently paint in an uncomfortable position.Cleaning between colours is an issue also.  With the other brands you can squeeze water out with one or two squeezes that will flush the paint out of the brush, so you have a clean brush between washes.  The Caran D'Ache is not so simple.  With the click click click method of drips you don't get the flush that cleans, instead you get drips that leave you with a dirty brush to use for the next wash.All in all, I would love to give a good review for such an ordinarily high quality brand, but this product has no redeeming features.

The body is solid, but the filling mechanism doesn't work so well. At first it would fill only marginally. Now, after taking it out and reinstalling it in the pen, it fills near to the top, but the ink doesn't flow properly. The nib runs dry even with lots of ink the chamber. And, just today, it decided to flow at far to fast a rate very nearly causing an ink disaster. The nib is not bad, when the ink cooperates it creates a nice line.

R1ER2HUC5DQ5CN,"I have taken a number of fiction writing college courses and read numerous books on how to write saleable fiction, and the Fight Club breaks a number of golden rules I was taught.  First, your protagonist needs to be likeable.  This protagonist is anything but:  He's a disfigured thug, a creator of mayhem, and a restaurant worker who despoils food that is being served to patrons.  As a result, there is not one character in this book to care about.  Secondly, if you repeat something two or three times for comedic effect, that's fine.  Four times is a definite turn-off.  Many statements, most notably the rules of the fight club are repeated over and over again to the point of boredom.  Finally, the reader has to know what is going on.  If the protagonist doesn't even know - he's not sure if he's himself or someone else, whether he's awake or dreaming or maybe even dead - then how are we supposed to know?  I give the book two stars because it kept me reading, hoping that the author would eventually explain all.  No such luck.  At least the book was less than 200 pages.

However, like many of the other reviews state, this book drones on and on with stupid details of the journey. While it's interesting to get to be more immersed in the world that Brett has created, the novelty wears off and it just gets extremely tedious. Unlike other reviewers I found the more interesting parts of the book to be Inereva's story. It has certainly changed my opinion of her since I have gained insight into her thinking.The worst part of this book however was the saccharine love story between Renna Tanner and Arlen. Seriously, how many times does there need to be a declaration of love??! It doesn't help that Renna is very two dimensional character; one side devoted to Arlen simpering for his love, and another side with this nonsensical amount of anger and rage.

And I have read other books by this author that I did enjoy.Unfortunately, the heroine herself ruined this book for me. The author fell in the “strength = B*tch” trap. Just because a woman has a lot of attitude does not mean she’s strong or dominant. It just means she’s a jerk. She came off more like a sixth grader that thought way too highly of herself and constantly popped off with snotty one-liners that were not as genius as she clearly thought they were. I don’t think truly strong, dominant people feel the need to build up a protective wall of bratty sarcasm around themselves and fight absolutely everything just to prove she can. It gets old really fast. That’s a weak person hiding behind a facade.She also oozed “not like other girls” because obviously being a girl who is rude and sarcastic and likes to watch boxing and doesn’t act girly and isn’t aware of her own sex appeal is far superior to other women.As for the hero…he was pretty meh.

RMII5MZGG0U6E,"I bought this product back in October (on the 18th) despite having had previously disappointing experiences with HP. I thought perhaps their product quality had improved given some of the other reviews on the products. Was I truly disappointed. The first one I received worked for about month before it decided to start jamming up. It would jam up on ever print attempt and it appeared to be due to a physical misalignment of the print head, which was catching the paper. Of course, as is Murphy's law, this occurred on the one week of the month that I do the largest 'print work' from my home office, needing to print out dozens of reports for review.I contacted customer support and after explaining to them (in painful detail) what had a happened and what troubleshooting efforts we had taken to rectify the problem they proceeded to advise me to... go through all those troubleshooting steps again. I understanding 'due diligence' but I also understand that when a customer has expressed (in detail) that they have already went through all the standard troubleshooting steps you probably shouldn't make them go through it again; it's a very telling sign that they actually already know the steps.After about an hour of troubleshooting and back and forth, the customer service agent actually advised that they would send out a new printer but wanted to charge me shipping. Needless to say I had to put up an argument about that to get it waived because, well, the defect was theirs not mine. Then they proceeded to inform me that they had to take my credit card information so that they could charge me 200.00+ if I did not return the broken printer. I mean, I guess I understand that but who keeps a broken printer?Now I'm on my second one and it ran well for about a month (roughly). Now it's constantly loosing it's connection and requiring me to restart the printer to connect to my computer, for printing. I can't even get it to communicate with my computer for scanning despite the fact I've had no issues doing so on the last two samsung printers I've had. I'm at the point where I going to have to call in to customer support again (probably for another hour) to resolve the communication issue because their software can't resolve it.Honestly, find a better printer and skip this one.

In giving it the benefit of the doubt, I extended the legs and tilted the laptop base (which only has a one-sided hinge, made out of plastic, and really flimsy). I placed my 16.5"" laptop on the tray and it slid right off onto the bed (thank God). I tried it again making sure I had the laptop base behind the ""ledge"" so it would stay. Evidently, the ""ledge"" wasn't tall enough, because my computer slid off again. Pretty frustrated by now, I placed a microfiber towel underneath so it would keep the computer from sliding (that helped). When I set up my mouse, and being right handed, it worked out great because there is only one choice in mouse placement...on the right side...FAIL.

If that bolt loosens, then it will spin and there is no way to remove the post from the plate so you would have to rip out the screws to get the entire assembly off, and then of course you now have a major wall repair to make.  I would suggest getting some paint on bolt lock if you plan to use it.2 - Poor Quality.  The post does not screw on fully to cover the mounting plate.  The threads don't go deep enough and it bottoms out.  So the post will be a little away from the wall and you can see the mounting plate in the crack (see pictures).  They need to run the threads a little deeper or cut the screw off a little shorter.  I was planning to cut one thread off the screw but the next issue below made me decide to send it back.3 - Poor Quality.  The screw is crooked on the mounting plate (not square).  So if you could screw the post on all the way, it would be touching the wall on one edge, and there would be a gap on the other edge (see pictures).  The plate is pretty thick so I was unable to bend the plate to make it square.So, overall, they need to make another step in the manufacturing to make sure it is fit to be installed.  I bought 6 and only one was fit to install.  I over-tightened the screw into the post on several to try to run the threads deeper and got pretty close but it did flatten the threads on the end of the screw ... definitely not how it was designed.Another note - the pictures of the packaging are not accurate.  They are NOT made by Stanley which is what the pictures say.  They are made by National Hardware.  The packaging is identical other than there is no Stanley on the label, so that leads me to believe this product was bought from from Stanley by National Hardware, and the packaging changed, and perhaps QC was reduced or changed?  This is speculation but perhaps all the good reviews were on the Stanley version?Bottom line is I would keep looking for a better quality version of these.",0,0,0,0
R3EQLCDHPZWDZ3,"I was not impressed by Eragon. Firstly, I'm more of a Science Fiction guy than a Fantasy guy, so I'm the wrong audience, but my kid loved it and asked me to read it, so I did. It is not the best fantasy book ever written, it's not even the best fantasy book I've ever personally read. It suffers from being overlong, and having laconic pacing, and rather uneven character development. This last part is, I think the books biggest flaw.Brom, for instance, we're supposed to feel strongly about, but he's just kind of there, Obi Wan to Eragon's Luke. When he dies, Eragon is pretty broken up, but we feel nothing. Saphira is really kind of a jerk, but I don't think she's supposed to come off that way. The Murtaugh character feels fully fleshed out and engaging, almost like he's visiting from another book entirely. Eragon himself is a schlub for the first half of the book, but starts to improve in the second half, and emerges as a character in the last bit. That much was clearly planned, the rest? Nah.The rules on magic are well thought out and clever.I don't think people's complaints about it being Mary Sue are particularly valid, in that nearly all characters in books are surrogates for the author to some extent or another. It's almost impossible for them not to be. This one *is* more transparently so than most, admittedly.All that said, it's not a bad book, it's simply not great. It could have strongly benefited from some editing. It could easily have chopped out a hundred pages without hurting the narrative any.I seriously believe the book deserves some slack, though, because the author was 17. That's nothing short of amazing. I mean, I write. I'm well reviewed. I'm told by actual professional writers that my writing is professional quality, but that's at age 49. I started diddling around with writing at 17, and I promise you I couldn't have done anything this good back then. I couldn't even have managed to FINISH writing a book. So mad props to Paolini. I'll read the rest of the series, simply because I'm interested to see how his talents progressed as he aged.Word on the street is his next series will be Science Fiction. I'm interested to check that out.",0,0,0,0

R2AIA43HSHNOX9,"""Norbert Pressburg""'s book is - basically - an introduction to the first three volumes (of six) put out by the (German) ""Inârah"" institute. The theme is that the whole of Islamic history as we know it is wrong, and its subtext is that the modern-day muqâtilûn are dying and killing for an illusion. To paraphrase Bierce, authors like this wish to replace the existing Islamic illusion with others.Vincent Fisher has issued this English translation upon self-publishing platform CreateSpace. That implies Fisher did it all himself without an editor. More to the point, he hasn't *gone back* through the book, since he first posted it, to take into account the reviewers' suggestions, now including several right here. So, if you're wondering about that Temple ""of Herodias"" (p. 95) for ""Herodianischen"" (original p. 99) - it's still here. Also still here are all the points Abd al-Malik is called ""(al-)Malik"" (pp. 85f).'Tis true, not all the errors are Fisher's fault. Some of these mistakes derive from the original. Take p. 122 (123 original): ""According to Islamic tradition the Umayyads... descended from Umar"". That much holds only for Umar II. The Hadith says the Umayyads as a group descended from... Umayya. That is why we call them ""Omayaden / Umayiden"". If Fisher had any interest in this subject, and wasn't just a hired gun, he'd know this. I suggest here that Fisher should have challenged the original author on the original's mistakes.Elsewhere I get the impression Pressburg has read Ibn Warraq and/or the Christian apologetic sites, remembered some stuff, but then forgot where exactly he found it. So, p. 91 (95): here Muhammad is called Qutham in Ibn Saad's ""Annalen"" / ""Tabarakat"" (Fisher intends Tabaqât) - with no page reference. Indeed, no such reference exists. We do have record of a Qutham - but in *other* sources, like those cited by Henri Lammens, ""Qoran et tradition"" (English tr. in Ibn Warraq, ""Quest for the Historical Muhammad""). Then p. 23: the amusing story of he who read from sura 2 ""this is the Book in which there is no oil"". Pressburg doesn't remember; but this is the story of al-Zayyât, from the Tashîf, probably the Cairo 1908 edition as recounted by Margoliouth, ""Textual Variations"" (perhaps by way of Ibn Warraq, ""Origins of the Koran""). Then p. 200: this has the Arures (Haruris) being mentioned in Spanish synods - but no, J. Thomas mentioned only the 754 Chronicle; Arures do not figure in the 839 council (at least as Florez published its minutes in 1787 - I looked) and Pressburg hasn't pointed to anything else I can find. Pressburg's footnoting in general is simply unacceptable.As for what Pressburg distills from the Inârah circle: I noted Christoph Luxenberg, Volker Popp, Gerd Puin, and Johannes Thomas (wait for him in the third volume). Luxenberg's raisins of paradise make their appearance; and - from Popp - the whole Marwanid family has traveled in from Merw in Asia. This stuff isn't even worth refuting here, since our author makes no attempt to check any of it himself; he just accepts it.If you want a user-accessible introduction to the Inârah's output, this book is the best available. It also serves as a sneak-preview to Thomas's work. But it has little value on its own and, honestly, the value in Inârah itself is limited. This whole effort is like a bad hadith: a poor translation of an error-riddled introduction to very dubious scholarship.",0,0,0,0

REARK8U7UA9QF,"I agree with the top critical review of the film. I saw no character development in Alvie, and there was no definitive moment for me when I actually cared whether he and Annie stayed together. Granted, I'm watching this in 2018 after great romantic comedies like When Harry Met Sally have changed romance films- but I just don't get what's funny here. I basically hated Alvie through the entire film, and I found Annie flightly and dumb for a 70s woman who should have been a bit more empowered (or at least intelligent). Overall, she seems like she exists just for Alvie's sake until the end of the film when she shacks up with another dude. The ""quirkiness"" didn't do it for me either. I guess 30ish years later, talking to the camera during a scene isn't that quirky anymore, and doing a love story out of sequence just isn't that exciting. For me, this does not have the classic feel of an oscar-worthy film from the era like The Graduate or The Godfather, movies you can watch over and over again and still marvel at their accomplishment.",0,0,0,0
R1HA3KW9398TU6,"UPDATE- (merely 2 weeks after my initial review).  Dropping to one star.  The presenter stopped working after a week and a half of use.  I changed the battery, and it was not in any way abused.  It might have just been a dud, but it seems like the old saying rings true-  you get what you pay for.As a school teacher, I go through my fair share of presenters.  Because of the seemingly short life of presenters in general (some have stopped working, one was stolen, and one ended up taking a bath in a students spilled water) I bought this cheaper version, in hopes of not blowing 30 or more dollars every other year or so on a new one.  The long and short of it is that this presenter works- it’ll get the job done when you need it to.  It’s got decent range and the laser pointer is ok (not super focused, but again gets the job done).  My biggest issue with this presenter is that there is ZERO intuitiveness in this product:  to move your presentation forward, you have to hit the down arrow.  I’ve been using this 4 times a day, 3 days a week and I’m still messing up the flow of presentations by going backwards when we need to move forwards and vice versa.  Yes, this is user error, but moving forward should be the up arrow.  One other potential flaw is how flimsy it feels.  I constantly worry that it is going to break or outright snap in half while I use it.  But, you get what you pay for, and for 12 bucks I’ve got a presenter that works and I’m happy with it overall",0,0,0,0

R2OMT5021G0TOW,"In the backdrop of a dazzling glass world, where the people are shiny and clean and discardable cell phones are made from paper, ULTRAVIOLET is a dreamy spectacle starring Milla Jovovich in her tightest, most ridiculous outfit yet. She belongs to a group of disease-ridden exiles called the Hemophages, whose characteristic long canines have landed them the slur ""vampires."" With digital projectors, loud motorcycles, and the ability to manipulate gravity, scorned and vengeful Violet (Jovovich) is infiltrating the government's facilities to obtain a weapon that would be used to eliminate the Hemophages once and for all.Sound interesting? It's not. The plot makes a cheap 180 with the introduction of a child named Six (Cameron Bright), allowing battle-hardened Violet to touch into her matronly roots - a brave stab at injecting emotion into a movie that no one expected, or wanted, to be anything more than ninety minutes of explosions and an angry hot chick. Plot threads all race to the screen at the same time, forming a scrum - oh, we gotta get a weapon, now we gotta rescue a kid, uh-oh, I'm dying, he's dying, OH WAIT, there's a cure to the virus, nope never mind, now I gotta go rescue the kid. And death, apparently, is nothing sacred to writer/director Kurt Wimmer, who mows them down and brings them back like an X-Men comic. And why do Violet's hair and clothes constantly change colors? It was never satisfactorily explained.Don't expect too much more than gunplay and swords in ULTRAVIOLET - but expect to be wildly entertained with awful dialogue from the main antagonist (""It is on,"" he declares at the climactic final battle of the movie, brandishing his sword).",0,0,0,0

R3F8MNC1N4J4CJ,"White Oleander starts out as a page-turner: There were many nights when I first started reading it that I couldn't put it down.  About 1/3 of the way through the 446 pages, however, it starts getting bogged down in these very repetitive plot elements.  The following sequence is repeated for the rest of the book: Astrid goes from one foster home to another, has terrible foster parents who seem to be nice at first but then end up being mean and abusive or mentally ill, but she perseveres because of kind neighbors, cute kids, and/or ladies with nice perfume (Fitch mentions various perfumes ad naseum--practically every female character has a signature perfume)--and eventually she ends up leaving because she's either shot, kicked out, or her foster mother kills herself.  I'm only giving this book 2 stars because of the well-done sex scenes at the beginning.

R2JDIDI9JK0RHS,"I reviewed a few items for storing important documents (passport, org birth cert, legal documents). I settled on this because it has one of the higher fireproof standards as well as waterproof without being a safe or file cabinet. I felt both features were important. In that regard this fits the requirements .  I read the dimensions and weight, it is a hefty 45 pounds but I wouldn't want someone to be able to easily walk-off with this case; but you must be able to deal with the weight as the owner.STORAGE: as I indicated in the title, my main issue is with the bulk/size of the case.  The case height is 7-1/4"". Unfortunately, it doesn't fit under my bed (which was where I was going to store this). YOU CANNOT STAND THIS VERTICALLY or you negate the capability and/or effectiveness of the case - it must lay flat. At 19""W and 16""L  and 7.25""H - it takes up a lot of room. Be prepared for that.AIRED-OUT: It is adamantly recommended that monthly, the case is opened and aired-out, to prevent mold from occurring. For some that may not be an issue, but for others, wherever you store this, that may be problematic. I have purchased silica gel packets to put in the case and hopefully those will help. For those who want to store documents and forget it; that is not possible.KEYS: This case is locked with keys (not a code). You must maintain the keys and know their ID number if you lose them. If a fire occurred (tragic) and the box survived and you didn't have the keys, you could probably break into the case using other implements but you should probably have a key stored off-premises.In the end, I believe the case would protect the documents enclosed, which is the point, but ability to move this case, access for airing-out and storage are also important to consider.",0,0,0,0

Unfortunately I don’t know if this is a common occurrence but the first wrapped set of twenty protectors I opened from the box, more than 15 of them are not useable because two parts of the base of the protectors were essentially melted together and when you try to pull it to lock as their YouTube video instructs, the bottom flaps just rip where the two parts had melted together. Haven’t checked the rest of the box yet, but receiving 15+ Unusable protectors due to a defect is enough for me to rate it.

That being said, *The Girl in the Other Room* just doesn't stack up to her other work. The musicans on the album are still great (as before), but so much is missing from this album. Diana Krall is just confusing her *brand* with this one. It sounds more like Costello, and less like Krall. Not to say that Costello is bad, but I purposely bought a Diana Krall CD, and I don't feel that I got what I paid for. Besides a couple nice tracks (like *Temptation* & *Love Me Like A Man*), it's really not jazz at all, and the lyrics are abstract not thought-provoking.

R1UYD8OFSQV534,"'Wanted' is a current blockbuster with a great cast (Freeman, Jolie, MacAvoy, Kretschmann ...) It is a story about an assassin fraternity, founded ages ago by weavers, of all people.The best that I can find to say about this waste of time is that Angelina Jolie is in it and that she has learned shooting in circles. Another boomerang is invented by Morgan Freeman, who seems to need money badly and can't refuse any part, apparently; he selects a prospective assassin and trains him for coming back at him in the end. I guess it doesn't matter much giving away endings here, as plot suspense is hardly what this materiel destruction is after.The 'hero' is unlikely MacAvoy, who is a decent actor but not quite believable as action superman.Well, should I give a second star just for Jolie and maybe a little bit for all my Chinese Zodiac siblings who light up the house?

In the end, I could understand what I was reading (an undergraduate in exercise physiology helped), but found it far too boring and technical.I'm sure the science will help one understand behavior in a far more profound manner than without it, but I got tired of reading so much about the micro level anatomy and physiology of behavior, and not enough about behavior at the macro level.Additionally, I found the writing to be too flippant.

R39SFL7Q77IJB0,"This is a shifter story completely bogged down in repetition and disconnects.  The psycho male alpha has an unhappy pup-hood and ends up starting his own pack.  The latent female alpha has an unhappy pup-hood and ends up running away from an arranged marriage.  Story starts out pretty standard when alpha meets alpha and no matter what the situation they are immediately drawn to one another because they are ""life mates"".  Trey is extremely possessive of Taryn--he growls if another male even looks at her--but, he's willing to intimately share her with his pack elite if they will adhere to two body penetration limitations.  Really??  Just sayin'... Trey and Taryn are depicted as sex-driven individuals with a ""to-do"" list.There are scenes that have no relevance and what I'd call ""filler"" or an ""attempt to make connections"" in the book.  I got it first time that Trey built a wall around his feelings.  I got it first time that Taryn vows to never be used again--vows are meant to be broken.

R17V9KS6J0RSB1,"This performance planner and the company behind it have some strengths as in journalling goals, strategies, progress, beliefs etc is always a good idea ... so what's the downside?a) The Planner itself only lasts 2 months, so if use daily, as you should in a year, 6 copies would be needed costing a small fortune for what is basically the same sheet repeated 365 times.b) It is totally based around High Performance thinking, so unless you have read, liked and want to use that method the content is of dubious value.c) The format of the journal is HUGE like an ancient desk diary (I'm ancient, I know!) so useless for those who move around. Very impractical.d) I foolishly bought the planner thinking it would be good for anyone setting goals, but as I say it isn't unless you like High Performance book/thinkinge) I've read the first chapter of this book after ordering the planner (my mistake) and realised from that and then signing up for more info or checking out the blog than the author and his team are so hardcore sales directed (yes, they are High Performance) they are exhausting to read or listen or correspond with unless you already believe in this aggressive ""How Great I Am"" approach of the author and his team.f) I believe I either bought or got a free copy of an earlier Brendon Burchard book and had forgotten I had ... probably as I repressed it as being against my values (I'm more human based and less sell, sell, sell orientated) so i found it rather distastefulg) I am reading James Clear ""Atomic Habits"" which I like a lot and recommend but for some reason, someone with his agreement has made a planner too, but it is quite expensive for what in both his and High Performance should really be included s a worksheet in their books that can be downloaded and printed out as a PDF and then photocopied or simply copy the page from the book, or write down in a $2 notebook the key elements.h) It feels like having eaten the meat, the planners offer you the same bones, over and over again at several times the price of the meat. I'm lazy, yes! So I like some of the work to have been done instead of having to create my own journal but am dubious, at least in this case, that its worth it.I gave this Planner 2 stars instead of 1 for two reasons, its production is of very high quality (well done!) and clearly a lot of people like High Performance and don't find it as annoying as me (suspect it could partly be a cultural thing, not being from the USA).",0,0,0,0

It is without question the worst packaging I have ever encountered. Ever! Very strong and steady hands are required...lack thereof and you would not be able to open it.  Removal also requires careful use of a razor knife.  Without that, it would be impossible for a normal human being to remove the product from the industrial strength, impossible to tear, stretchy, obnoxious shrink wrap.

(And, I usually can find SOMETHING positive to note about a product).Cons:Installation was a nightmare. I originally ordered this for the desk in my office. However, once I received the astonishingly weighty tray (over sixteen pounds), I realized that I would have to drill sizable holes in one fairly expensive desk. Rather than nervously bore holes through a valuable piece of cherry, I decided to first experiment with it on a less pricey piece. And, thank goodness for that! Not only was installation a struggle (I needed an extra person to help me), but the end results was far from ergonomic. At first, I just assumed that I would have to ""get used to"" it (maybe years of ingrained, bad habits would have to be broken). Turns out, this was just painful and bizarre. No matter how I altered the product, it was just awkward. And, ""awkward"" soon translated to aches. Perhaps 3M needs to reexamine their design ... perhaps it's just a problem with me.If you were considering this on a whim, I vote that you skip it.

I will break this review into three sections; 1st e-printing, 2nd customer support, and 3rd regular printer functions (printer, scanner, & copier).1.  E-Printing: 1 out of 5 starsNEGATIVE - HP software only allows you to send your photo to ONE printer.  If you send the photo to two or more printers at once, no one gets the photo.  So if you are interested in sending photos to several relatives or friends on a regular basis then currently HP printers are not the product for you.NEGATIVE - HP server limits emails to 5 MB size.  So double check your file size of your photos.  We have two point and shoot cameras, one is 5 megapixels & other is 10 megapixels. Using these cameras we can only send 1-2 photos per email.  We also have a digital DSL camera, but most of our RAW files are over 5 MB and need to have the file size reduced to work with HP limits.2.

RDZG2T4M5GIFV,"I lasted 20 minutes before leaving this flick on prime video.  I don't know whether to blame a poor script or poor directing but this is one of the worst motion pictures I have viewed.  Reading the description is more than enough for me, watching it is a waste of time and energy.  My estimation is that if a 1hr49min movie does not bring the view in with plot in the first 15 minutes then there is definitely something wrong.  In the first 20 minutes there was poor attempts at humor and metaphors, a feeble attempt at 'sex, drugs and r&r' which didn't land on the mark, and action with special effects which is the only reason this flick gets 1 star.  This movie does not meet the criteria in any genre that I know unless there is a special genre for flicks with no redeeming qualities targeted to those with the lowest of expectations.",0,0,0,0

Listening closely, one can hear some interesting guitar feedback textures around the 2:30 mark, but not nearly interesting enough to redeem such garbage.'Little by Little' recalls 'Bodysnatchers' from the previous album, but without any focus or energy.'Feral' is next, except I find it nigh impossible to tell the difference between this track and 'Bloom'. It continues with the same incredibly irritating drum machine and completely incoherent vocalising that is found throughout the album.'Lotus Flower' - there are almost hints of melody and tune in this one. Unfortunately, the melody (and the bass line) are unremarkable. And don't get me started on the lyrics.'Codex' is somewhat better, although nowhere remotely as good as a track like 'Sail to the Moon' (Hail to the Thief), the closest comparison I could probably make. It is incredibly repetitive to boot.'Give up the Ghost' is notable for having an acoustic guitar, although the whole thing sounds like a loop, and it goes nowhere.As for 'Separator', well, I can't really be bothered anymore. See my comments on 'Bloom' and 'Feral' above. You may as well just listen to 'The Tourist' from OK computer, it is pretty much like they took that track and put it over that god-awful drum loop that they used for almost the entirety of 'King of Limbs' (after removing any hint of melody).This entire 'album' (if an 8 song demo-quality release can be called that) is a slap in the face to anyone who has ever called themself a Radiohead fan. They could give it away for free and it would still be poor value (unfortunately I eagerly bought the cheaply packaged 'newspaper' version for an exhorbitant amount of money). I can't believe that so many people have given this five stars - although I suspect these are the same people who would give five stars to an album full of Thom Yorke farting into a megaphone.And a note to those who praise Radiohead for their 'textures' and 'sonic landscapes' (blah blah blah) - drenching every track on the album with reverb does not a 'beautifully atmospheric' album make. Besides, Radiohead are relatively unskilled when it comes to dealing with creating atmospheres (that is, there are people who do it much more successfully) - they only succeeded by placing such effects within the context of well-crafted songs, of which there are none on this album. Some might say the same about Kid A, but at least that album was varied, interesting and had some real energy to it. This is simply the sound of a band that can't be bothered trying anymore.",0,0,1,1

Thank god it wasn't an expensive table I would be throwing a royal fit. Those scratches happened in like 3 minutes of time moving it around to adjust lighting and comfort etc.  If keep this, I will need to find a permanent fix for both problems. Covering the screws and getting to lock in my laptop. The only reason it got a 2 and not a 1 star, is bc it is doing what it should, but with defects.

R19335VWLQX97J,"I feel the Scarpetta series has slipped a couple notches with the last 2 or 3 books.  Before starting this book, I read all the bad reviews so I tried to keep an open mind and low expectations.  Even with that, this book left a lot to be desired.  This one finds Scarpetta trying to pick up the pieces of her life after leaving her job in Virginia.  It once again features Jay Talley, aka Jean-Paul Chandonne, and his wolf-like brother, Jean-Baptiste, who now sits on death row in Texas.  I didn't think the book started out too badly until I reached the point where Cornwell resorted to a plot device commonly used in soap operas--someone was brought back from the dead.  At that point, I almost threw the book down in disgust.  I kept on, however, despite that, the weak plot and the almost pointless presence of Lucy and Marino.  Marino in particular had little to do in this book except pout about not being the love of Scarpetta's life.  The ending was completely anti-climatic and worse, left the door open for another book featuring Jean-Baptiste as the bad guy killer.  Overall, it feels like this series has turned into a bad soap opera.  Scarpetta's personal life features too prominently in the story.  Cornwell should get back to letting Scarpetta solve crimes and leave her personal life more in the background.",0,0,0,0

R1QBLG44916H4B,"This paper cutter has no finger guard on the pressure (paper holder) bar.  It is very easy to cut your finger because the pressure guard is also loose and comes off, paper slips, uneven cuts.  I also think it is not really strong enough to cut a folded card (two layers of card stock at once), so the card slips and the cut is wrong.  I have used guillotine cutters for years and never once have I had a problem with cutting my fingers.  I am a very productive crafter so I use the cutters almost every day.  I have a large tonic guillotine and a full size office guillotine.  I wanted a smaller one for my desktop, thinking it would be handier.  In that respect it is.  But after I cut the side of my finger a second time (two separate occasions) when trying to hold a card in place for an even cut, I am trashing it.  It is just past the 30 day return, and I won't pass it on because it just isn't worth knowing the injury it can cause to any user.  I don't often strongly advise people not to buy a product just because I don't like it.  But I do offer that advice for this trimmer.  I like Fiskars products and find their scissors one of the best in quality, longevity and comfort of use, which is why I didn't hesitate to buy this trimmer, I trusted the brand.  Truth told, I never noticed the lack of a finger guard when I got it, my other guillotines have that, but it wasn't something I looked for when I bought them.  I have ordered the tonic small cutter, after I looked to be sure it has the guard.  Also, I have never had paper slip and wasted so much paper, time and effort with the other cutters, so on both cutting and safety this is a ZERO star product.",0,0,0,0
R2YCBQ1Y5LMX20,"If I read another review comparing this movie to a fine Pinot Noir, or a modest vintage, or some other lame wine reference, I'm going to throw up.  ""Sideways"" was clearly this year's winner for ""mediocre film that was fashionable to like.""  When I read the glowing reviews for this snoozefest, I keep wondering - what the hell movie were these people watching?!?Let's take a close look at the movie ""Sideways.""  Let's start with an unbelievably dull story featuring two pathetic, unlikeable characters - our male protagonists - that we don't really know a whole lot about - or care.Take randomn, unbelievable situations, two likeable, female characters who have NO chemistry with our protaganists, and be sure to add generous amounts of lame wine metaphors for life.  Mix thoroughly and there you have the movie, ""Sideways.""  Trust me, the yucks are far and few in between.No knock on the actors, they do a decent job, but there's nothing there, script or story-wise, that makes this movie work or enjoyable.  Don't kid yourself.The other thing that gets me is the pretentious, high brow appreciation people seem to associate with the film - maybe because the movie has something to do with wine - I guess they assume that lends a level of ""sophistication"" to the film.  In reality, nothing but the opposite could be true.  This movie reaches for the lowest common denominator and relies on crude humor: language, nudity, and sexual situations - in order to garner what few laughs the film has.When I hear people talk about the ""subtleties"" of the film and its humor, I just have to laugh.  Trust me, there's nothing ""subtle"" about ""getting your bone smooched,"" or watching a crazy naked guy chasing after Paul Giamatti with his shlong swinging around.  The creators of ""Porky's"" would be proud.  Sideways has made an@l intercourse humor ""highbrow.""Sideways is an amazingly average film.  Don't belive the hype.  To wit:  This movie sucks.",0,0,0,0

But get ready - its a real hassle to build it (unless you have a DRILL which we don't). It took us two hours, using a Philips head screwdriver and by the time I was finished, my hands and arms were really sore! The worst of it is, the bottoms of the drawers have no lock pins, nor does the manufacturer provide ""brads"" or even small nails to secure the drawer bottoms at the back, so they simply are free to slide out of the little ""grooves"" provided for them. See the pic attached. As a temporary fix, I put a piece of gaffers tape across the bottom to keep the drawer bottom from sliding out. Next step - going to Home Depot to get some small industrial staples or small nails so I can ""jerry-rig"" this thing, and take the gaffers tape off. All in all, this one issue is INFURIATING: it simply means this a STUPID/INEPT DESIGN, and extremely CARELESS ENGINEERING by the manufacturer.

R2C5ZZ4USDUBFL,"Somehow my previous review went whistling into the aethyr, but no matter.  This book is atrocious.  The premise is supposedly based on fact, and to give the author credit, she hasn't repeated Dan Brown's mistake by revealing her sources.  No, her evidence that Leonardo Da Vinci, John the Baptist, et al were misogynistic jerks is a secret so dangerous it cannot be revealed!  Clever bit of marketing, that.Silly marketing premise aside, the book is very, very badly written.  The plot is very linear, with few surprises.  The characters are of the sort one sees on fanfic sites, with the main character being an obvious stand in for the author- or at least how the author would like to be seen.  The rest of the characters are basically foils for the alter-ego, except for the Magdalen character, who is sort of a back-up alter-ego.  Everyone else is rather wooden- they are opaque cutouts whose motivations and personalities are conspicuously absent.Much time is spent on florid descriptions of irrelevancies, or endless praise of the heroine's abundant talents, grace, and general superiority as a human being.  What action there is is slow and poorly paced, the scenes overwritten.  Third person observations hover over scenes with no clear point of view.The lecturing that clogs the story's progress is shallow, an obvious nod toward Brown's style but without the insight. Opportunities to explore interesting spiritual topics are ignored in favor of trite plot devices (Seven demons?  Just food poisioning!) The villains are implausible as well, followers of the irredeemable John the Baptist whose motivations are never really explored- they're reminiscent of video game baddies who are just bad for the sake of providing the heroine someone to run away from- and for providing the author a way to work through some personal grudges, as some seem to be coincidentally similar to popular figures whose theses the author disagrees with.Worse, altogether too much of the text is taken up with a badly written, New Age-scented 'scripture' that is heavily hinted as genuine but shares too much of the author's florid style to be so represented.  Like Brown's book, many plot elements are borrowed from popular nonfiction works, but unlike Brown, Mcgowan is inept at stitching them together.  She doesn't seem to have any great depth of understanding of many of the topics touched on, so the 'factual' interludes have an elementary quality to them, especially when she touches on esoteric spiritual topics that are clearly over her head.",0,0,0,0

The heavier the package, the more the variance. We've run into instances where the weight displayed was more than 4 lb off.

R1LFBSWG0Y20G8,"A reviewer started off by saying that politics and poetics are not Ms. Olds' shtick. Okay, so how about intellectual insight (as opposed to observing the mundane)? Better yet, how about intelligence rather than melodrama? And better than that, how about a poetic language rather than journalistic description with arbitrary line breaks? The Chilean poet Nicanor Parra, in his Anti-Poems, defied everything poetic, yet the language he created was not a flat language--and was not truly anti-poetic. It sustained a distinct sound of its own. It sounded like someone knowledgeable of poetics quite capable of not falling into any of poetry's easy, conventional traps. I don't get that impression here. I don't mean to say that Sharon Olds is in any sense conventional. Hardly. Instead, she is wholly anti-style, anti-structure, anti-depth, anti-story--and anti-sound. Her poems are not anti-poems so much as they are anti-everything a poet might engage in so as to entertain another poet or an audience of poets. More telling, giving her a Pulitzer is not likely to win over any new advocates to poetry. What in this collection would attract them?I was at a bargain bookstore earlier today where I picked up a copy of Albert Goldbarth's Everyday People. I read three of his poems and concluded that the collection was entertaining, wise, nimble--a cognizant poet had created a sound and a story of significant depth that ran the gamut of emotions and intelligent observations. Who in their right mind would want to engage (their mind) in such a collection? I was happy to plunk down six bucks for the remaindered copy.Like Olds' Stag's, Leap, I noticed that Goldbarth's book was copyrighted 2012. Hmm. I also noticed on amazon that Ms. Olds has received 33 reviews while Mr. Goldbarth's book has received zero. I guess that's how you get remaindered. Shall we talk politics? Obviously Ms. Olds is more popular than Mr. Goldbarth. That's important if the two are running for office. But as far as quality goes? No. We know the masses have no clue. Still, 33 reviews for a poetry collection is extremely high, yes? What gives? What's up? Tell me what I'm missing.There must be any number of recent creative writing graduates, albeit none or few with a 30-year relationship to rail against, who possess the skill to craft a type of poetry not strangled in limp reportage and personal angst. They know better. I would think a great number of them are privately embarrassed by the selection of Olds' poetry collection as Pulitzer Prize material.

On top of that, because of how difficult the slot is to unseal, my index finger is all cut up and index finger and thumb nails are destroyed now. (Word of advice, put bandaids on your fingers before assembling as a method of protection). The other negative part of this experience was when I realized some of the metal clips are missing or broken/unusable so make sure you order an excess of the number of tags you need in case your clips are missing or broken too. I wouldn’t recommend these as a name tag option. The only reason I didn’t give one-star was because they look nice!",0,0,0,0
R3H6OLYULMEYV1,"Update: After this cheap ink clogged up my Canon iP100 printer, I tried everything but there was only one fix that actually worked.  I removed the cartridges and print head, and soaked the print head in cups alternating with Windex (or ammonia) and Reverse Osmosis (or distilled) water.  I soaked it for a few hours until all the ink was out of the print head.  I removed the thin cleaning pads on the right side of the printer using a long-nose plier similar to a tweezer, and also soaked and cleaned those of the all the goo.  I cleaned that area of the printer using Windex and Q-tips.  I don't know if I harmed the printer by doing this, but at least now it works.  I thought maybe I'd have to throw away the printer, before this fix.  I will never buy these junk refills again, I'll stick with the genuine Canon cartridges.Original review:Update: after the LD cartridge printed with the wrong ink level, I can't get the nozzle unclogged on my IP100 printer no matter what I try with the utilities.  I think this LD cartridge messed up my print head.I bought a pack of these cartridges because of the good price, but now I'm going back to Canon genuine ink.  The Canon ink level indicator shows that I have about 25% of ink remaining in the color LD tank, but it's printing awful gaps.  The color ink has run out prematurely.  LD needs to take this product back to the labs before they can claim it's compatible.",0,0,0,0
R36NTPAT0Q34BF,"This book is a joke, I think the New York Times review says it best....The New York Times gives a scathing review of Paul Offit's new book saying, ""Dr. Offit’s book is more a fervent attack job than an earnest attempt to understand people with different, if misguided views. His book is thinly sourced and poorly researched, seeming at times as if he began with a conclusion and then went in search of evidence.""In our opinion, ""Bad Faith"" is nothing more than an attempt to take away vaccine exemptions, not a genuine exploration of religion.SOURCE: NYTIMES.COM",0,0,0,0

R1M358KH2D1331,"Okay, so this device clearly states, ""Coin Manager Pro,"" NOT ""Coin Counter."" I simply assumed that when one of the coin slots was full, that was an indication that it was correctly counted and ready to be placed in a coin sleeve. WRONG! The slots actually hold more coins than can be held in a coin sleeve, BUT upon further investigation, with a bright light and magnifying glass, there are graduations on the sides of each coin slot that show the monetary amount. However, when I placed $10 worth of quarters in the quarter slot, the stack of quarters was exactly one quarter past the hash mark on the slot, and yes I recounted to be sure. So while this item was not dishonest about what it is, it's still very hard to read and seemed a little inaccurate to boot. I would have given this item a one star if it had called itself a ""Coin Counter."" Bottom line is that I am returning this item due to the fact it's nearly impossible to easily see count marks on the sides of the slots, and the count marks seemed to be inaccurate as well.",0,0,0,0

RCSQMWH5J0DA1,"I love the world Brett has created, I hate what he's done with it.Every aspect of this series has so much potential and I think that's what pisses me off so much about this series. The first book was fantastic, incredible magic system, incredible world building, incredible characters. The beginning of this series was so damn good, and then things get bad, they go from bad to worse and the trend continues.He makes all of his characters do things that the reader doesn't want him to do. I was really disappointed at the end of the second book, by the end of the third book he had run all of his characters so far into the ground that I was having trouble remembering what I liked about any of them in the first place.The worst part is that Brett seems to be enamored with this shitty literary formula of starting all of his books, by telling the exact same story from three different points of view. The only point of view I cared about was in the first book, making me spend half of the second and third books reading the same plot, from the points of 2 characters that I don't even like just makes me feel like Brett doesn't even care about the story or his readers. He took the same shit structure of the second book and made it even worse in the third book by telling us the same story again from an even worse point of view.I won't be reading the fourth book in this series unless I see some seriously positive reviews from the REAL readers. Most of the 5 star reviews on this website feel computer generated.I can't tell you how disappointed I was in this book and the direction I see this series heading, I wish I could give it less than 1 star.",1,1,1,1

R2F58VJJAGOWLZ,"I REPEAT. Do not buy this vinyl!  I absolutely love my Silhouette Cameo and have had it for about a year now.  I've always purchased Silhouette's premium vinyl and was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to use.  Since my first venture with vinyl, I've used it on everything, walls, plates, mailboxes, family member's walls, everything, really!I needed some new white vinyl and decided to head to Amazon only to realize they now only offer ""matte"" or ""permanent"" vinyl.  After some research I found that Silhouette no longer offers Premium vinyl which could be used for pretty much anything (I have it on our walls and my mailbox).  For indoor use with this newer vinyl, I should purchase the ""matte"" type. Well I did and now I am NOT happy.  I did a larger typography mural in our laundry room.  The vinyl cut well and I was able to take off the negative part easily. As I was doing this I even said to my husband how I was nervous to purchase this vinyl due to all the negative reviews but so far I really liked it.Well, folks, I SPOKE TOO SOON. Putting this awful vinyl on our wall was a HUGE pain in the butt!  It literally took me almost a half an hour to get it to even come off the transfer and even longer to make sure all the parts of the letters stayed on the wall! Every time I walk by the piece, I find myself pushing the letters back on the wall.It's so frustrating that I spent all the this time designing the piece, put my money on a silhouette product that I would have assumed was great, due to the brand name, only to be frustrated and having to buy new vinyl and restart the whole process!The photos attached are of the letters not staying adhered to the wall.

RDYOXGL99KCM4,"I was really looking forward to this one.  I even pre-ordered it.  But I finally gave up, after struggling for about a hundred pages.The first struggle was to get into a world that just seems too unbelievable.  On one hand, the magical ""flow"" drives, making faster than light speed travel possible, seem improbable (something I might overlook in a futuristic fantasy story).  Worse, on the other hand, everything else about the described world is fantastic only in how banal it seems to be; it's as if essentially nothing has changed from the early 21st century.  For much better world building and plot development, I recommend Neal Stephenson.The second struggle was with the glacial pacing of the story.  Chapter after chapter, almost nothing of significance happens.  In these many scenes, the included dialog appears to exists simply to demonstrate how boring a foul mouthed tirade can be, for anyone overhearing it.  For better dialog, check out almost anything by Raymond Chandler.I thought about just pushing through and finishing the book.  To this end, I went back to Amazon and looked over a few of the reviews, hoping for something to encourage my determination to see it through.  Unfortunately, all I learned is that this book only represents part of the story, setting the stage for sequels, rather than wrapping up the story.  Given that I would be pushing through to nothing, really, I abandoned it.This is the first Scalzi novel for me.  I still don't know if it's worth giving him another try.

RRQYGWKJ3Z298,"One of the reviewers lists several ""did you know"" facts about Lincoln.  With the exception of one that is not fact, but opinion, and one other, yes, I did know those things about Lincoln.  He was not an Abolitionist, by any means.  A majority of Northerners weren't.  These facts are available in any good history of Lincoln and the Civil War.  There's nothing new here.  Revoking freedom of the press, habeas corpus, and some other civil rights is not something admirable about him, any more than it is admirable about Bush, Jr. and Obama in pursuit of winning the so-called war on terror.  Leaders can be flawed without being horrible; you have to look at the entirety of their accomplishments.  Again, these types of actions are worth thinking about and evaluating, but historians have been doing this about Lincoln for years.  Finally, many of the anti-Lincoln reviewers here say that states rights was the foundation of the US.  But right from the beginning there was conflict between Federalists and anti-Federalists (those for states' rights), a conflict that often threatened to tear the beginning nation asunder.  The conflict and balancing act between the two can better be argued as a foundation of the United States of America, than one or the other.  (The Federalists didn't even want or think necessary a bill of rights protecting individual and state rights.) Many of our Founding Fathers were Federalists, such as Washington, John Adams, Franklin, Madison, Hamilton.",0,0,0,0

RFR03164YJT6I,"Bill Bryson has long been one of my favorite authors. ""A Walk in the Woods"" and ""In a Sunburned Country"" were hilarious. ""Notes from a Small Island"" was fun and fond of the English. So I was surprised, angry and disappointed about how mean-spirited this book is. I hope his real life attitude is not reflected in this book (though I suppose it likely is). He is, at least in this book, more bigoted than my father, and my father was egalitarian in his bigotry. With Bill, no one is safe from demeaning, stereotyping, uncharitable remarks. His disgust at fat women is described in so many humorous ways. Am I supposed to think that his comments that fat women are stupid, ugly, foolish and useless (I kid you not) are funny? I'm a little overweight (aren't many of us?), so you might guess I found this an irritation.But no one is safe. Mr. Bryson insults all tourists with the accepted stereotype, but x10. He disdains small towns with nothing to do, small towns with too much touristy stuff to do, big towns that have lost their soul to commercialism, any place the least bit frumpy (not ""trim""). He makes fun of every sort of person you can imagine (except himself). Even different races, ages, gender, you name it. Honestly, I don't know what came over him. I was shocked.

RYJKPGP8VM6J2,"... there is a limit. I am reading the prologue — the prologue, mind you — of The Given Day, and already I have read the f-word three times. Uh-oh, is this one of those authors?Curious, and because I could, I used my e-reader's search function to find the f-word and count the instances. 53 pages, each with 5 instances. Folks, that's 265 times that Lehane uses the word to titillate us or to demonstrate the grittiness of his writing.(He is less fond of the s-word, however; only 120 instances of that.)Look, I use these words occasionally. OCCASIONALLY. When I do use them, I am under some sort of duress. Otherwise, I try to demonstrate the quality that I look for in others: Class. Using these words so loosely and frequently is the antithesis of that quality.Therefore, using these curse words on every other page of his book demeans Lehane as an author in my eyes. Sure, once in a while, when a character is under duress, it would be natural; it would be realistic. But over and over again, in narration as well as dialogue, is just a cheap play on the grosser tendencies of society these days.I get enough cheap grossness in real life.

RUXQPB6RCP5IO,"I wanted to replace my over 20 year old telephone table from back in the days when all phones were wired. I really like the look of this table, but reading the reviews I knew this was going to be a hit or miss purchase. Even some reviewers that gave positive reviews had some issues. I figured I'll take a chance and give it a shot. Well it was a miss for me. There were some minor issues with the finish but they were not that noticeable if you were not looking for them. Some people say the table is flimsy. I disagree. The wood is pretty heavy and it's sturdy. The instructions are basically just diagrams, but not too difficult to figure out. The main problem is with the workmanship. Some of the parts do not align properly. Some parts are probably not cut to the correct size. I'm the guy people come to to put stuff together so I know how to do this. Rarely do I run into something where the fit and finish is so bad. My biggest problem was that the front legs where the bottom shelf connected were too far apart. There was a gap where you could see the wood dowels between the legs and the shelf. Because of that, the drawer would not fit properly. The rails on the side panels were too far apart for the grooves on the drawer. So the drawer would just fall to the floor. I read reviews with the opposite problem of the drawer being too tight. There is no contact number for the company that sell this in the paperwork, only a fax number to order missing parts. I did find the number via Google. They were friendly but had no solutions. If for the fact that I don't want to take this thing apart and try to stuff it all back in that box, it would be going back to Amazon. And I really do like the look. So I jerry rigged it so the drawer would stay in by connecting two 24"" zip ties together and pulling the side panels closer together. It doesn't look pretty and I'm disappointed I had to do it but it worked. Maybe I'll think of a better solution later on. Anyway the pictures will show how I resolved the problem.

R3PS9DMOBKLU08,"With some movies, I can tell within the first minute or two that I am going to hate them. Crash is one of those movies, it commits two of the cardinal sins of filmmaking right off the bat. Sin number one: lousy new age music that tries to be spiritual and meaningful, as if to inform the viewer, THIS IS AN IMPORTANT FILM. Sin number two: the movie starts with a laughably bad voiceover, an inane attempt at profound philosophy, always a sign that a movie takes itself far too seriously(trust me on this, folks, I used to write bad screenplays in my spare time, I'm as guilty as anyone of this amateur's mistake, but I was never nominated for an Oscar). In this case, it's Don Cheadle speculating that people in Los Angeles intentionally get in car wrecks in order to experience contact with others. That's right, it's not bad driving, it's some existential search for connection. Apparently people in New York never have automobile accidents because, as a pedestrian culture, they brush up against other people on a daily basis. Dumb, dumb, dumb. Unfortunately, the first couple of minutes is a harbinger of things to come. Crash is one of the worst films I've ever seen.In the early '90's, the great Robert Altman made Short Cuts, a brilliant, jarring and subversive look at present day angst, ennui, malaise, anomie, and any other fashionable term you can come up with to describe disaffection and emotional chaos. The film was set in Los Angeles and culminated in an earthquake, which was a great metaphor for entropy as well as a method for tying all the disparate characters together through a common experience. A few years later, P.T. Barnum, excuse me, P.T. Anderson ripped off Short Cuts with Magnolia. Magnolia was terribly over the top, but what it lacked in subtlety it at least partially made up for in chutzpah. For instance, instead of an earthquake, Anderson threw in a biblical shower of frogs. Magnolia wasn't a very good film, but at least it had enough style to compensate for its screaming characters and heavyhanded analysis of human nature. Now we have Crash, yet another film about lost and lonely Los Angeleans meandering about, their lives intersecting through a series of coincidences. Instead of an earthquake, or frogs, we get a snowstorm to wrap things up, the purity of snow signifying hope, get it? Well, the third time is not the charm. Crash is a hand me down of a hand me down, watered down Altman by way of Anderson by way of Paul Haggis, only Haggis ups the ante by making his film about race relations, which is part of the problem in reviewing this film.See, I think that one of the reasons this film is so highly acclaimed is that critics are afraid to puncture a movie that earnestly tackles an important issue. Make no mistake, racism IS an important issue, TOO important to be reduced to a bunch of one-dimensional characters, bad dialogue and contrived situations, all neatly wrapped up and delivered in a package so obvious it wears its self-importance on its sleeve. An issue as complex as racism needs a movie just as complex, because racism,and racial mistrust, are insidious things, they internalize themselves while spreading, hiding instead of expressing themselves openly in every single word of dialogue. But try telling that to Haggis. Racism is all his people talk about, and, in effect, his film comes off as one long, boring public service announcement.But you can tell that Haggis thinks Crash is a great, arty and important film. He certainly wants it to be. He went to the P.T. Anderson school of drama and dialogue, apparently, because Crash is loaded with scenes of people screaming at each other, using the F-word at least once in every sentence. Sheltered screenwriters(and movie critics) who spend their whole lives watching movies(most of which are bad) think that this makes a film gritty and realistic. It doesn't. It just makes the movie shrill and annoying. None of these people are real, therefore the situations are unreal, therefore the social commentary is diluted. Haggis shortchanges the subject of racism by attempting to explore it in such a trivial context.Still, the hype machine rolls on. Crash was even nominated for best picture(probably because the Academy is populated by a bunch of guilt-ridden Los Angeleans). If it wins, it might well be the worst film ever to get the award, even worse than Titanic, Gladiator and Shakespeare In Love.Crash isn't daring, it's the exact opposite, totally safe, and its lionization has set back the cause of serious-minded, socially-conscious filmmaking at least a couple of decades.",0,0,0,0

R2UEL2LGCAHIRA,"I gave it 2 stars because 2 stars is listed as ""I do not like it""  However what I do not like is his trying to make money off the reputation of ACIM A Course in Miracles book.  He is breaking all the tenants of ACIM by doing so.  He is doing what too many people are doing which is trying to make money off ACIM by writing books and doing seminars as self proclaimed experts in ACIM.  Well Mr Tharp is no expert in ACIM because he is breaking all the rules of ACIM.Mr Tharp like all the other promoters see them selves as Teachers of ACIM when they need to be students of ACIM.  Never teachers.As a student of ACIM you first need to buy the book and work all 365 Daily Lessons one a day for a year.  Then and only then can the reader of his book go to read the next page in Tharp's book.  Step 2 is to recognize you are a student for life and never a self proclaimed teacher.  He is to teach by example silently by his life.  not by preaching.There is no way to use ACIM for the purpose of making money trading.  ACIM would have you walk away from all money.  Lose all interest in making money.  Just the opposite of what he claims.I could go on and on.  This is ridiculous.  I recommend that Tharp end his quest for riches by giving up all his money chasing by proclaiming himself as an expert in changing other people.  ACIM first principle is that he can not change anyone.  in fact he is to accept everyone as perfect just as they are.  He is to work on himself AND ONLY HIMSELF.  absolutely never is he to try to change anyone else.  He is breaking all the concepts of ACIM.  He is no teacher.  He needs first to be a student for life.ACIM says that psychologists like Tharp can not heal anyone. never.  all they can do is change the problem from one expression  to another expression.  but  ACIM is strong on the fact that He can not change or heal anyone.  NO ONE CAN CHANGE ANYONE EXCEPT HIMSELF.If you want to find someone to help you with ACIM then you will find someone who will assist you for free.  He will be awakened and or enlightened.  You should expect to do nothing else but ACIM for several years.  that means more than just giving up trading.  it means giving up everything.  especially one must give up thinking of himself as being a leader of others per what Tharp is doing here.  it is like a sacrilege.You can go online and find meetings all around the world where people meet to share their experience with ACIM and the book.  these should be free.  no one is to try to make money off ACIM.  that is totally in error.I guarantee that Tharp can not teach you ACIM.  IMPOSSIBLE.  What he is doing is distorting everything of ACIM into its OPPOSITE.  What you will learn from Tharp is the OPPOSITE of ACIM.ACIM was not given to us to be used and abused to make money by selling one's opposite opinions of ACIM or to make money trading,  That is just the opposite of what ACIM teaches.  ACIM is not about learning concepts of the book.  IT IS ABOUT HAVING A SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCE FROM READING THE BOOK.What ACIM wants you to embrace is that Money,  Trading,  the World  every thing you see with your eyes.  and more is just an illusion and a FALSE GOD.  so why would god have you make more money which is a false god.  ridiculous.  Tharp is using ACIM to get you more deeply stuck into the world of false gods that he worships.  THARP MUST FIRST HEAL HIMSELF BEFORE HE CAN LOOK TO HEAL ANYONE ELSE.Is ACIM good.  of course.  is it there to make money trading.  NO.  it is to walk away from the world.  to experience that Tharp and everyone is ONE.  So there is not need for Tharp to help anyone because everyone is him.  He needs to love everyone because that is loving himself.  The world is an illusion so how can you make more money when money is an illusion and false god.  Tharp is missing the entire ACIM.  He needs to get busy and work on himself.  which is what he preaches but does not do.  He is like all the other Preachers of the world.  Tharp will never come close to understanding ACIM until well after he stops PREACHING AS A SELF PROCLAIMED GURU EXPERT.  WHAT A LAUGH.Can Tharp as a psychologist write some good ideas.  probably yes.  but he should not use ACIM for his personal financial benefit.  That is wrong.  And I strongly oppose it.  He needs to get his act together.  this is a major error on his part.Many people who go into areas of psychology think they want to help other people.  this is the trap they can not seem to escape from.  Tharp is caught himself in the trap all his life.  it is now time for him to get out of the trap and stop fixing other people and work ACIM on HIMSELF AND NO ONE ELSE.  Something that is probably damn near impossible for him to even start to look at himself.  He is too busy telling everyone else to look at themselves.  Well he is going to be in for a shock when he looks in a mirror and sees who needs to get to work.",0,0,0,0

R1L1MVPWXHXYZ7,"I have completed the awesome feat of actually watching ""Fear and loathing in Las Vegas"" through and I have conducted a major scientific analysis on this flick. I consulted my neighbors who all happen to be  highly esteemed scientists and they provided me with some interesting opinions about what this film might be about. I have to add at this point, that i live in an apartment building inhabited only by sociologists, psychologists, ornithologists and marxists, and i often discuss with them matters of art that seem to escape me. These are the conclusions I gathered from my discussion with them:1. ""Fear and loathing.."" actually DOES have a plot. The fact that a spectacularly overwhelming majority of the audience failed to see the plot is besides the point. The same amount of people also failed to understand Einstein's theory. Be careful though. This does in no respect mean that ""Fear and loathing..."" is an ingenius film much the same as Einstein couldnt direct a film even though he might've been a genius. Get it? Me neither..2.""Fear and loathing..."" has as much of a plot as all David Lynch's films do together. To anyone disputing this or needing it to be explained i recommend the highly succesful detox programm called ""Watch Fear and Loathing again. And Again. Part II"".3. ""Fear and loathing.."" is a state of the art...art film, which actually is filmed real time by a director seriously suspended in between reality scapes and played by actors who are actually beyond tripped out with the purpose of providing us with a complex and therefore difficult to understand map with the limits of the human mind. It could have been French.4. ""Fear and Loathing..."" is NOT a film. It is actually part of a secret government programm aimed at discouraging our youth in experimenting with a plethora of different drugs simoultaneously. Judging from the reviews here though the programm has failed. Your tax dollars at work once again.5. ""Fear and Loathing..."" will be undisputably understood when Part Two is released (Fear and Loathing in Modevideo) which is due for release in 50 years time. Those alive till then will be awed at the cosmogonic meaning of this film and will ultimately understand how silly they were when they were young and missed the idea because of their naivity.6. ""Fear and Loathing"" is actually an alien film recovered during a UFO crash in South Siberia. The original has -of course- been kept from the public eye and this an adaptation providing us with a glipse into the alien mindset. Did you notice the scene at the beginning with the reptiles at the bar. Well, WINK! Do we have to spell it out for ya????  I do admit that the aforementioned analysis theses are somewhat contradicting. But, I must also admit that i consider myself to be intellectually inadequate to pinpoint which one comes closest to the truth. I think that in reality we all are.

You relate less and less well to others, to whom you show evermore coldness, anger, disdain and general ill-feeling. You are in a constantly bad mood, constantly vying for power, constantly feeling miffed and disrespected, constantly showing that you are the best at everything including scuba diving on New Year's Eve without your license, so that you are unable to enjoy even the cottage your colleague Dr. Mant lent you. There is never enough hot water for you, not even in the women's washroom of a dock/naval/abandoned ship facility.Your author obviously cares little about the image you project anymore.

R22BGIS4HAWKLB,"To paraphrase a famous quotation, ""Fair Tax"" is a dream, wrapped in a fantasy, inside a fairy-tale.  It is amazing and perhaps disheartening that so many seemingly intelligent and educated people have been deceived by the dream. Most of the defenders are people who have never looked beyond the fairy-tale: A simple tax, replacing the insane complexity of the current system.  The only excuse one can find for them is that these people look at ""Fair Tax"" as if it were an abstract concept.  If there were no economy, no people earning money and using them for purchasing, and we just created a society, then a consumption tax for the new economy might be worth considering.A book review, however, is not the right place for a discussion of the fundamental merits of a tax system.  Let's leave that to the economy theorists.  For the sake of the discussion (only), let's grant the authors the premises about embedded taxes and their (debatable) role in setting the price of goods.  Most definitely, let's set aside the endless, asinine arguing about whether to cite the consumption tax inclusively or exclusively, and even what the actual percentage would be.  Who cares?  As the authors correctly state, the only thing that really should matter to people is the purchasing power, and the generated revenue.It is appropriate, however, to evaluate the way the authors are making the case for ""FairTax"", the validity of their arguments. They write not about an abstract concept, but about a real switch to a new tax system.Perhaps the most insidious and deceitful feature of Boortz and Linder's book and arguments is the use of averages.  It starts with the ""embedded tax."" ""In The FairTax Book we wrote extensively about a Harvard University study that showed that, on average, about 22 percent of what you pay for any consumer item or service represents the embedded costs in that item ..."" (p. 29). The authors briefly mention, in this and the first book, that the actual embedded costs vary from industry to industry, but they do not bother to tell us how much.  A simple consideration would tell them and us that the range must be considerable, and that it also must vary widely from product to product in the same industry, and is different for the same type of product made by different companies.Why is that important? Because if those different percentages of embedded costs were replaced by a single, constant ""FairTax"" percentage, it would cause an unbelievable upheaval of the market as well as redistribution of the purchasing power of the population.  Since, according to the authors, the embedded costs are mostly due to the tax burden of the employees involved, industries or companies with high mechanization and therefore low embedded costs would see their products burdened with a higher consumption tax than what their previous embedded costs used to be, while those with high embedded costs because of a large workforce would be at an advantage. The switch would penalize productivity.Let's consider a simple example of two companies, making the same type of product, and let's assume that the production costs, excluding labor costs, are the same and that the final products are equivalent in quality.  One company has a more efficiently organized production line, requiring a minimum of workers, and thus has lower labor costs, and therefore lower ""embedded tax costs"". Because of the competitive pressure both products sell for the same price, so that the more productive company shows higher profit.  What would be the effect of replacing the ""embedded tax costs"" with a universal ""FairTax"" percentage? With the same purchasing price again, the relative profit margin of the more productive company would fall.What about the effect on the purchasing public?  Are we all just averages, everybody buying the same things? If products with currently high embedded costs satisfied your needs and lifestyle, you might perhaps see prices go lower, but if you preferred mostly the low-embedded cost products, you would be out of luck.  Is that supposed to be fair and reasonable?One of the most deceitful claims, which I heard Mr. Boortz to make on radio, and which is repeated in the book, is about the effect on retirees, who live on their savings.  On radio, Mr. Boortz assured a caller that since FairTax would just replace the embedded tax, the prices would remain the same, so that there would be no change for his retired parents.  In the book (p.190), the authors breezily assert: ""... either you're going to pay the embedded taxes that lurk in every product and service you consume, or you're going to pay the FairTax. Six to one, half-dozen of the other."" And: ""Everything you buy with those savings is going to cost pretty much the same - plus you'll have that prebate check every month.""Here one must note that the authors certainly are not guilty of consistency.  Throughout the book you can find any and all predictions about the change in the costs of products if ""Fairtax"" were instituted.  Side by side with this ""pretty much the same"" statement repeated several times the authors mostly claim that the prices would get lower.  But occasionally they slip: ""For example, one macroeconomic study of the FairTax- a study that assumed that the employer's share of the payroll tax is the only savings that will be used to lower prices - estimated that prices would rise by 24.8 percent but wages would rise by 27.4 percent, more than compensating for the increase in prices."" (p. 144).If the study is correct, what will be the effect on the retirees living on fixed income from savings, who do not have wages that might rise?  Somewhere recently Mr. Boortz has faced this question, and played a little different tune: The retirees mostly get money by withdrawing from their investments, and they pay income tax on those withdrawals, so they get the relief there.  Really? What about those who have invested in Roth IRA, or another form of non-taxable savings?  Even if many or even most people paid some income tax as retirees, could we simply write out those who do not, ""let them eat cake""?Even people with IQ in the range of low Lottery numbers must wonder how the ""FairTax could  be ""revenue neutral,"" when the government loses the major source of revenue - the income taxes - while collecting a sales tax that replaces the ""embedded taxes,"" which presumably are derived in part from income taxes, but cannot account for all of them, and the prices get lower. But then we learn that, of course, services will be taxed.  Retirees take note: you will be paying more for those, many of you without the benefit of an income tax relief. And again we hear the argument: The cost of services includes ""embedded taxes.""  How much and how variable? Do you use and need services with currently low embedded tax costs?  Tough luck.When it comes to fairytales, the Boortz/Linder prediction about what would happen with prices and wages if ""FairTax"" were instituted takes the prize. Following are, summarized, their conclusions (pp. 75-76):Scenario one: Employees will be getting the same ""take home check"" (net salary). Employer would save the amount withheld for federal income taxes, SS taxes. Medicare taxes.  This will result in reduction of price of products or services.Scenario two: Paychecks will be increased by the previous matching contributions. Employees will keep withholdings. The price ""wouldn't be reduced by the full amount of the embedded taxes.""And then we get from the authors the astounding prediction (pp. 77-78):""Actually, it would most likely be a combination of the two [scenarios]: In some workplaces the savings would be passed down the line and the cost of the final products would be reduced accordingly.  In other cases, the workers would retain that tax burden plus their share of the Social Security and Medicare taxes.  Their businesses wouldn't see prices go down quite as much.""Are the authors joking, or are they certifiably insane? The workers of the second (scenario) group would see increased paychecks, and get an enormously increased purchasing power for the products made by the first group workers, the prices of which are supposed to drop substantially.  The workers of the first group would be totally out of luck.  They could buy the products of the companies that had made the decision to use the savings to lower the prices, but could hardly afford to buy the products of the other group.  Do the authors assume that people purchase only products of the companies they work for?Logical, rational? In your dreams!",0,0,0,0
R2HL6MAM4TY310,"Firstly must say this was delivered promptly, so in no way does this review reflect on the seller.I bought this because I thought a man who lived to 93, and a scientist to boot, must have some words of wisdom to impart.  He did.  but not very many.  These could be summed up as; don't smoke, take moderate exercise, avoid sugar, don't drink too much and eat a sensible diet.  I didn't need to buy this book to find this out.Against that there was constant advice to drown yourself in Vit C, in doses some might regard as toxic, and take large amounts of other vitamins.The (very slim) chapter on ageing contained nothing that a moderately well informed reader of women's magazines or other literature wouldn't know already.  In addition there was little mention of research into, as just one example, into Vit K, which he seems to regard as just one vitamin and solely responsible for blood clotting (K1) and nothing at all about Vit K2 and its properties.  This information would have been available in his lifetime so this is sloppy research.I appreciate that the role of gut flora may not have been well advanced in his day, but any update ought to have at least referred the reader to this.Very disappointed.",0,0,0,0

RV2H0SJEFHM4F,"Because I don't want any of the fancy wireless/smart fitness tracker watches, but only need something that will check heart rate  and count distance and steps for a walking regimen, this affordable watch seemed to fit the bill perfectly. However, I discovered the following:It consistently overcounted the distance, even when checked against a regulation measured track. For instance it read a measured .25 mile as .33 mile. But since I do most of my walking on said highschool track, that wasn't a deal killer.It also overcounted my steps, despite my having entered all the proper info into the watch's Setup. Overcounting ranged from 50 steps to more than 100. Not good but I resigned myself to not paying attention to ""steps"" anymore. Still, irksome.At least the heart rate monitor worked. Until it completely stopped working after less than 2 weeks of use (and ""use"" meaning one walk per day, not wearing it 24/7 either). The heart rate function would activite but then simply flash blankly, with no readout, until it automatically reset itself to display the time. Since the heart rate monitor is the most important function for me, this renders the watch useless.Thus, it's going back for a refund. No idea which one I will try next, because I can't afford to spend $200+ on one of the bells-and-whistles models (don't have a smartphone anyway) and cannot wear a chest strap style monitor.Guess you get what you pay for.",0,0,0,0
RS7YBUMHS55MO,"So, I bought this two days ago - for $39.99 (From my order history)  Circleware 69134 Triple XL Tall Yorkshire Chalkboard Glass Beverage Drink Dispensers with Lids and White Metal Stand, 80 oz. each, Copper, Gold and Silver Chalkboard Panels Sold by: Amazon.com Services, Inc Return eligible through Sep 23, 2018 $39.99.  There was literally 1 review that it was smashed when they got it.  I REALLY need this for a party for next weekend.  There is a similar one with the 'chalkboard' on top and a black stand, but I wasn't sure to get it in time.  Anyway - I figured I'd risk it.  It showed up on time, and NOT smashed.  Happy!  The stand on the other hand - I think any kid in high school metals could have welded it better.  It's SUPER crooked, so one jug leans to the front, one to the side - even though there's ample room for 3 jugs to not be touching, it's such awful craftsmanship, there's no way to make it happen.  Figured ""Well, I'll try another one and return the bent stand"".  HA!  And then see it's now over $55!!!!  It is *NOT* *AT* *ALL* worth $55.  $40 is pushing it.  But seriously - a 40% markup???? (I bet you're paying for the 'free' shipping)  It does LOOK beautiful if you can get beyond the ""straight"" part of things.  Something being off-kilter REALLY sticks out for me, so it'll bug me forever.  I just got it so haven't actually USED it yet - question whether it'll create a vacuum over time since there are no air holes, but it will suit the current need.  VERY disappointing quality of the stand.  The jar seals are sort of all over the place - super tight, just tight enough - Simply low quality.  Too bad, I REALLY wanted to love it!",0,0,0,0

R13LGSU6FP5A42,"Before you read the one ""Perfect"" review, please read mine. I was very happy to find this scale to work with my Endicia Account and my Dymo LabelWriter 4XL. Upon arrival I shipped my first package. When we took the package to the U.S. Post Office, they weighed the package and declared that it was 5.6 more ounces and would cost more money to ship. This defeated the purpose of purchasing and printing postage.  So I called Dymo and their customer service was very nice and after over an hour on the phone they told me that the scale must be defective and will be replaced. So I received a new one today, and the new scale is exactly the same. I was told by Dymo to use weights from a gym as a constant to weigh on the scale. When I put 40 lbs on the old scale and the new scale and they both displayed 39 lbs. This is totally unacceptable to be 1lb off from the actual weight. So when I use this scale it will always print the wrong postage.  The manual says the fluctuation is +-.4lb but it is more in some cases.  Dymo should really produce a more accurate scale, especially if you are using it connected to a computer through USB and using the Endicia software.  For our company, this scale is totally unusable. I am quite surprised that Dymo would put out a product that does not display the proper weight. Save yourself the trouble and get another scale.",0,0,0,0

R2OFA7CRXZ2R2O,"The first film, simply called Sherlock Holmes, was a super film in all regards, writing, acting, directing and story line. I first saw this eagerly awaited second film, A Game of Shadows, film in the cinema and was greatly disappointed. However, when the price of the DVD was sufficiently low I decided to give it another chance. I have to report that my initial view was correct. This is a badly written, and lacking in any involvement. Lots of bangs but little else. The principal two actors seemed as though they just could not be bothered. One wonders if they were co-erced by contract into doing a remake. There was no rapport between them and which is essential in this kind of film where a lot of the laughs depend on the interaction between the actors. The writing was little less than appalling: the script could have been written on the back of of a postage stamp.As for the naked scene with Stephen Fry the less said the better. It was a complete irrelevance to the film. Why Mr Ritchie was it included? It added nothing to the story line and was not even funny.I struggle to give this two stars.",0,0,0,0

R2AC3GXJUTRMTO,"When I was at school, we were made to read a book called ""The Dark is Rising"". I thought that was the worst book I'd ever read, and it held it's title for a long time (I'm 27 now) - but compared to the Tao of Pooh it shines like a glimmering beacon of success in the puss filled mire of Hoff's seemingly limitless inadequacy as a writer.Unfortunately, Amazon.com won't allow me to put less than one star, but given the choice I'd rate this book in minus figures.What I'm going to suggest though, is that if you are an intelligent person, please do read this book so that you may contribute along with me in diminishing the completely unjustified acclaim it holds.At the end of this book, I understand very little about Taoism, as I would hope that it is vastly more interesting and holds less prejudice and small-mindedness as Hoff suggests. If anything, the book is far more representational of facist and racist views. To suggest that knowledgeable people, or people who strive to gain knowledge are stupid in their quest, is quite frankly ludicrous.The book is basically saying, if you're thick and stupid and have limited room for thought, if you only look for simple things because you're too incompetent to strive to achieve, then you'll be happy.

RF0CX3TFB62Y6,"Possible spoilers.  For me there are a few films that created benchmarks in the advancement of science fiction films.  “Dune” isn’t one of them.  Without going into detail, I would nominated “Metropolis,” a 1927 silent film directed by Fritz Lang, “2001: A Space Odyssey” (1968) directed by Stanley Kubrick, “Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope” (1977), George Lucas’s blockbuster and “Blade Runner” (1982) directed by Ridley Scott.  Ironically Scott was set to direct “Dune” but he dropped out after his brother died.  “Dune” was going to be a long project so he went with “Blade Runner” which was ready for production.  Actress Sean Young who had a major role in “Blade Runner” plays Chani in “Dune.”  In another connection, Denis Villeneuve who directed the “Blade Runner” sequel “Blade Runner 2049” is directing a new version of “Dune” scheduled for release later this year.All that aside “Dune” tells the story of competing forces in the year 10191 looking to control the Universe which can more easily be done by controlling the planet Arrakis also known as Dune.  It is the source of a substance known as “spice,” specifically Melange.  It seems this movie, based on Frank Herbert’s novel, has 2 names for everything and everyone.  The people who live on Arrakis are not warriors and live under the surface mining the spice.From what I could gather, there are 2 forces in competition to control the planet thus the spice.  So you might ask what the spice is good for.  Well in addition to providing a good buzz (expanding the consciousness) it also has the power to extend life and even fold space.  That last tidbit makes travelling around the Universe a lot easier which makes imperialism easier as all sci-fi aficionados already know.The good guys are led by the Atreides family, Duke Leto (Jurgen Prochnow), Lady Jessica (Francesca Annis) and their son, Paul (Kyle MacLachlan).  The bad guys report to an evil emperor called Shaddam Corrino (Jose Ferrer).  While Corrino appears to be working with the Duke, he’s secretly planning a confrontation between the Atredes and their sworn enemy, the Harkonnens, led by a floating corpulent man full of ginormous facial zits named Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Kenneth McMillan).  Don’t plan on eating when he’s on screen.So the battle is staged for a fight on Arrakis.  By now most film watchers of modern action based sci-fi are used to unusual names of people and planets, so we should be able to move past that.  The film is directed by David Lynch who also wrote the screenplay and is something he doesn’t want to talk about.  He says he didn’t get final approval.  Maybe so, but what is put on the screen is a mess, not only in understandability (is that a word?) but it mostly just plunders along in boring fashion.  Make sure you’re perked up when watching or you’ll soon be nodding off.I also found it surprising to find some of the special effects/CGI to be very good and others resorting to tricks from the 1960s.  Sometimes even in the same sequence.  The cast is large and many will find their way into other David Lynch projects including “Twin Peaks” like MacLachlan in his screen debut, Brad Dourif, Everett McGill, Jack Nance and Dean Stockwell.  Also watch for Oscar winner Linda Hunt, Virginia Madsen as young Princess Irulan, Patrick Stewart, Capt. Picard himself, musician Sting, Max von Sydow and Alicia Witt who was about 7 at the time.

The difference is that in the real biographies, the information is given in context--both in context with the time period in which it occurred and in context with the other events surrounding what happened.There is simply too much wrong with this book to even begin to address it all except to say that it is disheartening and sickening.

However, he wasn't evil incarnate either.Read a couple of decent, even-handed biographies about Lincoln--ones that are neither hero-worshipping nor hit pieces.  This piece of trash written by Dilorenzo will look a lot different after carefully examining for yourself how the comments and events he uses to try and destroy Lincoln's character actually came about.It's saddening to think that there will be many who will not do any personal research, and will take this mishmash of Dilorenzo's as some sort of true revelation about Lincoln's actual character.  I can't imagine what sort of pathetic need for money or supposed fame could possibly possess someone to write such a thing.",0,0,0,0
RT59X17ASCQKQ,"The product should not be advertised as ""professional"" grade. We looked for reviews prior and they seemed good on-line. Giving one star as this is very far from a professional grade unit.When we tried to slice a small ham, the plastic guide was not easy to place/use and is made of cheap plastic. The slider and tray are also cheap plastic and the whole mechanism does not slide easily. However, the whole unit DOES slide easily with any significant pressure to push a piece of meat across the blade-I had to help my wife and hold the unit.Also, the blade appears to spin too slowly compared to other units we have used which in turn seems to make slicing harder than it should be.Lastly, the unit is not the greatest to clean out either as there is a crease in the steel housing etc and the housing is not able to be taken apart by regular users.",0,0,0,0

RJ4U12LSC3CEY,"This review is about my experience and not a review of the planner itself as I have not been able to use it yet. I ordered direct from their website.I ordered the A5 size planner because I like to carry it with me, like a journal, pretty much how it is intended, I don't like the bulky B5's and haven't used one for that reason, which is why I was actually a PassionPlanner user for many years. So I was excited about the A5 in freedom mastery, I've been watching their company grow for years, and just waiting for the smaller planner size. What I didn't know when I purchased the A5 was that the layout was completely different than the B5. It is not very obvious in the details nor in the ""description"" which is a generic video that reviews the B5 size. So I ordered the A5 size assuming it was the same layout. NOPE, 1. all the months are in the front part of the planner, and 2. the weeks are not ""5a-10:30pm"" time slots, they are just blocks of days that are stacked, e.g. block for monday, tuesday and weds on the left page, then on the right page thurs, fri, sat, sun. there are little checkboxes on the left edge with a "" : "", I presume for entering your own time.So, I requested a return given it was unclear that the layouts weren't the same. Well I ordered the planner on 10/3/20, received it on 10/8/2020, and on 10/9/2020 I requested a return. I got an email saying they'll get back to me soon and gave a ticket for tracking progress. I kept checking the ticket and it said status: ""awaiting your reply"". So I figured they were super busy, but literally 2 weeks in I was getting impatient. So on the ticket I indicated I was still waiting to get a response. The next day, still no response, so then I thought ""awaiting your reply"", was there something I missed? Was there something I was supposed to reply to? So I wrote again, saying just that. Then I get this email, generic type ""we see you've gotten the planner, tell us how it is"" type thing, so I responded ""still waiting on a response from my first question. This is 10/23/20 by the way, they finally respond and apologize profusely, asking if I want a return they'd refund, but I'd have to pay for shipping, but if I wanted an exchange they would wave the shipping for the new item. I thought that was reasonable. So I responded around 10/26 that I was willing to try the B5 since I was still interested in the planners process. They responded that I would get a separate email with an RMA#. But there was no comment on the planner I was wanting in exchange...now 10/29, still no email with RMA#, so I wrote back again, they said I should have gotten an email from UPS, but nope, checked spam, trash, inbox, with every variation of searches for ""UPS"" ""RMA"" and the number they gave me...nothing.

R5OLV2098T5PC,"My review and rating are overall for the entire trilogy, so:SPOILER ALERTThe first book, The Strain, was very interesting, in my opinion. It added this element to vampirism that is rarely seen, and this would of course be the scientific background provided. I was impressed with the extent and dedication to reality with which the authors aimed for with explaining the disease as, just that, a disease. Albeit, it's questionable at parts, but overall fairly logical. However, this logic is quickly strained as one comes to realize that a supposed natural virus is specifically weakened by any object made of silver, for whatever reason, and that it cannot cross over moving water...without the assistance of a human...Which leads one to wonder, what makes a human, one species of millions, so special that it can permit another species to cross over moving water. All in all, the first book was the most enjoyable of the three, and the most grounded in reality, but, as stated before, it quickly loses this base of reality with its supernatural tendencies and lore.The second book, The Fall, had questionable and odd actions being carried on. And one is forced to wonder: Why doesn't Eph kill his ex-wife to prevent her from locating him and his son? How is one organization able to influence the government and media so strongly so as to obscure the truth about the epidemic from being truthfully portrayed to the public? How would a man so powerful and accustomed to control be so gullible in his endeavours pertaining to the master and his true intent? How is the Master unable to obtain one book, one single tome from a known location, in a city that he controls and basically has dominion over?...and the questions go on and on. Then, of course, there is the issue with Nora being deemed the babysitter and caretaker, while all of the men go about doing the rough work and hunting. This book also continues with the waning of logic, as it is discovered that once an Ancient, or even the Master, is destroyed, every vampire created by that individual will recede with it. I understand that the Ancients and the Master have a hive mentality with their minions, but when the Queen ant or Queen bee dies, her lesser insects do not disintegrate or die along with her, and since these are supposed to be natural creatures, they should be subjected to natural laws. One final thing about this book, while the reader knows why the first book is called The Strain and knows why the third book is called Night Eternal, the reader does not know the reason for the second book's title until the ending, in which humanity experiences 'The Fall'.Finally, the third book, Night Eternal, just throws away all logic and scientific background developed previously. Somehow, after informing the reader that the vampire virus is a natural one with biologically correct possibilities, one is now left to digest that the climax of the series is religious. At this point, all credibility is thrown away and caution given to the wind. The origin of the vampire virus is not natural, it is supernatural: the seven vampires emerged from the severed body parts of a fallen archangel that was torn apart by other archangels shortly after Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed because said archangel killed one of his companions. If you value the science included in the first book, be warned, it's all given over to Judeo-Christian folklore and supernatural hoo-haa. Then, once the Master is finally defeated, all seven parts of the angel are somehow put back together and the archangel is allowed back into heaven, even though he killed a woman in Sodom and his own companion. All in all, it was a very disappointing turn of events.",0,0,0,0

R2IZAGWAAIWYZO,"Another example of how a simple. inexpensive product has been ruined by cutting corners.

R1Y9FSHCYSV8Y2,"Review courtesy of Dark Faerie TalesQuick & Dirty: This main character grated on my nerves, but other than her, the story bored me half to death.Opening Sentence: Viv stood in front of the mirror, painstakingly sabotaging her appearance.The Review:Vivian is trapped in a Snow White curse. It’s not a pleasant one. She’s doomed to one of two lives — one in which her love, who was deemed the Huntsman, kills her, or one in which he lets her live on only to watch her marry another. When she gets an invitation to the underworld, she meets the boy cursed to be her prince, who offers her a safe haven in his palace where they can delay the inevitable. But try as she might, Viv is not in love with Jasper. She’s in love with the one who will cut out her heart or leave her forever. Which choice is better? Is there any way to break her curse, or is fate something that cannot be escaped?I’ve been stuck with Tear You Apart for months. At one point, it took weeks to get from 30 percent to 35. Here I am, at 60 percent, after trudging my way through each never-ending page. I accept defeat. I simply am not enjoying the book. I no longer care for how Viv’s life ends up. Honestly? I’d be fine if she died in the end in an unexpected twist. At least it would be interesting. I have no interest in the characters, the plotline, or the world. I bear them no ill will, either — it wasn’t a problem with me hating the book, it was a problem with me being unable to find a reason to read on. I can say with complete honesty that Tear You Apart bored my socks off. I can also say that is the first and last time I will ever use that figure of speech. My review today will be short and sweet, because I have no interest on dwelling on this failed read any longer than necessary.Vivian was a boring character to me. She was dull. She whined. She invoked the only emotion I felt with anyone in this story: irritation. She constantly withered in her self-pity bubble. No one or nothing else really mattered but her plight. She was pointless and I didn’t find a sliver of connection between me and Viv. Isn’t she supposed to be caring about the birdies and the dwarves, being Snow White? Nah, she’ll just be sad about herself. Her relationship with Huntley was where I really started to dislike her. She was so unkind to him! They have a history, and she’s not helping her whole “don’t kill me” case by pushing him away and being generally bitchy, forgive my language. Maybe if I had stuck it out for the rest of the book, I might have seen Vivian’s redemption, but I just can’t imagine a world in which Vivian and Huntley (whom she “loves”) are a good couple.The wicked stepmother was the only character in the story whom I liked. She had motivations, and a backstory to match. Her intentions were evil, but there were underlying themes to her character, perhaps the one thing in the book done right. Viv is so hypocritical concerning Regina, (they mooched the Once Upon a Time stepmother name!) going off and off about how she didn’t choose her curse, when Regina didn’t either. She grew up believing she was Snow White. Do you think she felt happy knowing that she’d been labeled evil? It was a self-fulfilling prophecy. She didn’t have the most pleasant life either. She gave into darkness to protect the part of her that hurt so badly when she heard of her husband cheating on her, or heard the mirror tell her that Vivian was prettier than she was.Okay, altogether, not my favorite novel. There were barely any merits that I can name. I was so bored! The pacing seemed slow. And there’s this beautiful, horrible, unique world, one that (had it been done better) I would have appreciated. It was like the Once Upon a Time world with more modern technology and multiple versions of the same characters. I wasn’t able to enjoy the world. Maybe the fact that I didn’t read Kill Me Softly before I read this changed my opinion, because I know many people loved that one. Oh, and this book almost became the only book that’s ever put me to sleep! Congratulations! I was reading Tear You Apart and then realized the book was slipping from my hands and my eyes were closing. I snapped out of it and turned off the Kindle to protect its battery life before giving into the snooze fest. I wouldn’t recommend this unless you liked Kill Me Softly. Perhaps you’ll like this one as well.Notable Scene:True love’s kiss was supposed to be natural between a cursed prince and princess. You were supposed to feel like you’d known each other a lifetime. But Viv knew what it felt like to know someone your whole life and to love him, and it didn’t feel like this.Fate and magic were supposed to bind them together, but she felt like her heart had been cut from her chest.FTC Advisory: EgmontUSA provided me with a copy of Tear You Apart.

R3CPUPYY4YEAOO,"I've been using Hatchbox PLA without fail for a long time. So I wanted to try their PETG. Here are some of my thoughts:DISCLOSURE: Yes, I understand PETG is different than PLA and is notorious for being difficult to print.My experience:I have an ABL unit on my Ender 3 Pro w/ all metal hotend and despite making sure my bed was perfectly level, laying down some extra adhesive, and finding the optimal nozzle distance from the bed, the first layer won't stick!It might stick for a while...but then it shifts out of the way. (70-75C bed temp)Aside from bed adhesion issues, this brand of PETG absorbs moisture like nothing else I've ever seen. When doing a temperature tower, the entire tower was ""rough"" from the boiling water in the filament coupled by the sound of crackling as it came out of the nozzle. Despite drying it for several days in a dehydrator (which improved results slightly), if left out for a day, my results would go back to the garbage that they were.Even while conducting a retraction test, the bubbling remained present and there was no significant change in stringing.CONCLUSION:I really want to give this a positive review. But this is my first experience with PETG, and I have done my due diligence by going through every single troubleshooting method there is. Both at the printer level and slicer level. The fact that I've seen zero change in quality and consistency tells me it's an issue with Hatchbox. Either their formula is garbage or I just got a bad batch...Sorry guys. :(I'll continue to buy their PLA cuz it's awesome. But this PETG needs work.",0,0,0,0
R3AI07P0HY2B31,"I enjoyed the Duggars' first book and think there are many positive things about their family. While some of their beliefs are controversial, it's good for people to be able to learn about different lifestyles and ideas, including ones that are considered unusual or extreme. So I was looking forward to reading this second book by the Duggars.I was disappointed to find that many of the topics were already discussed in the first book. Nothing is repeated word for word, but there aren't many new insights either. Several chapters simply recount events that have appeared on the show, again presenting very little that viewers don't already know about the Duggars' lives.Although there's a lot of overlap between this book and the first, this one is less enjoyable for a number of reasons. For one thing, the tone is a bit defensive--sometimes laughably so. As another reviewer pointed out, the healthy recipes in A Love That Multiplies seem like a response to the criticism the Duggars have received about high-fat meals. But that's not all. The first book included a picture of the boys eating donuts; the exact same picture is reprinted in this book, with a new caption that says they usually snack on fruits and vegetables and enjoy donuts only ""occasionally"". The first book included a story about Michelle learning to discipline the children in a calm and patient way; this book features the same story, with the added detail that the kids were eating pineapple for a snack when the incident occurred. There's even a little sidebar that warns parents to be careful that the food found in their kitchens is healthy enough. I understand that there are a lot of accusations made against the Duggars and the family is justified in responding, but A Love That Multiplies goes overboard in answering everything, and it detracts from the experience of reading the book.The tone is a bit more preachy than in the first. There are a lot more Bible verses, lots of references to people ""sharing hearts,"" and some not-very-good inspirational poetry. There are pages of warnings and instructions to parents, including sections about seemingly obvious relationship skills that are fairly boring. The Duggars start off the book by stating that they're not perfect, but unlike in the first book, we don't see many instances of them struggling or learning from mistakes. Instead, they react with prayer and a positive attitude to just about every challenge that comes along. This made them harder to relate to in A Love That Multiplies.The book would have been better if it had included more information about the individual children's interests and goals. On the show, viewers watch the children pursue projects and listen to interviews with one or two of them at a time. In A Love That Multiplies, the children are all lumped together and the reader learns little about them as individuals. Well, we do learn some things about them. There's a comment about the timing of the older girls' menstrual cycles, and there's a story about Jinger's diary being stolen by an unscrupulous fan. But I'm not interested in their bodily functions or times when the kids were victims. I want to learn about times when the kids took the initiative and accomplished things. There's very little of that in this book, other than a short section on Josh's car lot and some vague references to midwifery training for the girls.There are also a few sections that should have been completely removed. In particular, some things in the section about sex were really creepy. It presents a story Jim Bob tells that's supposed to emphasize the importance of purity. The story compares someone whose purity has been ""stolen"" to a beat-up bicycle that doesn't make a good present. I found the implication that people who have lost their virginity are damaged goods to be very offensive. That section also states that Jim Bob regularly checks up on the boys to ask if they're having problems with impure thoughts. I cringed when I read that part. Perhaps some explanation would have made this section more palatable, but I don't think it had to be there at all given that the Duggars have already widely publicized their views on sex and morality.Thus, I'd recommend that people who want to learn more about the Duggars stick with the first book or just watch the show.",0,0,0,0

I bought the Lactic Acid serum for $95.00 online from this spa as I heard great reviews by Lisa Eldridge, famous make up artist and youtube guru who was probably paid by this spa to review their product but unknowingly I was a sucker for love of all things skin care. I really trusted this would be a great product, however when I received it, the tube was literally a 10 pump max tube and the actual product smelled straight like perfume. I don't think anything that should be good for your skin should have so much fragrance in it. However, I did give it a try, I used small amounts of it as my skin is super thick and can handle most anything. oh no not this product, I broke out in huge cystic acne in odd places such as the left side of my face right by my eye. It literally is taking me 2 months to get rid of the side effects. I was VERY disappointed in a small product with big promise at an outrageous retail price point. As well, since I ordered it online and did not read any small print they would not return the product. :( So now I am stuck with tons of Cystic Acne still on the side of my face and $95.00 in the hole! I feel like I have been robbed. I asked them if they would accept the return but since it has been over the 30 days I can not. I didn't know I had 30 days as most places accept returns no questions asked at any time. I am so used to awesome customer service like at Sephora and ULTA that I am not accustomed to mom and pop shops on rodeo drive that will not take returns beyond the 30 days.

R3DWISPB76TFP7,"First things first, let me just say: I LOVE Christmas Vacation. I have it on DVD, and it is not christmas at my house until I've seen it at least 50 times (that's right). In fact, I could quote it until everybody who reads this is green in the face.But all this movie did was two things: take two hours of my life which I will never get back, and teach me that Cousin Eddie only works as a SUPPORTING CHARACTER. I should have spent last December 22nd watching the christmas lights flicker on and off. At least THAT'S amusing for a couple of seconds.The movie actually starts off with a couple of laughs. It almost misleads you into thinking this won't be so bad. But right around when they get shipwrecked on the island is when it starts to fall apart like a chinese motorcycle. From there on it is: too long, predictable, not funny, and did I mention it drags on too long? In case I didn't: IT DRAGS ON TOO LONG. We couldn't wait for it to end.Sorry, I really wanted to like it, but my whole family agreed that it's just lousy. There were barely any chuckles to be had.

However, the service is not that great of a deal, overall. I paid for the equipment upfront, I pay about $6/mo in taxes and, to get the essential call-blocking features, I have to pay an additional $10/mo. The basic service isn't compatible with Nomorobo so there is literally no soft-option for call blocking with Ooma basic and that is really aggravating. I'll have to cough up more monthly fees or buy another piece of hardware. All considering, there are other VOIP providers who would have made more economic sense.

R2NFV8RS9900V6,"I can see where Ms. Roach probably found herself a bit cornered while exploring the subject of life after death. First, she doesn't want to turn this book into a sprawling tome that explores the meaning of human existence. She also doesn't want to go down the long road of exploring every spiritual quest ever taken on by humanity. Then there are considerations regarding strongly held religious feelings; you don't want to step on the wrong toes. So, I think Ms. Roach took the right approach to the book in exploring a few areas of possible interest, looking at them as objectively as possible and seeing if anything raises an eyebrow.So, the shortcomings of ""Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife"" may not be so much the fault of the author. If you've ever watched a Bigfoot documentary, you know that you're going to be disappointed if you expect some hunter to emerge from the woods with an eight foot tall ape-man on a leash. Also, you know that the blurry footage is a guy in a gorilla suit, no matter how much you'd like to believe otherwise. These documentaries always jazz up the footage with a little editing and some scary music. That's because simply showing how unrealistic it is to believe in Bigfoot after all this time doesn't make for entertaining viewing. They're taking advantage of us because we want to be taken advantage of, just a little.Mary Roach respects us more than that and gives us what she can. Unfortunately, it doesn't make for very entertaining reading. The one thing that was really missing for me was that feeling of ""Aha!"". I understood that Ms. Roach couldn't take on everything regarding the subject but I wished it had been a little wider in scope. I would've liked a little more philosophical exploration and perhaps a bit of sociological and psychological examination regarding our views on death. I'm not suggesting Roach should have done an Elizabeth Kubler Ross examination on the process of dying or re-written ""Being and Nothingness"", but something to chew on in those areas wouldn't have been bad.I think there might have been a little more to touch on regarding the subject other than debunking soul weighers and psychic mediums. For instance, the culturally independent archetypes that we all share, or the discoveries in physics, mathematics, biology and philosophy that entice us to believe that there may be a God or at least a design. Then again, this book isn't called ""Science tackles God"", its called ""Science tackles the Afterlife"", but the discussion of one seems to so inevitably tie into the other, which once again leads to the complications I mentioned above.I can't let the author completely off the hook, though. ""Spook"" pales in comparison to Carl Sagan's ""The Demon Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark"", a book that deals with similar subject matter, and more, in a more thought provoking manner.  I also have a new rule regarding review snippets claiming a book to be ""Hillarious!""; they are never ""Hillarious!"". I think ""Hillarious!"" is book-critic speak for ""the author makes occasional off-the-cuff comments."" Then again, Roach didn't need to re-write ""The Demon Haunted World"" and I don't get the impression that she would claim herself to be ""hillarious!"" Perhaps my greatest criticism of Roach's approach is that she sacrifices some of the exploration previously mentioned for long, detailed accountings of her research. I think she could have convinced the reader that she thoroughly explored the subject without giving us so much detail. She may have mistaken our enthusiasm for her own when it came to the minutiae of her subject. The few inset diagrams and photos never seem to get to the heart of what we want drawn out. Maybe she could have even stepped on a toe or two. Also, I don't know that science tackles the afterlife so much in ""Spook"" as does a healthy skepiticism. This is another trap; you really can't ""prove"" a negative.""Tackling the afterlife"" may look like a wellspring to a writer looking for a subject, but it turns into a blind alley. I can't say that its entirely the author's fault, and I wouldn't dismiss other work from Mary Roach, but ""Spook"" never really finds its footing. I don't think that anyone expects to find the truth of our human destiny in this book, but they won't find much else, either. Inviting as this book may seem, both skeptics and those looking for something more than life has to offer will be disappointed.",0,0,0,0

R3IZO0E71R2P58,"First, I'll issue a warning: there will be some spoilers in this review. You've been warned.Now, I've been eying this book for some time. It is small, so it doesn't take too much of your time hostage(in comparison to, say, a 900-page epic). It is one of the most famous works of science fiction ever written. Moreover, I'd been wanting to read something by its author, Arthur C. Clarke, for awhile now. I'd read a few short stories written by him, but nothing of any great significance. So this was the perfect place for me to start on my literary journey with Mr. Clarke.Or so I thought.I can't imagine that a writer as famous as Clarke could produce more than one novel as bad as this. And this is one of his early works, anyhow. So I'll give him another chance... someday.But this novel has really put me off Clarke, because this novel is really, really bad.There are about a million little criticisms I could make of this book, but I'll only list the major ones:Lack of Content: This book is a little less than 230 pages long, and yet Clarke struggles to spread the material thin enough to even make it that long. There's just very little of interest here. Clarke has ideas, but he doesn't seem to be able to explore them in any depth. This book reads like a barely fleshed-out outline of what should have been included in the novel at a later date. The lack of any meaningful content is particularly noticeable in the SLLLLLLLLLLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOWWWWW middle segment. This novel is boring and lacks significant speculation.Horrible character development: I know Clarke isn't well-known for his memorable characters, but these people are hardly distinguishable from one-another. And no, the epic scope of the novel doesn't justify this. These people aren't people: they're interchangeable sock puppets.Bad concepts: Apparently, evolution doesn't mean to Clarke what it means to biologists. Rather, to him, evolution is this vague ladder up the Great Chain of Being. The Overlords despair at being unable to evolve any further. WHY IS THIS A PROBLEM? They've adapted perfectly to their native environment. And even if they could evolve further, this doesn't mean they'd improve in some abstract way as a species. Clarke's evolution seems to be indistinguishable from the Nazi conception of it, wherein it'll create a breed of supermen. This is NOT how evolution works, Mr. Clarke. And besides, is there even a mechanism for it?As if this wasn't bad enough, Clarke apparently seems to think that the next step in human evolution is--get this--toward collectivism. And I don't mean politically. The evolved human, in Clarke's view, is a heartless, soulless, glassy-eyed automaton that inevitably sheds its mortal shell and merges to become just another part of a great galactic hive mind that runs around space absorbing evolved species. Did you get that? Humanity's ultimate end is to out-borg the borg, to become an anonymous cog in a great collective machine. Charming. Clarke kills of the human race and merges the newly evolved psychic children with a relish that can only be described as revolting.Oh, and that brings me to another point: this novel is absolutely infatuated with the occult. Apparently rationalists have it all wrong: psychic phenomena isn't a hoax, it's a sign that humanity is ready to evolve and be assimilated by the Overmind (the name given to the hive mind in this novel).I had heard that Clarke sacrifices plot and character for concept, which in some cases could work out, but the ideas found in this novel can also be found in paranoid works of new-age ""spirituality"" in book-stores all over the world.So, I gave this book two stars instead of one, so I must like something about it, right? Well, the writing is, at certain points, evocative. There is a kind of haunting beauty in the end-of-the-world as told by Clarke, and the native planetary environment of the Overlords is well-described. And I did think that the explanation given for the appearance of the Overlords and its similarity to the religious depiction of demons was very clever.That is all the praise I can bestow upon this terrible novel. The bad definitely outweighs the good. The greatest mercy, I suppose, is that the reader doesn't have to suffer through too many pages. Then again, perhaps if Clarke had actually explored the concretes of his alien invasion story, Childhood's End would have ended up a better novel.Two thumbs way, way down.",0,0,0,0

R1M8NPD4SX1QJI,"Final Update: A lifetime of just 2 years.  Wow.I was somewhat impressed with Neat at first.  This little scanner filled a basic need, with several glitches and the occasional total software crash.  No big deal.  I suggested some improvements, but the software was never fixed.  Now, after owning one for just 2 years, Neat has shown why they had no interest in fixing or improving their product...The scanner software started crashing at startup.  It had done this on occasion, so I thought ""no big deal.""  When I went online to get support, I received a message that Neat no longer ""supports"" its devices and software; they just sell a monthly service.Neat got tired of working with ordinary 500% profit margins on $150 portable scanners, and decided they would also require a monthly fee.  This is where the real money is.  Sony and other companies have been coming around to the same truth.  I think they all learned it from the cell phone companies.  If you just bill a relatively small amount to a few million credit cards ($5-$50 per account, per month), you can make a fortune in return for absolutely nothing, and no one will protest because it seems like such a small amount each month.I guess some people like having all their finances and other personal information out there in the ""cloud,"" but I don't.  Besides, if you just want an online backup of your data, there are several free, secure alternatives.  I was already running Neatware with as little online interaction as possible, but I would never pay these crooks to mine my financial records!So, what I thought would be a lifetime (or at least long-term) $100 receipt scanner lasted about 2 years.  I will never buy another Neat product for as long as I live!1-Year Update: Had to drop it to 4 stars, because it is great, but it could be improved in many ways.Now, the hardware is very simple.  It's an open scanning cylinder in which the paper feeds straight through.  Because many (most?) receipts come from a ""roll"" of paper, and are sometimes folded or crinkled, they very often tend to exit the scanner and then loop back around to the feeder--causing a looping scan or a jam.  Barring that, receipts are often difficult to load.  This front-loading scanner is supposed to have a grab/preload function, but it only works about half the time.Most problems, however, are with the software.  First off, the OCR software is not great.  Receipts are often askew or printed poorly, and this accounts for some (but not all) of the problem.  There may only be one field that is incorrect on any given receipt (e.g. vendor, date, tax, total), but I am quite surprised on the unusual occasion that every field on a receipt is correct and the receipt is immediately ready to file.  Then, when you type in the correct info and go to another field, the corrections are not saved until you open another receipt or folder.  Problem is, I often correct the data and immediately drag the receipt into a folder--losing the corrections.  To keep from losing corrections, I have to click on another receipt, wait for it to load, then click back on the corrected receipt, then drag it to a folder.  This is a tedious waste of time.On the other hand, Neat is the only company that has these simple fields--which are just what I need.  This is still much easier than creating *and* filling appropriate fields in any other program.Second, and this may or may not be a problem for most folks, but we have several credit cards in our large family. Every time I scan a receipt, Neat seems to want to categorize the payment method as simply MC, Visa, Credit, or Debit.  I have created separate labels for, e.g., Visa ####, but Neat seems unable to learn this system--even though the numbers are printed on every receipt.Third, I started hitting a lot of bugs in the software after almost a year of use.  I looked up some tips on the web, and they worked for awhile, but Neat then started crashing every time I loaded it.  I eventually contacted customer support, who requested a log, and who gave me a 100% permanent fix.Since most shortfalls are in the software, it seems Neat could improve them if it really wanted to.  Problem is, with a hardware-based payment system, there is little to no motivation to improve the software.  I think all Neat really needs is some good old-fashioned competition.  There are plenty of great scanners out there, and there is some software that *can* manage receipts (e.g. Evernote), but no one else is really shooting specifically for the receipt-scanner market.  There are some companies now focusing on the smartphone-receipt-photo market, but I prefer the clean system of an actual scanner for my tax returns.Original Review: So I ordered the Fujitsu ScanSnap because of its great reviews.  It was a great little scanner, with a great range of functionality.  Only problem is, I needed a scanner for one very specific task--receipts.I have an awe-inspiring Brother scanner/copier/laser printer.  The resolution suits my needs, but what I really needed (badly) was a simple, reliable, and accurate hardware-software package for receipts.  It's so simple that it may seem corny, but Neat really does the job.I have a large family, and I've been wanting to scan all my receipts so I could claim our actual sales taxes.  Every time I want to scan a receipt, I just open the software, load the receipt, and hit scan.  The OCR is very good, and it has a certain amount of learning so it can recognize the vendor and format (tax, etc.).The scanner could be improved.  For one thing, the software shows up in Windows 8 and anti-virus programs as like 30 different programs and registry entries.  No big deal, it's just sloppy.  More importantly, if the computer has hibernated since you last used Neat, you will have to unplug and replug the scanner to get it to work.  I do it at the scanner, and I now know to do it while the software is loading.  So again, no big deal.  I also have not yet had to deal with a major software update and the reported losses of data, backward compatibility, or other problems.  But 6 months into the year and several hundred receipts into it, everything is peachy!",0,0,0,0

R2BZ02NUFDH4SH,"I only had these on my bike for a short time 2 weeks and got my first flat and the slime feature did not seal the leak at all. I also installed (Tube Protection) that is Tire Liners before installing these tough tubes and still get flats.The problem the Tires,nobody makes a thick Tire anymore. They make them like tubes. I need a tire that you can ride on gravel roads for hours a day, some dry grass with very small sharp thorns that you have trouble seeing due to there size. I am not a racer and I don`t care about the weight of the tire, I need a thick tough Tire and I can not find anyone that makes them. I just purchased a set of ""Kenda"" (K838) Tires due to the reviews I read and the fact that they ship them in a full size box. I figured if they ship them that way they must be too heavy made and thick to fold up in those small boxes that most Bicycle tire come in these days. Dam when I was a kid all tires were hung and not folded up like a tube. That is the problem for all of us that just want to get where we are going without a flat tire. Nobody makes a decent heavy made Tire these days and that is why we all keep getting flats. it is not the tubes job to protect the Tire, its the other way. The Tire needs to be made strong enough to last long and to protect the tube so we don`t get a flat just riding across a dirt field or a gravel road or even a city street has broken glass that a well made tire should be able to handle most of the time.

R157JQ4UD7VMJ5,"Author suggests that you should take responsibility for everything bad that happens in your life (for example instead of saying ""it's not my fault I'm ill"" she believes that you should accept that you're entirely responsible for falling ill); seemly ignoring that many of the hurdles life throws at people are often caused by factors outside of their control.

RRXAYT9S2X547,"Most other reviews here have pointed out the shallowness of the ideas in this novel, manifested in the hollowness of the characters, etc. All of this is true, but when it comes down to it, House Atriedes book simply  suffers from bad writing, and ultimately, I feel, bad editing. The writer  isn't always to blame. Authors sometimes get so close to their work that  glaring inconsistancies become invisible to them. It is then the job of the  editor to sort out these problems. That job has not been done well enough  in this case. While there are many examples in House Atriedes, one that  stood out was the description of a chair as ""comfortable"" in one  sentence, and ""uncomfortable"" in the next. This was no attempt at  irony, metaphor, whatever. Just bad writing. Everything else follows from  this. The poor development of character, the debasing of any mythic  resonance established in the original series (how about those Salusan bulls  - straight out of Lost in Space!), the complete lack of insight or broad  philosophical/historical ideas that made the original so exemplary. Worse  still, and perhaps somewhat disturbing, was the role of females within the  novel. When they weren't sitting around eating fruit and looking pretty,  they were being raped, blasted, or eaten in scenes that lingered a little  too long for my liking. While men in the novel suffered various noble  deaths, there seemed to be a kind of sick delight on the writers parts in  establishing and ""executing"" various cruel ends for the women.

R3UPRJZZF6E67V,"Engaging. Informative. Speculative. Illuminating. Irritating. Thoughtful. Mistaken. These terms describe  Merve Emre’s new book, The Personality Brokers (in the US) and What’s Your Type? (in Australia and Europe), published by Doubleday.  Emre brilliantly used sources in multiple places to support her historical rendering of the family environment and passions of the mother-daughter duo who are responsible for the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator® assessment.  She managed to expose a host of attitudes, reflective of the time, and of the unique character of the individuals involved.Emre’s real goal, however, is to use the popularity of the MBTI® tool to expose issues in the use of psychological tools in organizations.  She is right to point out that using personality based tools for selection and promotion is problematic and typically doesn’t end well for the individual or the organization.  Noting that individuals are being improperly evaluated from a self-report tool is precisely why the professional associations around the world have such high standards regarding the use of assessments.  What all social scientists know is that any assessment has measurement error and to make hard and fast conclusions on a single data point isn’t good science or a good use of science-based tools.Certainly, the MBTI® tool, if not the most used, among the most used “personality” related tools in the world is a prime target for attack on two levels.  Most importantly, the use of this tool (and others) tends to be far beyond the bounds of what the tool’s purpose is, how the tool was constructed, and how the tool should be deployed.  A second issue is on the nature of the tool itself and whether it stands to scrutiny.No matter how many times people are told that personality tools should not be used for hiring and promotion decisions as a single data point, companies still do it.  Their HR departments want a quick fix and as with most quick fixes, it is a very poor band-aid to a very complex problem.  Regrettably, training and educating others on the proper use of tools is never a one and done proposition.  Publishers need to be relentless in providing guidance regarding the use of the tools they publish.Emre’s main purpose to call out the abuse of individuals through the use of psychological tools is a five-star theme.  The evidence she pulls together to show the passion and obsession of the Briggs and Myers development of the assessment is also compelling.  Emre has done a service to anyone interested in both the context and the detail related to the development of a tool, and in this case, the MBTI.  While much of this history I knew, Emre filled in some blank spots which are consistent with the family lore that has been shared.I agree with Emre’s supposition that “the labeling of live human beings emerged as one technique for annihilating individuality” (p. XVI).  There isn’t much doubt that many people experience their results as described. In fact, Jung wrote in many of his letters that type was not to be used for this purpose; rather, the theory of type was to alert individuals to a way to start a journey of understanding personal paths to individual uniqueness.  This distortion Emre noted isn’t the fault of the tool; rather, it is the problem of the user who either doesn’t understand the tool or have a clear understanding of the underlying theory.  As I wrote in I’m Not Crazy, I’m Just Not You, individuals should never trade self-knowledge for personal power and personal uniqueness…..as the poet said,  we should avoid “knowledge gained with a loss of power.”  I think there is abundant anecdotal evidence that the MBTI has been used incorrectly and used far beyond its purposes and the parameters of its statistical limits.  But this claim can be made of almost any self-report tool that corporations use for selection.  This issue is very important and very complex.As a side note, I suggest any form of labeling—race, gender, any orientation label—has the potential to limit self-understanding and personal growth.  The claims that Emre makes apply to almost every system in the social sciences.  Unlike these other systems, psychological type assumes that gaining clarity about your natural tendencies is just a starting point.  The goal is to understand the whole system and your use of it.  There is no doubt that lots of experts have Procrustean beds which they like to put people in; psychological type, the basis of the MBTI tool, proposes it is an expansive and complex system we can access and use to enrich life choices and individual growth.Emre’s discussion of the state of training on the MBTI® tool is appalling.  I checked in with a few people who recently were trained in the tool and their account was not too far off Emre’s descriptions of how the material was presented and the spirit that permeated certification.  For those of us who know psychological type, have trained and been trained regarding the MBTI® decades ago, we can only lament that the rigor and principles of care that once guided such training has apparently been lost.  For example, strictly speaking, the MBTI® assessment is not a personality assessment.  It was designed to get at a framework Carl Jung proposed that affects our mindsets.  Rather than personality, Jung was interested in how we use our mental processes for seeing and acting on things.  He never thought of these as “fixed” traits and was interested in showing how processes affect attitudes and choices. This was never thought of as “fixed” and invariant; it is a fluid system that has a home base. Emre’s own historical account of Myers initial reports shows that she understood Jung’s model and that it was full of sources of variation.  But this is apparently no longer part of the training conversation.  In addition, training used to have a rigorous approach to reviewing the statistical methods for estimating reliability and validity of assessment tools, especially as applied to the MBTI® assessment, which is also lost.Emre’s commitment to fair-mindedness does not extend to looking at all of the evidence about the science related to the MBTI® tool, and by extension, all other tools measuring for psychological type.  For example, rather than reporting that there are science-minded critics on all sides of the fence about the reliability and validity of the MBTI (and other tools), she declares “it is a well-known fact that the type indicator is not scientifically valid” (p.xv)  This would come as a major surprise to the hundreds of graduate committees who approved the tool for use in dissertations or the multiple studies done to show how type preferences are demonstrated.And Emre falls prey to the same limited criticism that so many do by relying on the 1985 manual of the MBTI rather than looking at the newest edition of the manual which describes an entirely new statistical method for re-creating the tool.  In short, you would be hard pressed to find social scientists declaring that an item response analysis based on a random sampling of the US population is useless and discredited.  Item response analysis is very complex and technical; suffice it to say that many consider it among the most powerful methods available for measurement of human behavior.  Through the seemingly endless articles criticizing the MBTI® I have yet to see a critic take up the analysis that is the basis of the newest version of the tool, the research for which was completed 20 years ago.All psychological tools have problems and issues, which is why methods for looking at the reliability and validity of a tool result in “estimations” rather than definitive declarations of what is or isn’t worthwhile.  The evidence speaks for itself.  And truthfully, we should expect more evidence and demand higher research standards for assessment tools in general.Psychological type is a model attempting to get individuals to think about how their minds work.  What are our tendencies for managing our energy?  Our tendencies for an approach to information?  Strategies for making decisions?  Typical approaches to daily life?  These are worthwhile questions if we want to learn more about managing stress and renewal, understanding differences in approaches, and being open to multiple paths to get to right answers.  That this nuanced, rich framework has been lost in the training and lost in the application of psychological type assessments is lamentable.On the whole, Emre’s book (whatever title is being applied) reveals problems and issues with the use of assessments and the pernicious effects of tools used inappropriately.  She exposes that there is a good deal of money in the assessment world and it has vested interests.  All those issues are important and call upon serious-minded social scientists and users of tools to be mindful.  Erme deftly identifies threads of fascism and sexism that run through the historical context.  Unfortunately, she conflates application with intention, popularity with greed, and bias with evidence.  For example, she confuses how the MBTI is used with what Myers and Briggs intended, or even current guidance in the Manual about the use of the tool.The supposition that Katharine Briggs and Isabel Myers were the “first to perceive how hungry the masses were for simple, self-affirming answers to the problem of self-knowledge” (p.XVII)” implies an intention which is revisionist history.  Looking back on how things emerged in the history of the use of the tool, it seems true to me that many individuals were captivated by the patterns suggested by the MBTI® results.  To suggest that Briggs and Myers planned to make the MBTI an engine of wealth betrays every letter or reported conversation they had about their interest in type.  They believed that type could help solve a lot of personal problems and they believed that type provided a constructive way to understand human differences.  These intentions are a far cry from attempting to leverage the MBTI® as a source of wealth.Here are a few of her declarations which mar the impact of the work. Erme shows a picture of Katharine (mother) and Isabel (daughter at 5 years old) and declares “Katharine and Isabel look straight into the camera: Katharine with pride; Isabel with docility and incomprehension” (p.11)  I covered the description and shared the picture with 10 women and 10 men in ages from 18-74.  When I asked what they saw in the image, people used terms like focused, intention, warm, affectionate, pleasant, and a host of other terms.  Not one person said that they saw pride and incomprehension, and certainly, that was not my reaction.  There are a hundred different ways to describe that image but to impose “incomprehension” on someone’s look is quite remarkable and suggests a bias about the person as an adult, which is later confirmed in the narrative.Reliance on a single critic (e.g. Stricker, p. 216ff) of any topic indicates a lack of thoroughness.  At the same time that Stricker was launching his opinion of an early version of the MBTI, ETS statistician David Saunders had completed an additional analysis which countered Stricker’s views.  Yet, Saunders isn’t noted nor his youthful (like Stricker) and later wise (in his 60s) analysis of additional data provided by Organizational Renewal Associates which was the basis for what has become Step II.  None of these are “hidden” facts or characters in the story but notably absent here.  This history would argue against the narrative of an awful tool, born of greed, and useless to society.Emre writes, “Beyond all the pseudoscientific talk of ‘indicators’ and ‘instruments’ was a simple but subtle truth: the questionnaire reflected whatever version of yourself you wanted it to reflect, whether consciously or unconsciously” (p. 263).  If you remove the word “pseudoscientific” you have a direct statement that is true of all self-report assessments of any ilk.  Anytime a person is answering questions about how they believe they are, you are getting a picture of their own self-image as they believe it to be.  In the hands of a skilled coach or therapist, that image can be useful and a source of productive exploration.  The use of the word “pseudoscientific” is intended to suggest something of no value and represents a judgement not based on evidence.  When we say something is scientific or pseudoscience, we owe it to the reader and subject matter to explain what we mean.  Were the rules of analysis violated?  Were there no efforts to show substance?  Was any effort made to collect data and provide propositions? The reader has a right to know that there were plenty of studies done using the MBTI® tool, some of which are clarifying and others confounding about the tool and the underlying model—-which is a truthful statement about the evidence.The ending of the book is interesting in quoting Mary McCauley, the late president of CAPT and the primary aid to Myers and the MBTI for 30 years.  Mary is quoted as saying the goal is one of becoming “a more perfect type” echoing the words of Jung.  This is rather astonishing given that I knew Mary McCauley from 1980 to her death.  We had endless conversations on the potential elements of type development and what they meant.  I heard her speak of data and patterns related to type development and effective use of one’s type lens.  Not one time did I ever hear her utter the idea of a “perfect type” and I do not recall a single line in all of Jung’s work that suggests anything like that (p.269).  Jung’s notion of individuation is about embracing and growing your unique personhood and saying “yes” to what you can become.  He wrote,“Everything good is costly, and the development of personality is one of the most costly of all things.  It is a matter of saying yea to oneself, of taking oneself as the most serious of tasks, of being conscious of everything one does, and keeping it constantly before one’s eyes in all it dubious aspects—truly a task that taxes us to the utmost.”  (Jung, The Collected Works of C.G. Jung, Vol. 13, para. 24)This is a far cry from declaring people should ‘perfect’ their type or even their personality.  Myers wrote that type development is being clear about your patterns and knowing when to stretch to use other mental resources. These are calls to be uniquely human.To be fair, you should know that the primary source of my comments in this essay comes from many years of involvement with psychological type.  I was involved early in the development of the Association for Psychological Type and was among the initial professionals who were part of the development of qualifying training for users of the MBTI® from 1981 to 2008.  I served on the MBTI Research Board and participated in the research of the newest version of the MBTI® tool, along with a panel of additional Ph.D. psychologists and psychometric specialists.  I completed research on the MBTI using the data at the Center for Creative Leadership in which I analyzed the MBTI types and 75 independent variables, most of which verified predicted type patterns. I have developed my own tool for measurement of psychological type (Pearman Personality Integrator) so I know the limitations and challenges of creating a valid and reliable tool.  Further, I knew a number of the individuals profiled in the book, The Personality Brokers.  I have been an eyewitness to the growth and development of personality tools, including the MBTI®, and have researched and written about these tools.",0,0,0,0

R3IILJ8NADBV7B,"This is a great concept and mostly works as described. It's not perfect for me for two reasons. First, it will not suction to our bathroom wall. I assume that's because the wall isn't entirely smooth and, in fairness to Elmer's, the package says in small print this item may fall if attached to an uneven surface (it won't suction at all on our wall).  Second, it would be more useful if the cup was a little deeper.  My goal was to reduce bathroom countertop clutter, and I had planned on using this holder for 3 tubes of creams that are part of my teen son's acne regimen in order to get them off the counter, but still leave them in plain view (because if stored in a cabinet he won't think use them). Two tubes fit but the third is rounded and won't fit, so there's no point using it for that purpose. But what does work well is that this attaches firmly to the mirrored medicine cabinet and holds my son's toothbrush and toothpaste perfectly, so it's functional as it gets those items off the countertop. And I really appreciate that the plastic cup as well as the suction portion remove easily for washing. It's an okay product with a variety of possible uses- though it would be more practical and helpful if it was just a little deeper. I give it 3 stars.Update: I've knocked a star off because this gizmo ultimately wasn't functional enough to bother with it. The toothbrush holder idea I had wasn't as good as I thought as it gets scummy too fast, and I was constantly washing it. For holding pencils or pens, there is nowhere to adhere it to so that it was actually helpful. I put it away and it will end up in the recycle bin eventually.",0,0,0,0

Our animals all weigh 100-110 pounds and were in perfect health when we applied the solution exactly per the instructions included.We have been completely disappointed in that we have not seen ANY decrease in the amount of fleas still present on our pets.

RBUSQRD6N4E83,"What this movie had in action it lacked in heart.This is the first time I have ever been disappointed by a Pixar film.I tend to write to what emotions were evoked or what about the film I enjoyed rather than plot points so I will primarily stick to the same here with some interjections regarding theme.This was mostly a ""spy"" movie.  Great animation, excellent voice acting all of the technical wonders that Pixar can bring to the screen.The plot was decent, but a little advanced for most kids 8 or under.Guns...lots of guns.  Yeah, I know that they are not people, but kids get the inference.  ""Things"" get shot, in that they are animated and infused with persona, ""things"" die.  Not suitable for a G-rated film.  Not suitable for my child.Lastly and most important-where was the heart and soul present in all other Pixar films?!  There was kind of a broad message about staying true to yourself and your friends, but this was tucked away with jokes from Mater (Larry the Cable guy) and an almost absent Lightning McQueen who is not the protagonist of this film.I came away heartbroken.  My just seven-year old son said it best; when asked which one he liked best ""Cars"" or ""Cars 2"" he noted ""Cars 2"" because it had so much more action.  Of course he did.  He does not usually get to see guns blazing or perpetual motion in his movies.I give this movie a 2-star rating based on some great animation and use of technology with a decent story, but take away so much for missing what Pixar has always provided-A message, a real story and true heart.",0,0,0,0

R1TDEW7L7OC2TE,"I’m getting suspicious of all these Amazon products with “paid reviews”.Here’s a non-paid review. I decided to bite and try the product. Only cause I needed just ONE of these things (versus buying in bulk) and bought based on price.The product is made of extremely thin and cheap plastic. This thing can hold one sheet of paper, max.Because of the thinness of the plastic, it’s not surprising that a high probability of these came broken (for proof, read other reviews). Mine came broken.This thing feels like it was made for 5 cents (if that) and is being sold for $6.62 (at the time I bought it). That’s a HUGE return on such a cheap product.Conclusion? If you just need one like I did, better to go to your in-person box store and just buy one. Sure, you’ll pay about $3 more, but the plastic quality will be better, and you can guarantee yourself you won’t get a broken one.I guess this is part of a new business strategy where you mass produce a cheap product, give some away free to get a bunch of positive reviews to get the internet version of “shelf space” — i.e. higher placement in search rankings, and based off that placement, hook enough people to buy your product to make it worth your while. It’s like infomercials.Based on this experience, I would trust products that DIDN’T have paid reviews. Buyer beware.Addendums:- About the positive paid reviews: I’m sure if you got something for FREE (no risk to you at all), of course you would be nice about it. And I’m sure they made SURE the reviewers didn’t get broken products. I’m sure it cost them barely anything to give away free 5 cent products to buy people’s time to improve search page rankings.- I would be more forgiving if this product was half the price (being generous). I would be even more patient if it was a dollar. Then I could say, “Well, you get what you paid for”. But this product is EXTREMELY OVERPRICED FOR THE QUALITY.Last addendum: As I'm writing this review, the price has jumped up to $13 for ONE?? TOTAL RIPOFF. DO NOT BUY.",3,1,0,1

However, it does not activate with UPS Worldship and allow you to place your package on it to be weighed and then transfer that weight automatically into Worldship.

I was constantly needing to replace the ink cartridges on this printer, and they are not cheap!* Does not have a good ""low power"" mode. When it goes to sleep it doesn't wake up from a wireless print job.* Does not print black when color cartridges are out of ink.* Design is just bad.

RH9YBS5VKM8KL,"There is this joke about a bloke driving on the highway who listens to a wrong-way driver announcement on the radio. Hearing this, the bloke yells: ""One? There are thousands!"".Without doubt the idea behind the Spin is novel, well designed and awe-inspiring. Umfortunately, the effort to embed this idea into human drama has failed spectacularly (at last for me), both because of the dismal storytelling as well as the clumsy handling of the personell.Instead of being filled with wonder (which the idea behind the Spin would allow), I had the impression that SPIN was written by a ten year old boy, who has a good overview of currently discussed science and technology but has no grasp on language, no idea of a narrative development and does not yet has had first hand experience on how the world actually works and adult people interact (in society, business and romance). Nevertheless, the boy sits down and writes a 450 page novel followed by another two.You can see my problem ? Experience has taught me that as soon as I find myself holding a minority opinion it is advisable to re-check my assumptions. So, most likely it is me who rides on the wrong side. Especially, since SPIN appears to have received a Hugo Award.Well, I have reread spin twice now, but whilst the Spin-aspects seem more and more impeccable, the parts related to human interaction, religion and governance to me are still inconsumable and appear ever more pointless. Could it be that a HUGO is based on the idea behind a story only and does not take into account any literary aspects ?Minor SPOILER:The view of the author on mankinds' ability to survive as a civilisation seems to be bleaker than the one from Iain M. Banks. The latter seems to think that without external interference the survival rate of civilisations is rather small, whilst Robert C. Wilson rates it simply at zero.

R1I8CQWF5KGGYA,"I give such a low rating merely because it was simply unusuable. I bought a copper and blue bowl because I thought they were pretty and they were dishwasher safe. First of all, they do not look as they do in the photo; the outside is a darker, duller color, and has a rough texture to it, not like the bright shiny appearance in the photo. I popped the bowls in the dishwasher once I got them and when they came out, the ink from the paw print design was smeared everywhere, ruining the bowl and getting all over my hands. Clearly, I was not about to give this to my puppy. I was extremely disappointed and returned both bowls, claiming them defective.",0,0,0,0

I didn't even attempt that, because I knew once I broke it, it would leave a rough edge. I was going to use these in our home classroom, but for sure couldn't do that with rough edges. In the drawer or not, I didn't want to risk rough metal edges. Also, I am not sure how sturdy the plastic pieces would be that were holding it together. They seemed rather flimsy when I took them out of the box. Also, as others have posted, I am not sure that these would work with legal size folders, they middle support piece didn't seem long enough.

I just tapped it down and that was it, 4 bits of metal came off and the spring and it no longer works.This product works veery well and extremely sturdy. The only drawback I can think of is that the screws are visible. If  it had come with  a cover then this item would be more aesthetically pleasing. It came with screws that has the drill bit on the end to drill through metal/wood so you don't need a drill to install this. It works very well and  you can easily operate it with no hands. It is just attached to a spring so when you step on it, it will draw up the kick stand. I would definitely purchase this again if I need a kick stand doorstop.

Not this one. I moved from the city to the country and I'm uninterested introducing my son to unwarranted stereotypes about country living... ones that are far afield enough that he wouldn't pick them up locally. The only events on the calender in the country are chili dinner fundraisers? Old houses leak inside? There is no place to take your raked leaves? Bunnies get big bellies from eating natural foods in the garden? I agree the campy pictures and the way Lane Smith writes are clever and interesting, but in spite of the overall message that it's important to let frustrating things in life roll off your back I wish the author had done so without giving the impression families need to change their perspective if they dare move to the country. That same find-a-happy-perspective could have been made without also taking cheap shots. I am publishing this review so that would-be-buyers realize the book isn't just fun.

R8T0QTYVAFY6U,"The printer seems to be fair to good quality. Had a Lexmark 7675 before this and it worked well and was an easy installation. This thing however is not the case. Hooked up easy by usb but wont connect wireless. Same router and hook up as my old one and nothing. Keep getting an error report that says I have to much signal. Now for the REAL DOWNFALL of purchasing a Lexmark printer. LEXMARK TECHNICAL SUPPORT, dont waste your time,and even more concerning to me is after I called them, they ignored and wouldnt even discuss the error I was telling them was showing up. I talked to two different technicians and they both wanted me to let them remote control my computer from their end. Oh ya by the way. one was in India , who I had to quit talking to because I could not understand anything he was saying, and the other was in the Phillipines. I highly recomend you do not trust them on your computer. Neither one of them solved anything with my printer. The person in the Phillipines kept telling me he was waiting to get on while the window on my screen told me he was on my computer, and working. Then he requested me to let him on my desktop office computer, and I told him no, I was getting very suspicious by this time. I would basically say that Lexmark has NO technical support.

RT915CGSJXRTY,"I regret ever purchasing this thing!  Where to start...I've had this printer for over a year now and it has been underwhelming from the start.I purchased this for my home office.PROS: The only redeeming quality of this printer is that I can feed multiple pages to scan or fax.  But that feature only goes but so far.CONS: Print quality is a joke.  Every single page I've printed has streaks, despite multiple cleanings, ink cartridge changes, etc.If you're printing docs with just black text you MIGHT be ok, but anything else, forget about it.The monthly fee for ink that seemed like a great economical option is awful.  You get charged for every page, but thanks to a bug it would print things that you cancelled out of the queue as well as the stuff you did want.  If you don't have internet you can't print.  Customer service while not the worst I've encountered, seem unable to fix the poor print quality issues I've had since I've received the thing.I know it's easy to gloss over a bad review especially when you see other good ones, but I promise you, save your dollars and your sanity, get another printer.",0,0,0,0

It's clearly displayed in the upper right hand corner of the box on the Amazon listing. When I received them, while everything else looked the same, the print in the upper right displayed that they only hold up to 1 pound, not 2. That's quite a difference.At any rate, since the lightweight poster board photograph that I wanted to hang on my wall weighed a mere 8 ounces, I expected no problem using these mounting squares. I was wrong. Within a matter of days, the picture fell off of the wall and was damaged. In addition, when I removed the squares from the wall, they left behind some of the gooey adhesive, making them 100% useless for the purpose intended.The bottom line is that this is a lousy product.

But more than anything else, this book does not teach you how to think like a nurse. All of the practice tests and questions are knowledge based--there's little to no emphasis or time spent explaining how to think or reason through questions. Hogan just crams a ridiculous amount of information into the book, places a little ""NCLEX"" stamp next to literally almost every piece of information (what's even the point, then?) and then expects you to memorize ALL of it. The questions are designed that way, too--you either know the answer of you don't--there's almost zero opportunity to reason through a question like you will need to on the real NCLEX. And somehow she manages to create obscure questions that test on information that wasn't even covered in the materials.

R3YP579H99GY7,"I loved this movie as a kid but hadn't watched in twenty five years. As a lover of Science Fiction and Fantasy I had to give this movie another look. For me it's one of those movies that got lost under Star Wars, Enemy Mine, Alien, Aliens and Krull over the years when it came to favorites. I can honestly say the critics at the time who panned this film were almost completely correct.Many things I didn't notice as a kid, stuck out like a sore thumb as an adult. The romance is limited at best - very poorly done, the effects are horrible even for its time, there are many plot holes, the music is horrible, it lacks attention to detail, the battles lack appeal - along with scope and most of the acting is not good. Apart from Patrick Stuart and Kyle MacLachlan.Despite that there are moments of brilliance and with a sea of Hollywood remakes that usually make no sense - this is the one that should get a remake. The novels themselves are among the best Science Fiction ever written and though the Sci Fi channel (at the time) did their best to remake it - a modern remake would be amazing. Considering how Dune was a flop at the time though, I do not think studios would take the risk but I hope they do. Who knows if Science Fiction ever takes off in the mainstream like Fantasy ending up doing this may get another shot.The novels are amazing - true masterpieces and I think that is why many people defend this movie as a classic. It really isn't and not even close when you stop to think about other Science Fiction of the time period it seems even worse. Read the novels for the full Dune experience nothing else is worth of the novels currently.Pros- Kyle MacLachlan- Patrick Stuart- Gets some of the source material rightCons- Bad effects (even for it's time)- Bad acting throughout the other cast - especially Sting- Bad music- Plot holes- Lack of romance and lack of chemistryConclusionMany older Science Fiction fans like myself with argue with you all day how this is classic Science Fiction at it's best. While I love the novels, this is far from a classic - unless you consider it a classic bad movie. Nostalgia used to be considered a mental illness and this is one of the times people should be able to see why. Fond memories tend to fade flaws overtime and they are slowly replaced with more fabricated great ones.While there are examples of something being as good as you remembered, (Princess Bride, Aliens, Predator) this isn't one such movie of the genre.

R7TU2RNWBZC6O,"I bought this cleaner in 2000, and it worked okay for the first few years.  I was VERY disappointed that it only worked for 5 minutes and then had to be recharged.  For spot cleaning, it worked fine, but for serious stains (mud and wine), it did not work as well as I thought it would.  Also, the holding tank would leak, even when I made sure to tighten it.  A few months ago, when I would plug it in for recharging, the red ""charge"" light would flicker, or not even come on.  I ended up throwing it all away about a month ago.  Not bad for $30, and almost 5 years of heavy use, but I give it only two stars because of the small amount of time it can work and that it didn't clean some stains.",0,0,0,0

R5FCLGC453VZ1,"If the improbable, romantic history of Christianity in China doesn't convince you that ""truth can be stranger than fiction,"" what can?  Last year I visited the lovely stone pagoda outside of Xian, what remains of the oldest Christian complex in China, where an ancient stone telling the story of the first Christians was found four hundred years ago.  Poetic Chinese Nestorian texts blending Buddhism and Christianity were later discovered in caves hundreds of miles towards Afghanistan along the Silk Road.  After the long hike to China, the participants in this early meeting of East and West deserve two things: a thoughtful and informed introduction, and the chance to speak for themselves.Riegert and Moore provide the latter, but not the former.  The second half of this book consists mostly of exerpts from the various discovered texts.  These are fascinating and often beautiful; sometimes leaning towards Gospel, sometimes towards dharma, at times agreeing with both, occasionally with neither.  I have a copy of the Nestorian scroll; difficult Chinese, for me at least, but the translation here seems fairly plausible.  While it might be too much to hope for a copy of the original in this popular treatment, I wish they had at least said where they obtained their tranlations.  They are quite different from those in Palmer and another available on-line, but no explanation is given of where they came from.The texts are fascinating, poetic, and often beautiful.  By contrast, Riegert and Moore might have written the introductions in a couple afternoons, and drummed up the research for them in a few days.  It is not clear that the authors knew a lot about China, or Nestorian Christianity(making them sound like members of the Jesus Seminar), though it is obvious they were fond of Buddhism.One of the book's key errors appears culpable.  The authors claim to be offering ""1300 year old scrolls"" from China.  No hint is dropped that the texts they offer might differ in character.  But in fact, the Nestorian stone is 1250 years old; the scrolls are more recent.  (According to Palmer.  The authors do not argue with him; they just fudge the distinction between the stone and the scrolls.  As I recall, Samuel Moffett, whom the authors quote, also points out that the stone reveals a more orthodox Christianity than later scrolls.)  The authors are either simplistic, or disingenuous, to confuse later syncretism with the first Chinese Christian text, which appear pretty orthodox.While I think his enthusiasm for karma and other dubious ideas is naive (see my review in Books and Culture), Martin Palmer's The Jesus Sutras is a better and more interesting book.  (Perhaps because it was written for love, while I rather suspect this short, artsy little volume of having been written for money.) There is room for more books on the subject, but I hope the next person who takes it on will approach the interchange of syncretism, dharma, and Gospel, with deeper and more critical thought.author, True Son of Heaven: How Jesus fulfils the Chinese Culture",0,0,0,0

R17Z3MCBA01Z9A,"The jacket copy for Holding Fast, by Karen James, tells the reader that this is ""a real-life journey of adventure, tragedy, love, and loss on the summit of Mount Hood."" Tragedy occurred in December 2006 when Kelly James (late husband of the author) and two other climbers were trapped on Mount Hood near Portland, Oregon. After it was discovered that the men were missing somewhere near the summit, family members and friends waited and prayed helplessly as storms pounded the mountain with hurricane-force winds so that rescue workers were unable to search for the victims. When the storms finally relented, rescue workers recovered the body of James from a snow cave near the summit. His companions' bodies have never been recovered.Now, two years later, James's widow, Karen, shares the ""untold story of the Mount Hood tragedy."" The book also recounts Kelly's past: the challenges of a difficult childhood with an abusive father and then stepfather; the love story that evolved between Kelly and Karen; and Kelly's relationship with his four children from a previous marriage.Most of the book is devoted to the events surrounding the climbing trip that took Kelly and his two climbing friends' lives. When Kelly and his two companions missed their pickup time at the base of Mount Hood on Sunday, December 10, 2006, Karen received the call she feared the most. Sheriff Joseph Wampler of Hood River, Oregon, called to make sure that Karen hadn't heard something from Kelly before he and his crew launched a search party for the three men.That Sunday evening, Karen and the children succeeded in getting a call through to Kelly's cell phone, getting what information they could about where he was holed up in a snow cave near the summit. This was to be their heartbreaking last conversation, as Kelly told his sons his location and reported that the other climbers had gone down the mountain to get help. He told them that the only food he had was half an orange. And he and Karen spoke briefly, saying ""I love you"" one last time. It was obvious that Kelly was in bad shape, and the situation was serious.Karen and other family members and friends flew to Oregon to await the results of the rescue attempts, to be there when Kelly was rescued from the mountain. Anxiety turned to frustration to despair as the weather conditions prevented search and rescue teams from locating Kelly and the other climbers, who, unknown to Kelly, had not made it down the mountain.Throughout the account, Karen comments on the faith that provided comfort to her during this ordeal:""When your world falls out from underneath you and you are on your knees, there is nowhere to look but up. Suddenly everything you have claimed about your God and your faith is put to the test. During such a time, you learn where you stand with your Maker, and the most significant question of your life slaps you right in the face: Do you really believe?""Of course the sad ending to the story is that once the storms relented, it was too late for rescue. Kelly and his friends were dead. Probably the most interesting part of the book for me was when Karen and others pieced together the clues left behind-- the possessions Kelly left in the snow cave, pictures on Kelly's camera, sent and received calls recorded on Kelly's cell phone, and tracks in the snow--to come to some conclusions about what went so terribly wrong on the mountain that weekend.I think the greatest weakness of this book is that it is unclear what its purpose is. It promises to tell the untold story of what happened on Mount Hood, and it does. It's a gripping, heartbreaking story--three men in the prime of life, experienced mountain climbers--heading out for a weekend adventure that took a tragic turn that no one could have foreseen. It's a unique story, definitely one worth telling.Yet the extended portions of the book that deal, in great detail, with Kelly and Karen's life before the tragedy and her grief responses after Kelly's death are not necessarily a story worth telling. Karen's descriptions of her husband indicate that he was a loving husband and father with a lot of personality--one of those warm charismatic people that everyone likes. Yet what makes him unique, sadly enough, is his death. Without that, no one would be writing books about Kelly James or Karen and Kelly's love story. While these things were incredibly meaningful and significant to them (as all of our loved ones and our own love stories are to each one of us), their story beyond the Mount Hood incident is not necessarily book worthy.And this is often the weakness of many books that deal with personal tragedy and grief. While each one of us in this life will experience the profundity of the loss of someone that we love very much, it obviously isn't by any stretch of the imagination a unique experience. As someone who has lost both a sister who died at age 20 and a husband at age 35, I would never suggest that such losses are not deeply significant; in fact, such losses change the person who is left behind to put the pieces back together in huge ways. It is rare to find a book that deals with circumstances like these in a meaningful way, and my managing editor and I frequently discuss what quality there is that makes the difference. And we haven't found the answer. We just know that authors like Joni Eareckson Tada and, in my opinion, Lisa Beamer, author of Let's Roll, have managed to achieve something that most writers, including Karen James, have not. Some writers successfully find that path between personal loss and the Big Picture, but most do not.A small, but annoying thing that happened throughout the book was the author's recounting of the use of what many would think of as inappropriate language or mild profanity. For example, she tells us that one holiday (Valentine's Day maybe?) after Kelly's death she knew in advance would be a ""h--- of a night."" I'm not a prude about language, but I'd like to think a good editor would either encourage the author to find a better way to express herself or just have the guts to tell us it was going to be a ""hell of a night."" Why the consonant/dash when most of us know what word is being left out? If you're going to force the reader to think it, you might as well just say it.This was my second opportunity, as one of Thomas Nelson's bloggers, to review one of their books at their expense. I have to say that this is a creative program for publicity for Nelson's new releases, and I think it's a great way to get the word out about new releases. Time constraints may take me away from Nelson books for awhile, but we'll see what other options for book reviews arise. It's hard to turn down a free book.",0,0,0,0

RB3AJ98PQL31H,"After being an Amazon customer for 10 years and hundreds of orders later, this was my single worst experience with a product and Amazons service. After getting a new job and giving up my long time company laptop to my previous employer I needed a new laptop for travel. Having being assigned training in another state for 3 weeks and given short notice, I decided to find a laptop before I left to take with me.This machine on paper is a great buy, having a i7 processor and a dedicated graphics card all for under $800. The only downsides being minimal memory and lacking a SSD, however the ability to upgrade the RAM and the intel Optane feature helped make up for this. In fact, even with the traditional hard drive, the Optane memory gave the laptop nearly SSD like boot times. But, I was less impressed with application load times and data transfer speeds again compared with a SSD.My only real gripe however was the awful track pad. The track pad has integrated mouse buttons which requires pressing down on the bottom left and right corners of the pad. When you press down you'll first feel a slight click but the pad requires you to press down further before it actually registers. Even more frustrating was feeling the entire pad rocking up and down as you scroll around the pad and press down just a little too much. To avoid this, you have to ever so slightly press your fingers to the pad. I found this very distracting and wouldn't have been an issue with traditional buttons.I should also point out that this computer was a lot heavier and bigger than I was expecting having used other 15.6"" laptops.All of this isn't why I awarded it only one star, it was Amazons service. First off was the availability, as I stated earlier I was in a hurry. The listing had stated there was six in stock, so I selected the free prime shipping method. After waiting several days for it too ship, it turned out it wasn't in stock, and wouldn't arrive in time. So I had to cancel the order and pay for expedited shipping.Next, only one week into my three trip week the hard drive crashed to the point where Windows would not boot and I was unsuccessful recovering the system using the Dell recovery partition. Leaving me with only my smart phone for two weeks.After I returned home I had about one week left to return the computer and initiated the process. This went fine until I tried to drop it off at a UPS store. Amazon uses UPS Ground to ship returns in Alaska, which UPS cannot accept when products contain lithium batteries, they have to ship 2nd Day Air. This is only an issue in Alaska and Hawaii. Amazon support seemed completely oblivious to this despite the UPS store employees explaining to me this same problem happens all the time. After two 45 minute calls to Amazon support, the solution they came up with was providing me with a blank return label and have me ""Self Ship"" the laptop back to them. They verbally explained to me I be would reimbursed for the cost which ended up being over $120 and was told I would simply have to call support back with the cost and provide a receipt (shipping to and from Alaska is very expensive). 30 minutes after this call I had shipped the laptop off and called Amazon back... they had no idea what I was talking about despite the assurances I was given. After another 45 minutes of explaining the situation they finally agreed to review the receipt but provided me with an email address that only gave me a return message stating it doesn't accept incoming emails. Again they seemed completely oblivious to this and told me without proof they couldn't reimburse me.I did receive my money back for the cost of the laptop and the initial shipping fee but so far have been left with a $120 return shipping bill, no laptop, and a lot of frustration. After this experience I'm left with a bad taste for Amazon and will not be purchasing a laptop from them in the future.",0,0,0,0

R35IA6ZZSZ7WU4,"Some voracious reading of research on...(1) ""Network externalities"" from economics and(2) WOM (word of mouth) research from social/cognitive psychology...and shamelessly rehashing them with a doozy touchy-feely spin on ""small things can inspire big things"" a la ""Pay it Forward"" (that Helen Hunt/Kevin Spacey rigmarole) -- and lo and behold, you have a tipping point for a book that people are stomping over each other to buy and magically provoke their thinking about marketing or sociological phenomena.Indeed every once in a while we need a business book that summarizes and makes sense of all that goes on in academia, so even such blatant intellectual debauchery would be fine as long as the BASIC professional integrity of attribution was upheld. The very least one can expect from such a self-proclaimed ""biography of an idea"" endeavour is an honest acknowledgement of WHERE the idea came from.As though it was not embarrassing enough that epithets like ""maven"" and ""connector"" are well established in WOM or network externality research since nearly 20 years, we were also fed with the MOST commonly used illustrations -- faxes becoming important because other people had faxes, or some quaint fashion catching up overnight (Hush Puppies in this case, but it could be any number of things), or how broadband has swept our world, or the success of a TV show -- these are all primetime textbook examples to explain the very fundamental concepts of network externality in ECON 101. Some arcane mention of epidemiologists' theories does not count because the whole hypothesis here is to provide something that is ""beyond the world of medicine and diseases"". Not one mention of the ""Network Externality"" in the book or in the glossary at the end.To its minor credit, the book is written with a readable flow although expect to have each and every minutiae explained in a ""for dummies"" style. For e.g., the perfectly simple notion that yawning is visually and aurally contagious is explained over 2 pages of relatively small print with about 100 mentions of the word yawn. Yawn. Such excruciating fleshing out of material is understandable of course, given how little of substance there really was in this ""thinking"" to begin with.The text wallows in its conflicting logical morass. Remember, ""small things"" are supposed to make a big difference. A winding 40 pages are devoted to crime combat in NY under a newly appointed police chief. Forgive me if this concerted annual effort by a legitimate full-fledged police force does NOT sound like a ""small thing"" to me.We are told ""What must underlie successful epidemics is a bedrock belief that change is possible"". Unfortunately, all the examples Gladwell cites such as a sweeping shoe vogue, faxes becoming popular -- these are all a matter of happenstance instead of a concerted effort by individuals at a point in time. Such is indeed the true nature of contagious phenomenons as he himself mentions at the outset, there is no ""bedrock belief"" until afterwards when someone sits and analyzes the event. I could also hypothesize that a lot of these mini-revolutions happen when an optimal chain of events is accidentally (unintentionally) spurred on by some triggers in society/environment etc, but that is for another day.As though this were not enough we are treated to semi-pompous implications. For e.g., page 131: ""There is something PROFOUNDLY counter-intuitive in the definition of stickiness that emerges from all these examples"". Really? Would have been nice if it were apparent instead of having us hit on the head with it.Come to think of it a ""big effect"" is a pretty flaky/subjective concept anyway. How could this supposed big effect be sustained? Where are hush puppies now? As for NY's crime rate, many experts such as Andrew Karmen from CUNY (John Jay) believe that the drop in crime rates in NY in 1980s or 90s is insignificant, homicides in the city have risen 10-fold since 1950. How about faxes -- and their big effect being eaten by another big effect (email)?What is most piquing though is that in a round-about way we are offered Polyanna solutions as a result of this 3-pronged theory of network externality. One priceless gem emerges when we are convinced how cleaning a subway system would be enough to solve crime rates (with the Bernie Goetz case as a lynchpin). My retorts won't fit this review.Whether this is a legitimate business book or a mere avante-garde coffee table thoughtpiece, one would have at the least expected some sort of an organized framework to plan for these ""small things"" or to sustain the ""big effects"". None is forthcoming. As for me, the very fact that well-established research is packaged here in a 250-page drawl as a pretentiously seminal idea is quite a put-off in itself. A simple 5-6 page HBR article would have done the job just fine, but then that wouldn't make a lot of money for Gladwell, would it.If you are in business and hope to use this stuff for a spiral marketing/branding effort, you'd do a lot better getting your hands on some WOM literature than this inchoate theoretical indulgence.Highly over-rated material, this.",0,0,0,0

R11KL55KWY8XNK,"I saw some of the negative reviews for this sharpener, but decided to try it out anyway and hope for the best. That was a waste of time. I tried it out as soon as I got it. Everything seemed to work ok (not great, but ok), except for the fact that it would sharpen and then immediately break the entire tip EVERY SINGLE pencil/colored pencil I tried to sharpen. At first I thought the initial pencil I tried to sharpen just had really broken up lead inside, but after trying it on multiple pencils I realized it was the doing of the sharpener. Other than that, I really disliked that it was just one of your typical hand held pencil sharpeners attached to a motor. I didn't think about it before purchasing, but after trying to use it, all of those broken pencil tips had to be removed by hand. In other words, after each attempt I had to open it up and use a toothpick to push the broken tip back out. SO annoying!!! Do yourself a favor and buy something different.",0,0,0,0
R2EVDU86WR9F8A,"Perhaps like others, I chose to read this book because I was curious to know more about Franzen's background, first because he seems to be both in trouble with and/or adored by the public these days (for example: I read a Slate interview a few days ago, which prompted me to read this book, and when I googled him again yesterday, he was getting excoriated for the things he said during his interview). I also enjoy his fiction and essays and believed that I would enjoy reading this memoir, if only to hear a kindred, tortured soul speak of growing up in the Midwest.What we learn: Franzen loves birds and finds it grounding and perhaps too much of an obsession, and that it disturbs him greatly that humans are destroying birds' habitats, he was in a church youth group that he for the most part really liked, did some school pranks, studied German, didn't get along with his parents so much but grew to love his mother near the end of her life, was enamored by Snoopy, divorced his first wife, wanted children with his second partner, now lives with his partner childless. When I finished, I wondered what I had been looking for - more of the cutting, gut-wrenching type of drama in his fiction work? There were hints of that - his brother walking out on his parents, his first marriage, his parents' disapproval of career choice, his slow realization with his second partner that there would be no children. But he plays it down quite a bit and really, takes much more time to quote German literature (Kindle version-you can't see translations), describe his school pranks in detail (the desk piling prank was hilarious), list off many different types of birds (this got a little tedious though I googled a couple of them), and give a lengthy review of the literature of Charles Schulz and what it meant to him growing up.In the end, this book doesn't really give what I had wanted - I think I was expecting some sort of epic story a la ""Wild"" by Strayed. Also, this book felt a little awkward, and gave off the impression that it was something someone else encouraged him to write for the people (like me). I suggest sticking to his fiction and essays - that's where you get the provocative ideas, autobiographical bits and pieces, and sometimes unconventional opinions, all spun with his lucid, confident prose.",0,0,0,0
R1BS6PKKUW52TA,"Let me preface this unfortunate review with my undying love and devotion to Radiohead as my favorite band ever.I'm not going to go so far as call this album ""bad"" or ""good"" because lets face it, music speaks to everyone differently.  What I will say, however, is that I am pretty disappointed with this album and I would probably rank it in quality around the same level as Pablo Honey-a very mixed rated album which I am sure this album will receive much of the same.What really sets this album apart from the others is its lack of energy.  The first track ""Bloom"" does try to bring a bit of hype like ""15-step"" does in ""In Rainbows,"" however after the first four tracks it really begins to fade away.If I had to categorize this album, I would put it in easy listening.That is not to say that it is a complete loss by any means.  ""Bloom"" is a bit overly scattered sound wise, however it is pretty catchy.  ""Codex"" is quite slow and quiet but its pretty addictive as well.  Last, ""Separator"" is probably the one song that will stick in your head more than others and to be honest, it really spoke to me.I'm not really sure what they were trying to do with ""Give up the ghost,"" but you will either love it or hate it.  The birds chirping and guitar sound almost makes it sound a bit like country which leads me to believe that this whole album was a big experiment.In the end, its nothing personal against Radiohead.  I love you guys to death, but I know what I like and what I don't like and after the awesomeness of ""In Rainbows,"" this cannot even compare.",0,0,0,0

R3D6T2PCV4SWG2,"Parachutes and A Rush Of Blood To The Head were two great albums. X&Y is probably a transition without  a clear direction. A blend of U2, Radiohead, Oasis, Beatles and sometimes Electric Light Orchestra sounds. It's not a bad album, but not one in the standard of the two previous. Again, Martin offers a very good vocal part and the instrumental parts are good too. But the compositions suffer from a lack of organisation and personality. They need to find their own sound and I'm sure it will come with the growing maturity of the band.The real problem with this album is the sound quality. It's incridible, we are in 2005 and a band like Coldplay is not enough professional to give us a recording without distortion. The sound (wanted or not), on this new album, is simply cheaper than many analog recordings done in the 60's and than remastered on cd. It's a shame that a band and a cd compagny  sell that kind of product in our digital time. Instead of using a copy control devise (and with that, insulting the real buyers of cd who like doing their own compilation for their own use), EMI should be more aware of the quality of what they sell to the people.The work on this album deserve at least 3 stars, but for the real « audiophiles » because of the bad quality sound, I give it, only 2 stars.",0,0,0,0

And I dont like how Tianna all of a sudden turned bad. I mean, there's no proof of it, but after reading this book, you kind of get an idea. I really liked her, and its a shame that she has to be the one to go bad.The only reason I gave this book 2 stars instead of 1 star is because it was interesting getting to meet Catty's dad, and Nefandus was a pretty cool place.",0,0,0,0
R20IFP4O9YTV2I,"Holy Smokes! There are more than 150 movies released in HK per year, and this one was the # 1 at the box office for the entire year! Isn't that something! People must be starving on special effects and anorexic of good storyline. I gave 1 star for this movie, and the other star is for Jake Gyllenhaal for having the courage to do a career-suicide movie. I mean I totally loved him in The Good Girl(Jennifer Aniston), and I am stunned that he did this movie. It's got more special effects than human characters. Even Dennis Quaid is in It! I mean he just did his career revival Far From Heaven less than 2 year ago, and now he adds this to his resume. It's as bad as Twister, and not as good as Deep Impact or Ammagedon. After some 20 minutes of seeing the disaster on earth, the story and the special effects started to go downhill. This is probably last year's Battlefield Earth, but it didn't lose any money.

R2DTCCFWUOWH3D,"A great premise, a formulaic response. Too many basic writing errors to tabulate here, but they would give a professional editor headaches. For example, I did a Kindle word search on ""glass"" and came up with 138 uses of the term. Over one hundred were people clinking glasses, filling and refilling glasses, glasses kissing, touching, ricocheting off one another, meeting; it's a wonder glasses weren't conversing or making loud, tough guy love with each other! And this is not to mention the multitude of mugs, cups, buckets, flasks, tubs, vessels and the like. Could the writer use another mechanism besides men sitting in parlors smoking, drinking, and talking obscurely and tough at one another?Do a search for cigars and find scores of people clipping them, stroking them, fumbling for them, fishing them out of pockets, and blowing all sorts of smoke at each other. Simply boring imagery, over and over again. Clouds continue to ""scud"" over the land, the smell of the nearby ocean continues to sneak in, over and over again. SheeZ!But these complaints deal just with the design of the action, the settings that are so repetitive. Bigger writing errors concern the characters. Foremost: All are creeps, one-dimensional and predictable. No one to like or follow here, no one to care about. They are, as a previous reviewer cited, just cardboard things set against the period. 500 pages into it, I couldn't care less for any of them. In fact, I just wanted to see them die. Not because I'm evil, but because I can't stand even fictional people be so inept and burdensome. A very inept piece of writing: saved, a little, by a few metaphorical allusions, but dreadful throughout. Shall we clink our glasses to that? No thanks.",0,0,0,0

R1RCGPN5RTYGJS,"I remember the first time I ever heard Britney Spears.  The song was 'Baby One More Time' and I couldn't believe what I was hearing on the radio...crap (if you believe that this entire review will be negative, please read on).  But since radio was playing her songs a million times, I learned to like that song as well as many that she has released.  Her recent material is far better than her earlier, straight-from-the-studio manufactured pop hits, and I was not surprised by her timely release of a greatest hits CD.  Many people have attacked her for this, but I will not.  What I will say is that there are only 3 great songs on this album of 'greatest hits'.  Toxic is the best club song she ever produced, I'm a Slave 4 You is a close second, but when you hear 'Baby One More Time' again you understand why it was so popular.  This is Britney's crowning achievment because at the time, there was nothing out there that sounded the same. And it brazingly marked the beginning of the ""Pop Starlets"" era, as Elton John likes to call them.  As for ""My Prerogative"", we had hoped that Britney would sound less like a studio and more like herself as she got older.  This song is the worst song she ever released. It destroys the original and, quite frankly, is not very easy on the ears.  She sounds like a muzzled mule. If you are hoping to get the best of Britney, this would definitely be it, and it's worth a whole lot more than buying each album.  Maybe for the public's sake, just as her first song started the era, her greatest hits cd will end it.",0,0,0,0

RBVC0DP41ALIK,"Reading Pynchon's Gravity's Rainbow is hard enough without deletions, typos, and occasional rewording of the authors original work. But that's what you get with this so-called ""Deluxe Edition"" put out by Penguin in 2006.Starting GR I realized I wasn't getting the full story (even though this is Pynchon), so I borrowed a 1973 edition and started comparing it to my Penguin ""Deluxe Edition"".

R1UZHG0TZGZ2XP,"Avoid; try Shoeboxed ([...]) with a scanner of your choice (I prefer flatbed). The sql database can be corrupted and rendered unusable by software or hardware crashes. Neat's solution for that is to provide a backup utility. Unfortunately, this backup of all data can take hours, and results in one very large file. As one other reviewer noted, such an extended procedure makes no sense for the home user that is just trying to add a few receipts and turn the computer off at night. Long and slow operations like this greatly increase the odds that the program will be interrupted by a crash. As another reviewer noted, its slowness makes it a bad choice for the business user as well. I didn't back up for a while; in my case, windows got corrupted and would not boot (don't know if the database was damaged). The partition can be read; all my wordprocessing, spreadsheet and pdf files can be opened; as far as this program goes, nothing. These problems seem inherent to sql; Neat may have chosen it to keep users dependent on them for data access. It would be a lot easier, faster, safer, and more appropriate for its intended non-server use to store pdf scans in folders and access them with a simple indexing program.

If you are diabetic, pre-diabietic, hypoglycemic, or have sugar cravings, read ATKINS DIABETES REVOLUTION, and for insulin dependent diabetes diets, read DR. BERNSTEIN'S DIABETES BOOK.  For a hormonal analysis, read THE AGE-FREE ZONE.  For an evolutionary analysis of diet and heredity, read THE METABOLIC TYPING DIET.  For further details on the danger of grain and sugar consumption, read THE NO-GRAIN DIET.THE MAKER'S DIET'S nutritional guidelines, insofar as they are present in the text, mimic Atkins in the beginning and then move toward The Zone.  However, the author gives very short shrift to these guidelines or to true nutritional analysis.  The majority of the book is a blend of half-baked biblical commentary and poorly-rendered theology, accented with pictures of an emaciated Rubin, in a seeming attempt to create shock value akin to looking at gory portraits of the crucifixion. As noted in another review, perhaps part of this shock is designed to spur the reader's purchases from Rubin's nutrition company.If true understanding of nutrition is important to you, do not rely on THE MAKER'S DIET to any extent.  In fact, the book is not worth reading.  It is noteworthy that the bookstores do not even keep ""THE MAKER'S DIET"" in the ""Diet, Health, and Nutrition"" sections of the store; they keep it inthe ""Religion"" section...There are many superb texts on religion and profound treatises concerning biblical analysis.

I thought about super gluing it, but that's not an option if I need to replace the ink, which I will at some point.

R1YEMC3CWJEB3X,"Mullen's Public Enemy saga features the Fireson family.  Patriarch Pop is a hard working man, the owner of small grocery stores, and a man attempting to improve the lives of his family through real estate investments.  Bad business partners and the crash have taken care of those dreams.  Although Pop has attempted to instill his three sons with his Horatio Alger values, oldest son Jason has taken to bootlegging to bring in money.  He is his father's greatest disappointment.  Younger brothers Whit and Weston seem to be following in Pop's foot steps until Pop is charged with the murder of a business partner and convicted.  Upon Pop's untimely death in prison, Jason turns to bank robbing, a more lucrative profession than bootlegging.  Against his best reasoning, Jason allows Whit to join his gang.  The Firesons soon become known as the Firefly Brothers because of their lightning fast robberies and getaways.  Younger brother  Weston continues to attempt an honest profession and is beginning to pay for his more notorious brothers' reputations.  However it is the proceeds of the Firefly Brothers' exploits that support the family.It is no spoiler to state that Jason and Whit begin their tale by waking from the dead following an incident they cannot remember.  Both have been shot.  They lie on cooling boards in a morgue in a small Indiana town.  As though their earlier exploits were not enough to raise them to mythic status, their continued appearances following the reports of their deaths certainly do.John Dillinger, Pretty Boy Floyd, Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker are all dead.  However, the Firefly Brothers continue to capture the imagination of victims of the economic plight of the great depression.  Torching mortgages in the banks they rob, giving food to the homeless in Hoovervilles across the country may seem to make them heroes.  However, the Firefly Brothers will not hesitate to kill whomever might be a threat to their success or their capture.During the books brightest moments, the times of the great depression are vividly portrayed.  There are episodes reminiscent of Davis Grubb's ""Fools' Parade"", Horace McCoy's ""They Shoot Horses, Don't They?"", and Edward Anderson's 1937 classic, ""Thieves Like Us"".Unfortunately, the brighter moments are obscured by the meaningless repeated resurrections of the Firefly Brothers.  The brothers make no changes in their lives for better or worse as they ponder their apparent immortality.Author Thomas Mullen's debut,""The Last Town on Earth"" was favorably reviewed by The Washington Post, a Chicago Tribune book of the year in 2006, and USA Today's Debut Novel of the Year.

R2548CSB77ZNQW,"I have had the portable scanner for several years.  I use it to scan all my receipts for personal use.  I also use quicken.  The original software ""proprietary system of filing"" was OK, but not great.  I was able to use it to handle all of my receipts, 5-10 a day.  The software recognition at that time was not great requiring me to edit all of my receipts, but I learned how to use it.Upgrading to the 5.0, the software filing system that now comes with the scanner, has been more frustrating than any other software experience.  Other than Quicken's biyearly extortion, this takes the cake.  With Quicken you begrudgingly pay the fee because in the end, the program still works and even with all the problems and the fact that it is not perfect, you always know you can get by with it.Now the scanner with the new 5.0 software seems to do a much better job of recognizing the information on the receipt and getting it correct.  However, the filing system and program is far from intuitive requiring a significant amount of time reviewing the instructions.  Even then, again, it is not intuitive and also it is cumbersomely slow.If you have 100 receipts in a folder, you can count on the program taking over 20 seconds to load.  This means that switching between folders is time consuming and frustrating.  Accidentally clicking a folder with 2-300 receipts will have your blood pressure up and your anger at a maximum as there is nothing you can do until the computer loads the entire folder.  Each folder is loaded as you click on it, again and again, so if you go from one folder to another, you must wait each time.It is a great concept, but the software based on my use and based on my readings of what professional software developers have to say on the internet is nearly worthless unless you are only storing a few receipts a month.I wanted this program to easily search through years of receipts in order for me not to have to go through hundreds of receipts by hand in multiple shoe boxes of receipts.  When I need a receipt for a return, I wanted to search it on the computer and find where it is to make getting the original easier.  Just having the receipts on the computer does not help as most stores will not accept a printed copy of the receipt.  For on line purchaces and warranty, it is useful if transmitting a copy of the receipt will work.  However, I find most still want you to mail the original.  This means you still must have a hard copy in a filing cabinet and an antiquated filing system to parallel this computerized version.  Still the concept and how I used it worked pretty good.  However, the new software makes the supposedly easy time saving task a Herculean effort.  After spending all the money on the product and years of use, I find that a good file cabinet with folders works much better and easier than the new 5.0 upgrade or rather what is currently being sold.Here is what I want to be able to do with the system.  I want to double click on the icon and have the program boot immediately.  I want to take the receipts from my wallet and scan them quickly into the scanner.  I then want to review my receipts from an un-reviewed folder and migrate them into the proper folders.  This was the way the older program worked.  I want to switch back and forth from folder to folder and have the folder already loaded and available like the old program or Quicken, so I don't have to wait for each folder to load, each time.  I don't want to have to limit my folder sizes because the program takes too long to load a folder with more than 10 receipts.  These are the things I want from a system, but sadly the new 5.0 upgrade and program that is sold with the scanners today does not deliver.As a stand alone portable scanner, it has given me years of trouble free use.  So far I really have nothing bad to say about the actual physical tool.  I appreciate the improvements in receipt recognition with the 5.0 upgrade as it is rather good.  However, the program is just not intuitive, it is not easy, and it is frustratingly slow and cumbersome to the point of annoyance.The one star rating may not be totally accurate as there are good things to say about this, but in the end the negatives make this nearly unusable as an efficient way to digitally file receipts and I could not in good conscience get someone to invest the time and effort into a new filing system that does not make their filing easier.  You still need hard copies of receipts for just about everything but the IRS.  The old physical filing cabinet and folders worked great for probably over 100 years and being you still need it, I cant say the effort of digitizing the receipts with this system is worth your time and effort the way it currently stands.",0,0,0,0

R3R9URA3U3H53M,"This is a book by a group of Revisionist scholars whose specialty is casting doubt on the origins and beliefs of Islam.  Google 'Norbert Pressburg'  to see their other works.  On a decent reading, I found this book to be tilted toward the conclusion that there can be no 'Islam' and an anti-Arab take on the rise and spread of Islamic civilization in the Middle East, North Africa and Spain.  I regret that I wasted my Vine Voice choice in selecting it for review.  In one sense, this book is flawed scholarship: even if Mohammed never existed, 'Islam' does.  Its followers know what the faith means, regardless of whether they are Arabic or Berber or whatever.I am among those 'non-sectarian' people who believe, as do faithful Muslims, that God is One and without Partner; that God neither begets nor is begotten.'  So, I find this book to be a very negative view of one of the major faiths of the world.  It is also a negative view of the cultural contributions of Islamic society--attributing the accomplishments of its 'Golden Ages' to members of other faiths or of non-Arabic cultures, while discounting the shared Islamic foundation of those peoples and places.  Indeed, this book is one-sided in a systematic way; the way that arouses scepticism in intellectual readers.Likely, Mohamed was not literate:  many cultures transmit their basic ideas orally, as did the ancient Greeks who recited Homeric poetry. As with Christianity, teachings and revelations were written down and/or revised at a later time. Much of Islam flows from its (acknowledged) Judeo-Christian roots. Mohamed repeatedly refers to Jews and Christians as 'people of the book' and says he is offering a new book of perfected revelation from the same, one God. Pressburg reaches too far, into trying to say Islam is a 'bogus' faith based on intellectually questionable premises.  The author relies on linguistic 'nit-picking' and saying the 'Faith' must be wrong because the linguistic roots of many concepts are not 'Arabic.'  Well, the concepts that were incorporated from past revelations were not purely 'Arabic 'and the words attached to them were probably influenced by Greek, Aramaic, Hebrew and so on. The author even points out as much but he draws an unjustified conclusion from the shared intellectual heritage to lean on the thought that since the 'Arabic' is not pure, the content can not be 'true.'  How are these two propositions logically related?  To my mind, 'Faith' speaks to us across linguistic boundaries and the 'Ideas' from whatever religious source, borrowed or not, can be compounded to make a religion worthy of worship and of respect.I feel this book only feeds anti-Islamic sentiment.  It has nothing to offer a 'Modern Martyr' other than the notion that they are 'dying for nothing.'  It offers no message for Islamic society other than their greatest moments were the product of non-Islamic contributors.  How can reviewers accept such a one-sided analysis as this book offers?Most Muslims and readers from other faiths would agree that today's self-appointed 'martyrs' have fallen into error.  The mullahs who preach jihad focus on but a small part of the faith.  However,this book does not do justice to Islam; it does not do well at presenting the Quranic view of a proper society, the importance of God's mercy and mankind's struggle for Salvation.  It does not even do well at explaining any religious, or cultural aspect of martyrdom or its supposed rewards.  I do not like to see Islam or its faithful followers disparaged in this way.",0,0,0,0

R3URTVKCZSCCP,"First, I use my printer for business, personal documents and graphics. I did a ton of research before picking this printer, which I've had about a year now, and settled on it because of the large format, pages per cartridge, and good reviews. What the hay do people print on this that they are left liking this printer?Print quality - sucks in color. Black & white is fine, but the color is faded regardless of what medium you print on, even when set for ""best"" printing and ""vivid"" coloring. Rich red looks like faded brick. Browns look gray. Everything has a grayish cast, actually. Nothing pops.Prints per cartridge - one of the other major factors I chose this printer for was the touted prints per cartridge. Maybe I could get that many out of cartridge IF IT ACTUALLY USED MORE THAN 2/3 OF THE INK IN THE DARN CARTRIDGE! I bet I get the same or less as comparable machines.Mediums - it SAYS it will print on card stock. Sure, if by ""card stock"" you use nothing over 60 lb. paper. If you use card stock, you know this is basically resume paper. Actual card stock will jam.every.single.time. you hit print for every.single.sheet. And, yes, this means most labels won't feed smoothly either. Excellent. And I for sure can't run fabric through like I could on my HP all-in-one.Paper size - this, unlike most, will print 11x17 large format paper. It will, however, require you to completely withdraw the paper cartridge and pull a dozen parts in various directions to make it big enough. And yes, you'll have to do this same operation, only slightly less complicated, for every different size of paper. THERE IS NO MANUAL FEED with which to print a few envelopes quickly. If you are doing letters, you will have to print the letter, pull out the tray and paper, manipulate the interior, put in the envelopes, replace the tray and THEN finally print the envelope, even if you are only doing one. What.a.pain. Sure you could use labels instead, except that it struggles to print things as thick as labels, remember? Large format also often leaves ink residue in the margins.What IS right with this machine - was relatively easy to set up. Wireless convenience is terrific (note: not compatible with my daughter's alphasmart, so make sure whatever you think you'll be printing from IS compatible). But wireless is in other brands, too, so that's not an advantage specific to this printer. Scanner, fax are both satisfactory.So, if you are debating between this and another brand of printer, pick the other printer. I wish I did.",0,0,0,0

R309CAV8VEBTVW,"I was hoping for better, second manufacturer of ink I ordered, after first one didn’t even get recognized by printer. I read the reviews, mostly positive, so I was hopeful when I ordered. Good sign, the little light came on like the others, and the level indicator showed me they were full. Okay, great... now, for the real test. I did a printer head cleaning, ran a test page. Not great, didn’t look like it was giving me any ink from the gray and black tanks I had replaced. Next, tried printing return labels (regular paper, bar code label printing like we used to have to do for Amazon returns) for stuff I needed to send out. Major fail—the bar codes were missing data, the print quality was crap. I tried repeating with color vs b/w, no improvement. Wasted a lot of OEM color ink trying to troubleshoot this mess. Finally realized that the one-star reviews had it right; I’m not a high end user, wasn’t trying to print photo quality or anything. Just wanted to print a darned shipping return label or three. If it’s not good enough for the text to be readable, it’s useless. Needless to say, it’s getting returned.",0,0,0,0

R1LUG596Y40NWF,"I received a copy of this book from the publisher in return for a review.  I've put off reviewing it because it wasn't my kind of book.  I hate publishing negative reviews--I know how much work goes into getting all those words out onto the page, and so when I read something that's not my style, I just put it down and move on.But I agreed to a review, so here we go:Stumbling on Open Ground by Ken Mansfield shares the experience of the author and his wife during two bouts of cancer.  Earlier in his life, the author worked with the Beatles, and I suspect that is why his story was published. The story is written in a straightforward way, with input from both of them. Perhaps the story did not resonate with me because there were not enough bridges between the author's life and mine (or that of anyone I know) to make it feel universal. But fans of ""behind the scenes"" books about the music industry might enjoy this story.",0,0,0,0
R2050U8C76UYUX,"Two-Week Final Update. I tried and tried and gave it every chance. It wouldn't stay connected no matter what. What sealed the return deal was I unplugged it one last time to make it connect - buttons nor off switch would do the trick - and it didn't stay connected long enough for me to get back to my chair and print. This is NOT a printer, at least not one I would ever endorse.Day 3 8/8/19: Wouldn't wake up today to print. Had to physically go to it and bring it out of sleep. This is NOT a solution for the long term. If this cannot be fixed it will go back.Day 1 8/6/19: Functions well. Dash replenishment setup didn't work. That's probably a blessing. Too much info being shared and hacked these days anyway. It's not an important function for me, though the $20 credit would have been nice. Scans look good, though I need to do more testing. I have things setup the way I like them, just waiting for some real world situations rather than test cases.Will be using this for my home business and will likely get the secondary paper tray.

R3IVNA29BD3KTM,"I was conflicted over this book. One the one hand, he has some valid points, valuable, about eating food closer to the natural state, and avoiding processed food.But so much of what he has to offer in this book is just tripe.Vaccination - he recommends one avoid this. Why does his personal nutritional experience qualify him to speak against the single most life-saving advance in human medical history? There is no valid evidence that vaccines cause autism - the originator of that claim was thouroughly debunked, for fraud and inadequate sample size. The issue has been examined to exhaustion, and the scientific consensus is that vaccines play no role in the autism problem.  In any case, the autism issue is a child specific problem - why would a rational adult assume that vaccines pose a substantial risk to themselves?His ignorance of,vaccination benefits was the single most damning thing I found in his material.He recommends raw milk products in favor of those that are pasteurized. Raw milk has killed many people. Unless you own a cow or goat, and get it from the source, you are taking a terrible risk in consuming raw dairy. The supposed benefit has not been documented in any sort of peer-reviewed paper. I consider this recommendation to be foolish at best, deadly at worst.Raw food is of importance on this diet. I will certainly agree that one should not cook where not merited, but does anyone really take this seriously, outside of fruits and vegetables? How many would eat raw flesh? That has a long history of being a good way to die or obtain parasites. If raw is good for fruits and vegetables, why is it less good for animal flesh?I am happy that he found a path back to health, and established a commercial enterprise in the process.I cannot, however, take his pronouncements seriously, beyond a respect for his basic message of 'eat real food, not processed food'. Chlorine is preferable to cholera. Flouride in the water is biochemically unavaliable - and yes, elemental flouride is hideously dangerous. But free flourine is not in your toothpaste, or your water, and if you don't like your water distill it.His most basic message - diet matters - is correct. But he has lots to say about other things, many of which I find suspect, wrong, or preachy.Take the book with some skepticism - but there is some value there. which is why I give it two stars.Thanks for reading this.",0,0,0,0

R2F4C63LTAX5FP,"I utterly detested this slick and glittery but pretentious and shallow attempt at a ""buddy film,"" first of all because it reminds me of the scores of insufferable, nauseating, viciously condescending yuppie ""wine snob"" phonies I have often encountered.Jack and Miles were just utterly loathsome and completely pathetic characters; their whiny immaturity,  aimless self-conscious materialism, fierce self-absorption and utter cluelessness was just awful and quite unfunny for a film that claims to be a sophisticated and deft comedy/satire--the tragic thing is that scores of people here in Southern California these days are just like those two if not worse; like Miles and Jack, they seem to quickly grow old without ever really growing up. Worse, these overgrown boys are quite thoughtlessly destructive; blithely creating meaningless tragedies all along the way while not learning much of anything useful or life-changing.What's most unfortunate is that this picture had great potential to be a clever and brutal satire lambasting the greedy, pretentious snobbery, barely concealed sadism and exhaustingly neurotic phoniness of so many upper-class (and upper-class wannabe) Southern Californians, but the director, Alex Payne (whose prior films, ""Citizen Ruth,"" ""Election"" and ""About Schmidt"" were superb) seems to have dropped the ball. Two grown, unmarried, presumably heterosexual men going on a ""wine tasting"" road trip together? Face it, it's absurd, but with a different director (say, Christopher Guest or Alex Cox) it could have been hilarious, a male version of the wonderful Britcom ""Absolutely Fabulous,"" perhaps.In view of films like ""Sideways,"" it appears that over the past 30 odd years the time-honored American ""buddy film"" concept, sadly, has degenerated significantly, falling from the heights of deep, gritty and often amusing and touching studies about male friendship to the pathetic current lows of castrated, juvenile, prissy, lily-livered, mutual whining. I think of such ""buddy"" films of the past, the best of them from the 1970s (e.g., ""Scarecrow"" with Al Pacino and Gene Hackman; ""Thunderbolt & Lightfoot"" with Clint Eastwood and Jeff Bridges; ""The In-Laws"" with Alan Arkin and Peter Falk; ""Bang The Drum Slowly"" with Robert DeNiro and Michael Moriarty) and they easily stand head and shoulders above transparently self-indulgent yuppie trash like ""Sideways.""I give ""Sideways"" two stars only because it had done a fine job of capturing and reflecting the bucolic beauty of California's largely still-rural central coast.",0,0,0,0

R2WTG2C3I8LTD4,"Remember the old days when Robert DeNiro used to be in good movies?  Taxi Driver, Casino, Goodfellas, Heat and others?  In Hide and Seek, DeNiro's role choices continue to flounder as he stars in a sub-par horror film.DeNiro plays David, a psychologist whose wife has killed herself in apparent depression.  His daughter Emily (played by Dakota Fanning) sees the body and becomes semi-catatonic.  In a effort to heal, the two move to a new home in a rural community.  Instead of improving, Emily acquires a seemingly invisible friend named Charlie.  Charlie starts out okay, but soon gets increasingly malicious.  The mystery is if Charlie is a real person, a supernatural entity or some dark aspect of Emily's personality.For the first two-thirds of Hide and Seek, we get a strictly by-the-book horror movie, neither particularly good nor bad.  Sadly, everything falls apart at the end as we find out Charlie's true nature.  I won't spoil things by explaining Charlie, but suffice it to say that the explanation involves one of the most tired clichés in horror/suspense and also requires deceit and illogic to force a plot twist on the audience.The only plus to this movie is Dakota Fanning, who continues to show that she is the best child actor currently in movies, using actual talent where most kids merely depend on cuteness.  She cannot save this film, however; while at least passable for a while, the conclusion of this movie pushes its overall quality to a weak two stars.

RL5LETBU20WE9,"To put it simply, I'm shocked and amazed at the rave reviews this book has gotten.  Perhaps the praise is for the plot, but I suppose I'll never know because I gave up after page 30.I don't think I've ever picked up a published book that was written this poorly.  I teach writing classes, was an English major in college, and write for a living, so I do tend to have a critical eye when it comes to these things.  From the first few pages, it's obvious that this is the work of a first-time writer.  The prose is flat, stumbling, and amateurish.  What really amazed me, though, were all the grammar and punctuation errors.  Yes, I know that fiction authors---especially those purporting to write ""literature""---can take poetic license in their writing, but this book is filled with mistakes so glaring that I couldn't possibly go past the first few chapters.  I found myself wondering, where was the editor?  Even if the plot and characters were excellent, this book needed much, much more work before it was ever published.  As it reads now, it's just sloppy.",0,0,1,1

We were in a hurry to get a new printer because our old one suddenly broke. We FAILED to read the reviews!I use printers primarily to print out pictures. This is by far the worst photo printer I've ever used! The quality (I'm using Epson cartridges, not even compatible generics. So there's no excuse!) is awful! I'm using the same photo papers I've been using for years, so no excuse there either. The photos are set to print on glossy photo papers and high quality, but there's no vivid photo option like some other printers, maybe because it's simply not capable of making anything thing ""vivid"". I'm having to drastically increased my photo contrast in order to make the photos look borderline acceptable. It also takes 4-5 minutes per 8.5x11 page of high quality photo printing. That is 4-5 min per page of awful noise I also have to put up with.The low ink cartridge notification is unrelenting. There's an orange light that would flash all day, all night, despite my acknowledging *OK*. Then when the printer decides the ink is actually out OUT, it stops printing and beeps. WHO DOES THAT?I'm trying to print some pictures out as I'm writing this review. F* this, I'm going out to buy a different printer today! And I'm not going to be getting an Epson!

R3NJOOKYVLWDIF,"I purchased two of these cartridges a little less than a year ago, so this review speaks volumes about the longevity of this product.When I initially installed and started using this product, I would have given it five stars in a heartbeat. It worked great for about 4 or 5 months, but then the issues began. I started getting streaking toner and what looked like low toner levels (after ~400 pages). I am a tech savvy grad student, so I did all of the troubleshooting including cleaning the cartridge, shaking it, reinstalling, etc. The cartridge had most of the toner remaining in it, but I could not get it to print without issues. Nothing worked.I finally gave up and installed the second cartridge. It worked like a charm......for about 4 or 5 months. The same issues with streaking and light printing started occurring with this cartridge as well. I print about 1000 pages per year, so these two cartridges should have lasted (theoretically) 5 years. In reality, they lasted less than a year.If you do the math, the price per page is equivalent to the Brother cartridge, which is disappointing.

I feel it is poorly written and has little to keep you engaged.  You get no real feel for the main people in the book and the constant questioning of Don Juan that is refused an answer, or that receives some pseudo spiritual response, is extremely tedious.  The hallucinogenic visions are uninspiring to read and the interpretations are spurious.  The second half that attempts to analyse the 'lessons' from the experiences is jargon laden and tries to be too clever.  As a text explaining various Yaqui rituals it has some merit, and it's explanations of drug preparation is fairly clear, but you can get this information online without trawling through such uninspiring dross.  I have read many, many books of a spiritual nature,  as well as many books on a variety of topics, as my varied and extensive reviews will illustrate, and I'm really sad to have given a book so highly praised by others such a low review, but I really disliked this book and felt it has very little to offer in terms of spiritual message.  Easier reads, with clearer messages are out there (The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho, or Way of the Peaceful Warrior by Dan Millman to name two mainstream books and a whole host of more in-depth and meaningful books) and this book only serves to muddy what should be ones clear path to deeper spiritual growth.

Photos made from slides are particularly terrible. I would say results from any enlargement are unsatisfactory for any purpose.I don't blame Epsen. Their products are generally as good as their competitors, often better. I think the problem - at least for me - is that I believed the hype that high end scanners produce professional or near-professional results. This claim leads to unrealistic expectations for people who know what professional work looks like. The results are barely good enough to send copies of pictures to close family members. You certainly could not use one of these scanners in a professional endeavor, or even for serious hobby work.It makes great copies of text, but so do scanners that cost $100.

R2FRQ4W4X39C7E,"Wow.These are the universally worst reviews I've ever read for a single title.  Usually among critics, it's possible to find some fans.  Not with this one.Now I find myself in a pickle--after having waited a year for this title to become available at my public library (there were that many people wanting it!) I finally get my hands on a copy & settled down gleefully to catch up on Scarpetta's latest juicy installment.  Immediately I sensed something amiss--Cornwell abandons her first-person narration in Kay's voice (a strong voice for a heretofore strong character) in favor of a weird disembodied third-person omniscent voice IN THE PRESENT TENSE.('Scarpetta examines the maggot by her dinner plate.')  What is THIS?  It has the effect of totally distancing us from our protagonist.  Instead of getting into Kay's psyche as we did in other books, we're examining her like one of her lab samples on a slide.  I don't like this feeling--it's so jarring, I don't know if I can continue.  After reading everyone's reviews here, I don't know that I WANT to continue past the couple chapters I've managed so far.What a shame.  Kay does deserve better than this.  But the last good book in this series was 1999's 'Point of Origin'.  'Black Notice' & 'Last Precinct' were weak efforts.But this one's full of maggots.  I'm giving it 2 stars rather than one, only because it takes a considerable amount of effort to write 500 pages, even if they're bad pages.  But what a waste of time and effort for everyone concerned--the writer, the editors (who obviously were out to lunch), the publisher, the bookstores and libraries that have to process and stock this title, and most of all, us the readers, who invest our time in it and don't receive any payback, certainly not a big fat royalty check!Patricia Cornwell--shame on you.",0,0,0,0

I have read all of the Kingfountain books, and most of the Muirwood series. I have liked the Kingfountain series very much. The characters are likable, indeed, many too good to be believed. I enjoyed how  the author has developed Trynne into a very strong, powerful woman. But I HIGHLY object to the attitude of ""women must sacrifice and be subservient to do the will of The Fountain/God"" and they will *like* it. I can't say details without giving spoilers, but I find the ending ridiculous and offensive to Trynne's character. I have a feeling it will be turned around in the last book, but nothing will undo the action Trynne took at the end of this book, and this male fantasy that ""if I'm powerful enough I can get what ever woman I want"".

To say that the quality of the box is completely and absolutely unacceptable doesn't even begin to convey exactly how astonishingly poor the box quality is.

R2AVSZ9BJ3ZEIS,"I am blown away by the almost universal acclaim attached to this book. This book sat on my shelf for a time while I practically salivated to read it, forcing myself to finish other series I had already started before starting a new one. The reviews on the inside cover were raving, as were the ones on Amazon. Finally couldn't wait any longer and tore through it in a few days. I must have been reading a different book.This isn't a novel as much as it is 400+ pages of prologue with a quick story tacked on to the end. The amount of time we spend with Meg as she navigates what amounts to a desk job is nauseating. Her every trip to the store for supplies is documented, stealing nearly all the page time away from actual plot. Here is Meg learning how to sort the mail. Here is Meg learning how to charge an electric powered car. Here is Meg deciding where she would like to keep the pencils. Here is Meg ordering a bunch of dog beds from a pet store catalog. You get it. 75% of the story is spent providing me details about things that are so marginal and far removed from the plot that it just comes out as a bunch of scatterbrained word vomit. It sinks the entire novel, what little is left. An editor could have taken a machete to this and come away with maybe 100 usable pages.It's hard to talk about the other finer points of the novel, because it lives in the shadow of all this unnecessary uninteresting fluff. However, in an effort try to find the positive in this mess, I will concede that there was good in this novel. The writing itself is sharp, if relatively simple, and the world imagined has a lot of potential. The blood prophet fantasy visual is unique and keeps the fantasy aspects fresh. The political angle about the balance between humans and fantasy creatures is engaging, but it also has some logic holes that keep it from being fully realized. Some of the characters are interesting, most notably Simon, but with the enormous cast of people that the author dumps in our lap over the course of the novel, the characterization of many fall completely flat. It won't be uncommon for a reader to see a name and have to think back to when this character was last mentioned and whether or not they made any contribution to the plot (Most likely not).This was my first rodeo with this author and I won't be reading anything else she writes. I'm curious though and had an honest question for the people who have apparently fallen in love with this series. Are all the books like this? Do we ever get to a point where we have an actually driving plot with maybe a few twists and turns along the way? Genuinely curious. This book obsesses with details that frankly don't matter and the story suffers greatly because of it. One honest guy's opinion.",0,0,0,0

R3DVBLC7HPMPPT,"Wait, then why did I rate them two stars? THE SHIPPING! These bins are shipped ASSEMBLED and stacked - taking up about 3x as much space as opposed to stacking them with the lids off. It is dumb and nonsensical. It’s been like this for over a year (edit: 4 years), when I began buying these things by the dozen. What this awful shipping translates to is this:Higher product price or shipping price.Lower Prime availability.Longer shipping times.Increased chance of shipping damage (I have had two incidents) (edit: 4), not only because the box is bigger but the bins have greater durability when stacked inside each other.Also there is never any packaging inside the box.Fix the shipping!!As for the bins themselves - great bins. Very modular, clear, easily washable (may warp in the dishwasher), decently water resistant, fit paper perfectly. Will probably crack if you drop it. I take a pair of snips and cut off all the alignment tabs that keep the lids together when they’re stacked, that way I can fill the bins higher.Edit: it's been like 4 years since I started buying these, and I've amassed at least 60. They still haven't fixed the shipping, and that goes for any size of this type of bin. Even Walmart receives them stacked, I've seen them unloading. I don't understand. Oh well... if you are a organizational perfectionist, these are the bins for you.Also, I realized the ""alignment tabs"" are actually just remnants of the plastic extrusion process, they don't align anything. There's no harm in cutting them off! Use flush cutters. The plastic does usually get hairline cracks when you do this but I haven't had any problems or broken lids from it, even with 4 year old bins that I frequently drop. You could probably cut and sand them with a Dremel if you're worried about cracks. Kind of obnoxious they leave them at this price point.

I would say that this book had some good points and several bad points.  The plot was good .  The writing , though, was too much like a paper you would write for college or like required reading sometimes is.  Maybe the descriptions to set the scenes were unnecessarily long .  Or, maybe it was that the chapters didn't flow into one another which resulted in a given chapter telling the reader a character's actions and thoughts ;  but, it felt like the chapters were only doing that and could have been shuffled around without losing the story line.  The disconnect between chapters made it seem as though they could easily have been  written by different people who only got together to ""glue"" the chapters to make it into one book.  It read more like a text book than a good mystery.  Maybe that is what made reading it heavy going.

R2W80SL86W9K4U,"I purchased these cartridges right after buying some HP cartridges with the intention that I would use them when my new HPs ran out.  When the time came, I installed the black first.  It initially worked fine, but after a few uses the ink began to gum up the print heads (HP ink didn't do this).  I had to run multiple cleaning cycles to try to get them clean - so many so that I need to change out the color cartridges just from cleaning.  Unfortunately, the Kingway color cartridges did not work at all.  The printer did not even recognize them as being installed.  So, not only is the ink cheap so that it gums up your printer, the chip set is cheap and only works some of the time or is incompatible with the printers for which it was designed.If that were not enough to steer you away, after my purchase, the company immediately begin contacting me about writing a review.  I am not a regular poster of reviews - I'm just a normal shopper.  But holy cow did they want that review!

Sorting all reviews by ""most helpful"" comments shows there are ""real"" reasons for negative reviews based upon readers' negative and even positive perceptions of the book and series. You may agree or disagree with the ""validity"" of these reasons but the important point is that someone READ the book and spent time justifying their reviews. Contrast this with the number of ""five star"" reviews that are only a couple of banal sentences that could apply to any book, whether it was read or not.

R1V3WZCMPKTSV0,"I give this Blu-Ray disc one star only because there is no option to give it zero stars.  If there were such an option, it would get zero stars.I would have enjoyed this film, if ONLY it would have been playable.  But it wasn't.The disc arrived and due to two deaths in the family that happened right after it arrived, I was not able to try to play it for several weeks thereafter.When I was finally able to put it in my nearly brand new Sony Blu-ray player, all that would display was the Criterion Collection logo.  No menu screen, no response to hitting any buttons on either the player or the remote. Nothing.I figured that the specific disc that I received had a sample defect, so I ordered another one.  The second one arrived a few days later.  Same problem.  Lovely logo, I must say.I returned both of them but received a refund for only one of the two that I returned. They would not refund the first one because it was more than 30 days after I received it, and they disclaimed returns after 30 days.Not only did I not get to see this otherwise terrific Charlie Chaplin film, I had to pay for a disc that wouldn't play and could not get a refund.  They still have my money and I have nothing.  I don't even have the unplayable disc.If they weren't going to refund that, then they should have sent it back to me. Then at least I could have put it on the Christmas tree.  ON the tree, not under it:  as an ornament, mind you, not as a gift.So after all of that I was more than slightly amused when I received an e-mail today inviting my review of their wonderful product.

R3FXZH05WPX4EI,"It feels like we just had this conversation, so for those of you that didn't make it to the Burt Wonderstone review, it went something along the lines of:  some television stars don't always translate very well to the big screen.  Well, much like Steve Carrell in The Incredible Burt Wonderstone, here we are again with big time, little screen actress, Tina Fey (she masters her television craft on NBC's 30 Rock).  A few years back, Tina Fey and Steve Carrell took to the big screen in a film called, Date Night, which you might have safely assumed would translate to a rivetingly funny film experience.  There's only one little problem with that:  it wasn't funny and more importantly, she wasn't funny.  The point is (and yes, we've gotten a little off base here) just because Tiny Fey has a boatload of television awards doesn't mean she has what it takes to make it on the big screen.  Although, in her defense, she hasn't really taken on an overpowering film role as she does in the quaint little comedy, Admission.Directed by Paul Weitz (American Pie & Little Fockers), Admission stars Tina Fey as Portia Nathan, an ambitious Princeton University admissions officer that stumbles upon a high school prodigy student, Jeremiah Balakian (Nat Wolff), in a back woods high school run by the free spirited John Pressman (Paul Rudd).  After her initial visit to the high school, Portia is caught off guard when Pressman tells her that she is the mother of the prodigy (the child she gave up for adoption).  Pressman informs Portia that Jeremiah desperately wants to attend Princeton, but doesn't have the credentials that are typically required to get into Princeton - thus seeking her help to get him admitted.  Michael Sheen, Lily Tomlin, and Wallace Shawn also star in supporting roles.It should be no surprise to hear that this is Tina Fey's best performance to date on the big screen - since she obviously doesn't have an extensive resume in that department just yet.  However, her character is a bit of a scatter-brained elitist that is difficult to sympathize with or relate to at any point of the story.  Upon first meeting her character, she's in a direct competition to become the next dean of admissions for Princeton, and the next thing you know, she goes to a random high school, meets its random supervisor, culminating in him telling her (randomly) that he has found her son - and naturally her next reaction is to make out with him.  By any definition, that's either a pretty unorthodox trip - or really bad storytelling.In any event, Admission is a comedy with the best of intentions at heart.  It's certainly an interesting story as it unfolds (depicting an extremely bothersome college admission process), but at the end of the day, it's still a comedy, and comedies are supposed to be funny.  The film has a few of those embarrassing ""I just can't look"" moments, but for the most part, the humorous moments come from Lily Tomlin in her portrayal of Portia's uptight mother.  Straight out of a high school student's worst nightmare, one scene has Tomlin firing a shotgun at Paul Rudd as he drops Portia off at her mother's house - a scene in which Tomlin's character humorously misinterprets as an unwanted romantic advance on her daughter.Other ""comedic"" scenes, however, do not work so well in the film.  One particular scene is meant to depict the prodigy student as ""too smart for the rest of us"" as he does a ventriloquist act at a birthday party.  Elitist jokes are all fine and dandy - if they work for the scene.  Yet, just because a kid displays a great deal of charisma and rattles off the names of a bunch of classic authors that most people have never heard of doesn't necessarily entitle him admittance to Princeton.  It's truly unfortunate that scenes like this try so hard to be smart, only to miss the mark and land right on their face - thus severely handicapping the quality of the film.Overall, the premise of Admission is sound, yet the dialogue and whacky plot are too ambitious for their own good.  A few cheap laughs every now and then can't overshadow a plot that's unsustainably choppy and unemotional.  Fey and Rudd get average marks for chemistry, but in the end, there's very little value to be seen here.Overall Film Grade:  DFNDNreview.com",0,0,0,0

R1EY43HXTO0ASF,"Pros:  I was impressed with the ease of putting the stand together.  All parts were well marked with small ABC labels - and the labels were either on the underside or in a place where you wouldn’t see them if you didn’t remove them once the unit was put together.  I think I checked every assembly point and from what I could tell, the stand only goes together one way and I really liked that.  There was very little verbiage on the instructions and it was almost all pictures (which isn’t really a pro or con).  The cart rolls really nicely.Cons:  The top is actually in 3 pieces and they do not completely meet because of the underneath supporting bracket.  More importantly, the supporting bracket does NOT hold the top level at all.  I saw that another reviewer suggested using washers and I tried that, but it’s still not level and I’m afraid that it I add more, the screws won't support the top.",0,0,0,0

None of the exercises in this book can soften or assuage grief. Although I do agree with the myths about grief mentioned in the book: Time heals all wounds, replace your loss, be strong for others, etc. Nonsense. We must feel it, express it, share it, cry over it, understand it. But in the end, grief is just painful. You live with it. You don't get over it.

R26KR1IOKINP3,Ultraviolet takes place in a dystopian future where the world has been divided between people infected with a disease that makes them vampires and the humans. The vampires created a resistance with Ultraviolet (Milla Jovovich) being one of the main insurgents. She ends up standing up to both sides to try to rescue a child.The first thing about the movie is that seeing Jovovich in a futuristic action movie is that the viewer immediately thinks of the Resident Evil franchise she starred in. It is a very similar role and has a similar look as well with lots of computer graphics. Also like that series there’s just a bit on the story and then the rest of the movie is one big chase and gun battle. Basically Ultraviolet couldn’t escape the shadow of Jovovich’s other movies and suffered as a result.C,0,0,0,0

R2MXDQYI3NVHIV,"Well, Looks like I should of forked out the extra money for the new one, since I have had to get a replacement already! Received it in time but when I hooked it up, no go! The premise is nice, receive a discounted rate for a ""Certified Refurbished"" unit, but only if it WORKS! I would have rather spent the last 2 hours that I have spent on the phone with Ooma customer service, tech support and escalation reps, at the DENTIST or even outside. The money saved is not worth the hassle of what I went through to get one that actually works. Not only was the ethernet cable provided broken, but the port itself is blown. I would like to think that quality assurance would check these units BEFORE they ship and that mine just HAPPENED to miss EVERY quality check, but this sure steers me away from buying another refurb product period.Granted, Ooma is replacing a new unit for this one, so while troubleshooting this with them they did provide a replacement so I did not have to contact the seller, even though I did, but the amount of time spent getting a replacement is not worth it for this customer.  I still have to make a call back to Ooma to get credit for the time I have been unable to use this product when I ACTUALLY get a working one, since you have to sign up BEFORE you activate, so essentially I am in the hole with this purchase.

R2L8ECJ32U4JBQ,"The workmanship is shoddy.  First of all, the picture showed a cup of coffee sitting on what appeared to be a hard surface, which was the part of the pouch that went over the arm.  Well, that ""hard surface"" is a piece of cardboard, like shirt cardboard, and it is not attached to the pouch in any way.  So to use it, it just sits in a little area with folds of material to hold it in.  Of course, the folds of cloth do not hold it in, or even come close. So the top of the pouch is worthless for any purpose.  Also, after less than a month, the stitching in the pockets is coming undone.  Also, as I have seen in other reviews, it doesn't stay on the arm of a chair very well.  Its like a balancing act puzzle how much stuff has to be in each side to keep the pouch from slipping.

Example: scomfished, never read the 'Three Bears,' consequences to health of uncontrolled feeling.I can't put a light on any of these expressions. Therefore, I should have purchased the Penguin Classic edition which has pages upon pages of explanatory notes. It also has an introduction which, at times, can be helpful, but not always.I find it odd that Penguin Books didn't issue the Red Classic novel with notes.

R3MP2IPRTAMETV,"I read the generally very positive reviews for this film and checked to see whether it was on Prime - it wasn't so I decided to order a cheap used DVD of it so I could see it for myself.  I wish I hadn't bothered!  This film is SO pretentious and the situations in it are so far-fetched it's hard not to laugh at times, despite it being a supposed drama / thriller.  There are an awful lot of ridiculously 'coincidental' scenarios, i.e. Lisa leaving her booklet with the pass to her room at The Drake in the phone booth.  I mean … really?  What on earth was the likelihood of that happening in real life!  Josh Hartnett's acting was wooden and annoying, Matthew Lillard was playing Matthew Lillard, even Rose Byrnes was annoying and wishy-washy in her role.  The only good acting was by Diane Kruger who was believable.  I got so bored with this film even less than halfway through that I literally forced myself to stay watching it in the hope that it would get better - sadly it didn't and by the end I wished I hadn't wasted my time or money on the DVD.  Also, I noticed when the credits were rolling that there were an awful lot of French names so I guessed it was a 'made in Canada' film and I was right.  A lot of TV movies are Canadian productions and this movie certainly was worse than some of those mediocre movies although presumably it was actually released in cinemas.  I'm only giving it 2 stars for Diane Kruger's acting and for the music.  Otherwise I'd give it a big fat ZERO if I could.",0,0,0,0

R1GQ4ZC5N3TEKN,"I've read practically everything Joel C. Rosenberg has written, and I've read every fiction work of his and up until now I have loved every word.This one, however, seems very contrived.  There are 100 chapters prior to the epilogue. The ending was pathetically brief.  Most of the first half seems to be argumentative discussions between the main character, JB and his brother, Matt, or JB pining over his unrequited love.The story line of the attacks in DC and elsewhere, the investigation, the finding of where the stolen WWII Howitzers came from, are all completely implausible, unlike the rest of Rosenberg's writings.I got confused in the Epilogue when the First Person changed from JB to his brother.  Fortunately the Epilogue was only about 300-500 words, so by the end of it, it was all clear.So, in this story, we go through about six hours of reading 90% boring nits about how JB feels and thinks about this and that.  There is about 9% leading us to the end of the story, and the less than 1% that brings us to the conclusion.  Fewer than 1000 words describes the final climatic ending, and it was, well, very anti-climatic.I hope Rosenberg's new fictional series will be better than this.One reviewer wrote that it seems the ending was written, and then the rest of the book was written in an attempt to justify the end.  My opinion is Rosenberg was under a deadline to finish this novel, and was probably pretty busy doing a lot of other things, and this got lost in the pile of work. It reads like he received an email one day saying his book was due, and he didn't really have the time he needed any more to flesh it out like he did his other works, including the previous two episodes of this series.I had such high hopes for a thrilling plausible ending only to find a boring deus ex machina finish.Sorry Mr. R.

It is a match and price is the best.I received them, and use the first one almost immediately. Printer displayed ""Cartridge problem, see user guide for detail"". No resolution but re-installing a couple times; clean the circuit board (not the printer head, I follow the instruction) and re-boot the printer several times. No good, open the second one, this time, printer displayed ""Cartridge not compactable"".Finally gave up; filed a claim to return. Yes, they replied wih a RMA# but no shipping label.What? These are defective items, not I changed my mind or something, why I need to pay for a shipback for something that are not working?A terrible experience on the purchase.

R2WAL65HCFCUEI,"Many positive reviews of the movie completely ignore the central plot, characters, and their relationships to praise the interesting portrayal of the Ulster Irish backdrop. If that is one's interest, there are better ways to explore the topic than through this particular dour play pitting the heroine's perversity against tradition, convention and the cultural straightjackets that come with religion--Protestant or Catholic. That main story is a heavy-handed, unengaging take spooled out at a plodding pace that leaves viewers with little to appreciate other than the scenery and backdrop, which is probably why even the positive reviews tend to praise the also-ran elements rather than the front runners and main focus. Yes, the actors gave strong performances, but it was the kind of obvious performance art produced to make a capital-S ""Statement,"" not the sort of work where you lose yourself in the time and place portrayed and visit with convincing characters so well played you forget it's just a good act. There are many better ways to spend the time it takes to watch this clunker, so I suggest finding one.",0,0,1,1
RF4DEL5W7UVTO,"In search of some new music to listen to, I borrowed a couple of CD's from a Co-worker.  One of the CD's I grabbed was ""A Fever You Can't Sweat Out"". I'd heard some good things about Panic! At The Disco and I was completely ready to like this album; until I listened to it.  What I heard didn't impress me.  These guys are basically a pop-punk/emo fusion with a dance beat.  Someone else who posted a review here mentioned their use of instruments that don't appear in the genre often, and that is true... but I somehow suspect that has more to do with the producer than the band.  The last song on the album was the most interesting one, but it almost reminded me of ""Mr. Bungle""-lite; genre changing just for the sake of it.  From the looks of the comments here I'm pretty well outside the target demographic for this album, so that might explain my dislike of it.

R2F6LX3FEVUWTU,"I'll save any spoiler comments for the end so anyone can read most of this. As others have mentioned this book is simply another retelling of what Brett has already written in book one, however at least in book two, the plot moved forward somewhat with the introduction of mind demons and invasion of the north. Forget about that in book 3. There are maybe 30 pages (and that's being generous) of plot in the entire 650 page novel.  Its obvious Peter V Brett is just padding page count to charge for more novels rather than just writing what story he has - it makes one wonder if the author really has any story beyond book one since all he can seemingly do is retell book one over and over again.. But the lack of plot is really only the beginning of the awful that is this book.In Book one, I was bothered by Peter V Brett's tendency to write female characters whose only important character attribute seemingly is their breast size, and their only emotional/psychological motivation and purpose is to be sex objects for the male characters. But I chalked it up to it being his first novel and being pressured by an editor to appeal to the all-important 14 year-old-boy demographic.In book two he at least spent about 75% of the book mostly avoiding misogyny. Well in book 3, glorifying misogyny seems to be the entire purpose of the novel. If his female characters are not seducing, screwing or being raped, or pining to be seduced, screwed or raped, then they're not doing much at all. Women who appear in only a single scene and aren't important enough to even get a character name still get detailed descriptions of their breasts/bodies. Leesha now gets headaches that, you guessed it, only a good screw can cure. Even the ""non"" pretty girl, Wanda Cutter's only psychological drive is that she wants to find a man. Near the end Leesha tells Jardir he doesn't ""own"" women, which is ironic because the author has spent the entire novel sexualizing and reducing women to objects. Congrats on furthering the misogyny stereotype in fantasy novels Mr. Brett!And just when you think it can't get any lower, then there's the sexualizing of underage girls - want to read an eroticized account of an underage virgin being ceremonially violated by a piece of marble - well hey, this is the book for you! How about 12-13 year-olds learning how to please men? Yep got that too. Or Rojer's two underage brides whom Brett not only has starring in explicit sex scenes, but spends time vividly describing their bodies in pretty much every scene, after all they can't go outside and sing if they're not wearing their nighties...The author and publisher ought to be ashamed to have this kind of crap in their name.Now for spoilers about what little plot there is -- for those who have wasted their time on this series and hopefully won't waste any more of it:In book one, Arlen explored and struggled for each new piece of info that could help people, but now that he's mind-melded with a mind demon, he just knows things whenever the author needs him to know them. Its the worst kind of expository plot device and there's no sense of accomplishment in anything he does. He learns nothing in book 3 until he again fights a mind-demon near the end and shares his thoughts - yes, its the exact same plot point as the end of book 2.The pressing concern for everyone in this novel is the ""epic"" battle for Cutter's Hollow looming on the next new moon, so you'd think Arlen's book of ancient technological siege weapons might be important, in a city preparing for a demon-siege but nope, ""Ye Old Weapons"" book gets one sentence as Arlen gives it to Leesha and then he tells her to ignore it - which makes sense because why bother giving Leesha the ability to do research, make discoveries and participate in driving the plot when instead she can worry about a pregnancy and finding new men to sleep with. And its totally logical that the ""terrifying"" weapons tech is so terrifying that everyone being killed by demons is a better solution than using the tech - that makes sense.You'd also think that if Arlen had a hidden cache of, say other weapons he recovered from Anoch Sun, he'd retrieve them and give them to the Hollowers before the battle, especially since Arlen can teleport around the world - but nope, he doesn't even think of them until after the ""battle"" is over.Leesha at one point wishes she had more demon bones to enhance weapons for the Hollowers - gee, if only they were, I don't know, killing demons on a nightly basis, and making piles of the bodies....but she never thinks of this because she's too busy screwing the Duke who happened to be the only male character around not already schtupping someone else at the moment.Late in the book, Arlen sneaks into Jardir's camp... to deliver a letter. I kid you not, talk about climactic... And then finally, in the last 10-20 pages we get the only actual advancement of the plot with a fight between Arlen & Jardir. Except it is weakly written, feels rushed, and just continues to regurgitate the same info we've read for the last two books and concludes with them jumping over a cliff where Arlen Teleports away at the last moment and Jardir crunches into the ground which is the only thing keeping it from literally being a ""cliff-hanger"".If all the misogyny were cut out, perhaps this series would still be worth reading because that battle would have happened in the first 25% of the book and the story could have actually advanced from there, but it didn't. I suggest everyone do themselves a favor and stick to people like Sanderson, Rothfuss, Sapkowski, Weeks, Hobb, or some other author who isn't trying to pad page counts to sell more novels, whose novels contain more plot than a fortune cookie, and also don't glorify misogyny and the treatment of women as pieces of meat.",0,0,0,0

R3W2FAGB2CMQHC,"""Tipping the Velvet"" is in some ways a very traditional novel. In line with its Victorian setting, its structure is close to that of the nineteenth-century ""Bildungsroman"", a German term that literally means ""novel of education"" but which is perhaps better translated as ""novel of character-formation"". A young woman travels to London from the small provincial town where she has spent her childhood, in search of fame and fortune. After a series of adventures and highs and lows of fortune she eventually finds happiness with her true love. In a nod to Dickens the heroine, Nancy Astley, comes from the North Kent region which was the setting for several of his novels, most famously ""Great Expectations"". Nancy's home town, Whitstable, is situated roughly half-way between Chatham, where Dickens spent much of his own boyhood, and Broadstairs, where he owned a home as an adult.In another sense, of course, the novel is shockingly modern. It deals with a subject- London's  gay and lesbian underworld-  which was forbidden to mainstream nineteenth-century novelists and which could only have been dealt with through the medium of clandestine erotica. The teenage Nancy is fascinated with the world of the theatre and falls in love with Kitty Butler, a star of the music hall. Kitty takes Nancy under her wing, first as her partner in her stage-act and later as her lover. After Kitty deserts her to marry a man, Nancy goes through a number of reverses of fortune, including impersonating a boy in order to make a living as a male prostitute, being the plaything of Diana, a wealthy lesbian, and finally finding happiness with Florence, an idealistic East End Socialist.The book is divided into three parts, the first dealing with Nancy's life with Kitty, the second with her life on the streets and with Diana and the third with her life with  Florence. Of the three, the first was by far the best;  the chapters dealing with Nancy's realisation of her sexual orientation and of her growing feelings for Kitty were sensitively handled and well done. Unfortunately, the plot goes rapidly downhill after Nancy and Kitty split up. Nancy's decision to go on the streets as a ""male"" prostitute is never made remotely plausible. Even if she has recently been crossed in love, this would be a bizarre thing for any woman to do, and even more so for a lesbian who dislikes the idea of sexual relations with men. There were plenty of alternatives open to Nancy; she could have  tried to continue her stage career as a solo performer or, if this was unattractive to her, returned to her family in Whitstable. The chapters dealing with the time that Nancy spends as the lover of the cruel and capricious Diana struck me as being much closer to sado-masochistic fantasy than to serious historical writing Diana herself is too much of a caricature to be credible, partly strict dominatrix and partly a female version of the wicked Squire Jasper from a melodrama.The book's final part, dealing with Nancy's relationship with Florence, was rather dull and made for a disappointing ending. The author seems to be sympathetic to the political Left, and obviously regarded Florence as the book's true heroine. Unfortunately, Ms Waters does not have the knack of making morally good characters interesting; Florence is so impossibly noble and saintly as to be completely colourless. Her equally idealised brother Ralph is also equally colourless, as well as a bit sexless; the author's ideal man seems to be one who is nominally heterosexual but who has little interest in or success with women. Florence and Ralph are too good to be true whereas Diana is too bad to be true.One feature of the  book is the frequent wordplay, punning on the differences between modern and Victorian sexual slang. The title is an archaic term for a sex act, and we learn that a lesbian in the 1890s was a ""tom"" whereas an effeminate gay man was a ""mary-anne"". I doubt if I have ever read a novel that makes such frequent use of the word ""gay"", not in its modern sense which did not exist before the mid twentieth century, but in both its original sense of ""cheerful"" or ""colourful"" and in its nineteenth-century slang sense of ""engaged in prostitution"". Nancy is made a heavy smoker, so as to allow Ms Waters maximum opportunity to use the word ""fag"". Even the heroine's Christian name was presumably chosen because of its association with homosexual men. This wordplay always seemed rather too knowing and quickly became tiresome.This, and another of Sarah Waters's novels, have recently been serialised on British television; presumably the BBC thought that they would be popular with two separate audiences, the ""lad's mag"" brigade hoping to see two actresses in bed together and the lovers of historical drama who might accept them as an acceptable substitute for Dickens or Jane Austen. The novel also seems to have been written for this dual audience, coming across as an odd mixture of highbrow, literary historical fiction and lowbrow pornography. (There are numerous erotic passages, far more than there would be in most mainstream novels dealing with heterosexual love). It succeeds more on the second level than on the first.",0,0,0,0
R38ECMIKBBQUS7,"I picked up the book, and got about what I expected.  Certainly, it is not reasonable to expect anyone to be Frank Herbert, and trying to write in the Dune universe is a daunting task.So I accepted that the characters weren't as subtle, the plans within plans ad infinitum weren't there, and there was more fluff that made the book while as long as a Dune offering, just not as satisfying.  On the upside, the borderline pretentious posing and glee at one's own subtlety was missing as well.  That could grate at times.And the epic events depicted somehow just weren't as epic.  A hollow shell, without the abliity to draw in.  Perhaps it was the overt displays, the way most things were on the surface, rather than hinted at in a well turned sentence.Consider:  In Dune, the Duke and Jessica hardly seemed to display and tension between themselves (as there are hardly any discussions between themselves), but by secondary discussions and inference, the tension is just as strong as if pages of prose had been devoted to building it.The whole thing was ""Dune lite"", as it were.There were contradictions, from the death of the Old Duke, to the stretch for Elrood's chaumurky death and Baron Harkonnen being thin to start with.  I'd discuss, but it would be too much of a spoiler.Then, as I was nearing the end, ready to go and write a passing review, I found something I could not countenance.

RGDMBGHQTBSXT,"My god this was such a horrible stapler.  I was in the market for a heavy duty stapler because the higher-ups at my job don't provide the best staplers for their employees and I decided to just get one myself.  The kind of job I have at work involves stapling papers all the time....I could use a stapler up to 60 times or more per day and that takes a toll on a regular office stapler.  Sometimes I would staple thick stacks but mostly thin stacks.  After two years at the place where I work, I've already broken two staplers and I knew it was only a matter of time before they made me buy my own stapler.  So I decided to do it right after I broke my second one.  While the reviews for this product were mostly positive with the exception of one other reviewer, unfortunately I have to side with that lone review that gave this product a one star rating.  It jammed almost every time I tried to use it.  Then after I got it to work, it refused to push the next staple forward.  Then I took out the 1/4"" inch staples and put in a 3/8"" inch and I still got the same problems.  The stapler did work with 15/16"" staples without jams but then the staples would protrude back up..which means you could accidentally stab yourself!  Plus I didn't have anything thick enough that would require a 15/16"" staple.  This stapler was marketed being able to staple anything from 2-220 sheets but I can tell you right off the bat that's not true.  It's possible that this stapler requires special staples like the Stanley Bostitch EZ Squeeze 130 (Which I wound up replacing this garbage with) but it never specified that it did unlike the Bostitch 130.  For the record I did find Rapid Staples but at that point I was so disgusted with this stapler I just chucked it instead of returning it.

R1JUYNX2EX0JKI,"Readers of established fantasy can skip this one, as mentioned in other reviews.  As an introduction to the genre, I'd much rather see a new reader steered in the direction of an established author, as this series would be a mediocre start.I first intended to review Eragon without having read the second book, but it became necessary as the second book is significantly different from, and better than, the first.  My unorthodox suggestion is for you to skip Eragon and go right to Eldest - the summary of Eragon at the beginning of Eldest is much better than wading through the book itself, and you can always go back later and read it to find out about the Brom character and the hatching of Saphira if you are still interested by the end of Eldest.Having said that, here is my review of Eragon.  My personal taste in fantasy is for a well-crafted epic and/or really new and different fantasy worlds peopled by interesting races, and at least one unforgettable character.  I find Eragon to be an odd book to review; ultimately I approached it from two angles - that of a regular fantasy novel/start of a trilogy, and as the debut product of a very young author.  From the fantasy viewpoint, it is an adequate but not original or memorable story, and readers of Tolkien, LeGuin, and Anne McCaffrey's dragon series will not find any surprises in the types of creatures or concepts that make up Alagaesia.  However, this is an admirable first effort for a teenager who clearly possesses enthusiasm for his topic and a formidable vocabulary.  At times it seems as if he's being paid to write by the word and wants to show how many he knows; but in this age of crumbling literacy I have to applaud his interest in writing and the English language.  His author's note at the end is as interesting as the body of the book, as it gives you a nice glimpse of the mind/personality behind the narration.  I would rate the effort a 4 out of 5 but the originality and execution of the story a 1 of 5, so I gave it two stars.My main two main problems are the lack of originality, and the character of Eragon.  He is a little too good, too fast, at everything he learns or attempts, becoming the equal of, or surpassing, the best practitioners of swordsmanship and magic in the land - much to the stunned and profuse admiration of whoever is handy.  That he is intended to be special is clear, but there's no particular aura of humility, craftiness or nobility that clings to him, and his rapid progress from poor illiterate farm boy to heroic prodigy is just a little too convenient.  He doesn't even have much of a personality beyond being a cocky average teenager.  If this is supposed to be part of his ultimate growth as a character, the author gives no hint that we are to take Eragon's exploits with a grain of salt and wait for him to grow up.  By the end of the book he has avoided any sort of major character-forming hardship and gone right to being the center of everyone's hopes and attention, and after about half a year of time and at age 16, is apparently master of everything he touches.  Aside from the mystery of Eragon's parentage (which will no doubt turn out to be impressive), the author attempts to justify Eragon's talents by explaining that those who become dragon riders are automatically better at everything than everyone else, but it doesn't really hold water.I also wish for a little more personality and a distinctly different/alien thought process from Saphira, who most of the time sounds like an indulgent human mother.  She jumps incoherently between the wisdom of dragon race memory, caring protector and uppity teenager.The most intriguing character is Murtagh, and I look forward to his development.  There are also strong characters among the Varda and Dwarves (Ajihad, Nesuada, Orik and Hrothgar in particular) who seem to have something to offer.  I am hoping that Arya has a lot more dimension to be revealed, because at this point she just seems to be a generic strong, beautiful, fey elf maiden.  We're told she is very important but for now I'm not quite quaking in her presence.The first 200 pages introduce the world of Alagaesia and the characters.  Facts presented for the reader's benefit, and justification for decisions made, are divulged by a lot of awkward, methodical dialogue that slows down the narrative.  After this, the action picks up and moves along.  The long tedium of a carefully explained cross-country trek, with all hell exploding loose at the eleventh hour of the story is a bit jarring, and once again, Eragon's feats at the end of the book are just beyond belief.  If one reads the first chapter of Eldest which is provided at the end of the book, the author somewhat back-peddles and deconstructs the prodigious achievement by indicating that it was accomplished ""partly by luck"".I had high expectations of Eragon, given the handsome presentation of the hardcover books and the outcry of fans about how bad the movie was (I have avoided seeing it until I could read it first).  After reading the book, I have to conclude that either the movie was truly a disaster, or the fans were over-protective of the material.In a nutshell, if you are wavering on whether or not to read this book, see if the library has a copy before you buy it.",0,0,0,0

R1X0XXYQLQOTDX,"Terrible piece of writing, a sign of the end times for good fantasy fiction - well, if you're a pessimist.  If you're an optimist, than the book is a big, stinky publishing fart that will hopefully never repeat itself.  Unfortunately, I see that the third is well on its way.  I bothered to read the first two and let me say that that was more a sign of my sheer stubbornness than it was a sign that the book actually deserved reading.  I literally had to sit myself down and refuse to get up until 50 pages were read to finish.  I think it was morbid curiosity.  What's got so many people actually spending money on it?  I'd have to go with the formula for the story, as Star Wars meets Lord of the Rings with some Narnia and other stuff mixed in, for the why.Still, great working formula or not, the book just sucks in a fanfiction type way.  I'm not saying fanfiction is necessarily bad, but it should never be formally published.  Changing names and scenes doesn't count.  Save yourself the time and effort, and listen to the good people trying to save you money and time.  Go get a real book.",0,0,0,0
R1QYC0L3542G7T,"Ok, I wanted to respond to a reviewer who said that the only people who buy Britney's albums are guys who think she's hot.  That is completely wrong.  Britney constantly taking off her clothes may have gotten her attention from men, but the VAST majority of consumers who bought her cd's were GIRLS!!!! Think about it, how many straight guys do you know with a Britney Spears CD???  NADA. BUT, look through a guys' cd case and here are some of the women you may see....Ella Fitzgerald, Garbage, Tracy Chapman, Norah Jones, Alicia, Alison Kraus, etc. These are just some of the cds I have found when looking through the cd cases of my boyfriend and guy friends. This shows that while a ""hot body"" and good looks(although Britney sure hasn't been looking too hot walking out of public restrooms with bare feet and much needed acne medication, just shows what makeup and hours of airbrushing can do!) might get shallow, short-lived attention from guys, it sure as hell ain't going to get you respect or a career from them.  No, the ones who have been fueling this trashy, talentless career have been girls, and it needs to stop.  By dressing in sluttly clothes and partaking in obnoxious, hypocritical behavior-the tacky, overhyped Madonna Kiss, the 24 hour marriage and divorce, the man-stealing, buying own engagement ring, posing practically nude for countless mags, the ""I'm a virgin, oh wait, oops, I'm not!"" Britney has betrayed and isolated her fan base, young girls.  Look, I don't have a problem with Cortney Love acting trashy, she never set up herself as being innocent and her fan base hasn't been young girls.  But Britney has deceived millions....she presented herself as this virgin/whore who teased but was always a ""good girl,"" and once she made her money, she abandoned her fans and became the slut that she is.So I am begging the women out there who are fueling her career....PLEASE PLEASE STOP!!!!!!!!! There are so many reviews out there that are like, ""I don't like Britney, she's a bad person, but buy this cd!"" First of all, most of these songs are on her other cds, except for three that aren't that good. Secondly, people have to take a moral stand every once in a while, and realize that Britney Spears has been TERRIBLE for women AND the music industry.  To say that she is a ""great"" performer is an exaggeration.  One of my friends is a professional dancer, and she told me that Britney's not even that great a dancer, that she uses really simple moves that she puts a lot of ""effort"" into so that they look really complicated. If you want to see a great pop performer by a talented female singer, buy Madonna's ""Truth or Dare."" But bail out on Britney, download her songs if you must, but PLEASE DON'T buy this CD.  It's time to put an end to this immoral, brainless bimbo.",0,0,0,0

RS7OH9GPLXMI2,"The confirmation that women are now working together and helping one another to succeed was great and encouraging to me as a young professional woman working in a male-dominated field. My work girlfriends and I get together for cocktails at least once a month and this book really emphasized the importance of getting together and supporting each other both personally and professionally.The reason for only 2 stars is because I thought there was way too much summary. There was more telling rather than showing, and that made it easy to lost interest quickly. The book also got a little redundant - different versions of the same idea hashed out chapter after chapter.Overall, I did find the book to be inspiring and was glad to have read it. I just think that it could have either been shortened into an article or more focused on one or two women and their struggle which would have allowed it to be more emotionally compelling and moving.Love the book title!",0,0,0,0

RQR7UJCDK2JML,"I have heard from various sources that, although many of the ideas in Eragon are copied from other authors, it is possiuble to enjoy Paolini's work at face value. Unfortunately, I found myself unable to do so. I don't mean to sound like the average Paolini-hater (I would have given this book one star if I was), so I'll list several reasons as to why I had trouble with this book.1. The characters did not seem real to me. I found Eragon himself to be petulant and annoying; on top of his frequent narcalepsy there were unsettling characterizations. When he felt grief I felt indifference. He was not humorous or realistically courageous in any way. He made mistakes because Paolini made him make mistakes. I kept waiting for Eragon to come into his own, but he remained nothing more than a window through which we were able to view this book's not-so-terribly-original world.2. The dialouge. In what world- real or imagined- do people talk like this? What time period was the author trying to convey to his readers? In one line, I was reading casual, modern dialouge... and in the next paragraph I was met with medival jargon that seemed (to me) forced.3. The borrowing. Yes, I know i said I tried to take this book at face value. But the similarities of names (Paolini's Vanilor and Eridor to Tolkien's Valinor and Eraidor) astounded me. Had it happened only three or four times I wouldn't have thought twice about it. But if you browse some of the other reviews on Amazon, you'll see how many of Paolini's names are 'borrowed' from other works. I'm asking you to browse for two reasons: 1. So that you will see I am far from alone in this opinion, and 2. becuase i don't have the time to list the dozens (yes, dozens) of both linguistic and plot-related similarities between this and other works of the fantasy genre.Am I being too harsh? Absolutely not. Any published author, regardless of his or her age, opens himself or herself up to both positive and negative critisism the second the work in question hits the shelves. And how would I know what it's like to write a book at such a young age?The answer to this is quite simple. I am a sixteen year old high school junior and I have (gasp) written a book. Eragon was written for teenagers and when i first read it at age 14 I had exactly the same opinion of it as I do now. I am, supposedly, the target market of this book. If you must read Eragon, take advantage of your public library... or, if this book is for your children, buy instead Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card or the His Dark Materials trilogy by Phillip Pullman. Both are quality, thought-provoking works with a perfect blend of originality and likeable characters.",0,0,0,0
R3GWUON6MQG7O1,"I have several issues with this specific product:1. The vinyl isn’t “pure”/“clean”. I’ve found many little black flecks that protrude between the vinyl and the backing wax paper it comes with. This has resulted in a huge waste of product because I have to cut off and throw away any “impure” vinyl.2. The vinyl bubbles easily. Don’t let the roll have any weight on it unless you want giant bubbles to appear throughout the roll! I had to throw away a half used roll because of this. More waste!3. The vinyl requires a consistently heavy hand to lay it nicely. If you release too much, you will get small annoying bubbles.To sum it up, don’t be a silly potato and order  three rolls of (any) product before testing it out. (Oops.)I give this product 2/5 stars because of the waste I’ve dealt with due to the quality of the product.

I was playing this cd while driving around town, and at some points I said out loud, ""You've got to be kidding.""  Sorry, if you are a Diana Krall fan, and I know they are legion, this cd is very different from what you are used to hearing from her.

R2FEWCDQIUQV3E,"On one hand I could hope that this is just one bad novel.  However it seem clear that with each Scarpetta novel, Patricia Cornwell gets more and more long-winded with all the associated information and forgets she is writing a mystery/thriller novel.  It's not just her fault - many authours so this with recurring characters.Having read all the Scarpetta novels, I took my time getting to this one.  My wife said it was not worth reading and I should have taken her word for that.  But I did delay.  I wish I had delayed longer.Not only is the ending the worst I've read in a very long time but things happen in the novel that just don't make sense:*Lucy murders Rocco.  That's justifiable since he's bad.  Nothing self defense about this.  Then afterward wonders if murdering him was right considering she did confirm the details that were in the one short letter she recieved - that might or might not have come from who she thought it was.  (Turns out it didn't come from him.)  And then, almost the first chance she has, she admits it to her lawyer.  ANd then minutes later to Kay.  Hello...  you murdered someone.  You don't go blabbing about it.*For better or for worse, Rocco is Marino's son.  You'd think that would count for at least some double checking.*Marino is going downhill fast.  I was hoping he'd double over with a heart attack as it appears he might be at one point.  In this novel he has no redeaming features nor any appreciable skills.  In fact I don't think he does anything useful in this novel.*Benton comes back.  Many reviews try to avoid saying this but he's back on page 50 so it's not a big secret.  He cold bloodly plans and murders three people.  To say nothing of the fact that he's set up his friends to also do illegal acts including murder.*The ending is just so bad.  We have pages of character development/discussion about Bev and Jay Talley but her death comes in a few paragraphs and we have nothing on his end but a one-sentence description.  There was more space given to describing Lucy's helicopter than to the logical endings in this book.  Hell we have 4-5 pages of Marion walking out on Trixie and 2-3 pages of Kay and Benton reunion.*The single worst point in the book is Chapter 46 when Lucy and Rudy are driving away from the murder and Lucy starts to ""deeply kisses his fingers, his knuckles, his palm...and slides the other inside her black linen blouse...""  I kept reading expecting to find out that we had dopplegangers or something.  But no...there's a passing reference to things you do as a release from such harrowing experiences but this example makes no sense.  It'd be like James Bond feeling up his male contact after his latest murder.  We all know Cornwell was married for 10 years prior to realizing she was Lesbian but we have no history of this with Lucy.  Lucy's been Lesbian since almost the first - this behaviour makes absolutely no sense.So this is the last Scarpetta novel I'll buy.  I might read the next one if I can get it from the library but it has to be much better for me to even finish it.Hopefully the next novel will wrap up any loose ends and the Scarpetta characters put to a rest.  Then maybe in 10 years Cornwell can come back fresh and with a novel to rival her first ones.",0,0,0,0

R3GMX71T808KFK,I bought the Palm TX because my Tungston wouldn't hold a charge any longer. I have been a long time user of Palm ad thought that the TX might have some good features.

A two hour wait for Palm tech support (when the voice said only a five minute wait) didn't help my mood much.  Tech support told me what I already knew--the product was defective. I returned it to Amazon and asked for a replacement hoping to have a different experience. This time the Palm charged but after it charged the screen went blank.  Again tech support gave the same advice--which I already knew and finally told me to just charge it for 24 more hours (of course I knew that wouldn't make much difference) so now after another 24 hour charge I am returning the TX to Amazon and asking for a refund.

Now cyan was OUT and black only 100 pages left! So since I can't print as long as ANY cartridge is out of ink I HAD to replace the cyan.  Replaced it and went back in to check in levels again.

There is plenty of over the top kills, pointless characters who are there only to die the most graphic of deaths, and bad very bad dialog.  Keene is the worst at dialog.  What I hate most about his dialog is when he takes white characters and makes them all hip hop and urban sterotypes.  It is just the worst.  He can not pull it off.All the characters suck.  You will not like one of them but Levi, and as I said he is not written as good as before.  The Iraq veteran character with his suicidal exgirlfriend and her aggravating brother and his friends will just make you puke.  Most characters in this book which for a town that everybody keeps saying is so dead has plenty of people in it are there just to die.  As I have stated in other reviews of Keenes books there will be lots of gore and at least one guy getting his pecker ripped off and or shoved into his mouth. So it is just page after page of bad dialog, gore, and swearing that leads to a happy ending where most the main players win, are happy and ride off into the sunset.  Do yourself a favor and skip this garbage.",0,0,0,0
R3BYSQO8T9RR17,"THE DREAM LOVER, by Elizabeth Berg.  I've been a fan of Elizabeth Berg's work ever since I read  Talk Before Sleep: A Novel , which I guess has been quite a few years ago now. Enjoyed at least a half dozen of her early books, all a cut or two above the usual chick-lit genre. But after that her work took on a kind of sameness and I stopped reading her. When I read about this new book, a fictionalized life of French author George Sand, it sounded rather interesting, historical fiction representing a distinct departure for Berg.I should probably admit I have never read anything by George Sand, but knew a little about her. Berg tries to get inside Sand's head and heart, using a first person narrator. For me it worked and it didn't work. The voice seemed authentic enough, I suppose. Maybe it was that 19th century setting and the semi-stilted period dialogue that didn't quite work. Whatever it was, I just never could bring myself to care much about Aurore Dupin aka George Sand, with her unhappy childhood and marriage and her 'scandalous lifestyle.' And even all those famous personages of the era (Flaubert, Liszt, Delacroix, Chopin, etc.) who should have made the story more interesting fell kind of flat, with the exception perhaps of the actress, Marie Dorval. For the most part they remained two-dimensional. Okay, maybe they were all a part of Sand's life, but it still read like a lot of name-dropping from two hundred years ago. Yeah, Sand was probably bisexual, and often acted and dressed like a man. But I already knew that. And yes, it's undoubtedly true that women were treated like chattel, and Sand bucked that. She put on trousers and smoked cigars, had affairs, and got her books published and got famous. It's all in there. In the end, I just didn't CARE about this woman.I won't say it's a bad book, but I don't think it was a very good one either. All that research kept showing through, sometimes in a rather tiresome and boring way. I suspect, however, that THE DREAM LOVER will be another best seller for Berg, because she does have her legions of fans. (I was one of them.) What I wonder is how many of the people who buy the book will actually finish reading it. I did read the whole thing, but I didn't particularly enjoy it, and was glad to be done with it. Maybe women who like historical 'romance' novels will like it. Me? Nope. Won't recommend it. (two and a half stars)- Tim Bazzett, author of the memoir, BOOKLOVER",0,0,0,0

R1ERLLWWYV0YH6,"I watched Hayley Pomroy give wonderful promises and make wonderful claims on my local PBS station, and thought, heck, it must work.  I decided to buy the book after reading the claims online, and dozens upon dozens of reviews and some blogs.  I did EVERYTHING I could to do the diet completely right – I read the book from start to finish first, bought the right groceries ($$$!), I journaled (at least the first two weeks), I even took Week 1 as vacation from work – so I could focus on doing EVERYTHING right, cooking and freezing tons of food, to set myself up for success.What a disappointment.  After two weeks I was down a whopping 4 ½ pounds.  You might think, wow, that’s good…. But after reading the book and the promises Hayley made, it was utter failure.  For instance, she has chapters where she specifically walks you through what to expect each of the four different weeks.  When describing week three, she writes, “You’re down 10, maybe 14 pounds [by now]….” (pg. 144) and then describing life after the 28-day diet, she writes, “”If you had much more than 20 pounds to lose, you probably aren’t there yet…” (page 166).  So….that kind of leads a person to expect that 20 pounds is the norm…if not the minimum… doesn’t it??As I wrote before, I set myself up for success in every way I could.  My family was so supportive – my husband did what he could to cook according to my diet (when he happened to be making supper).  After finishing the first two weeks and feeling frustrated, he could tell it, and let me sob for 5 minutes (was that the “deep breathing” I was supposed to do in Phase 3??”).  I ate not so much as an Oreo cookie.  I sat and ate salad and sesame seeds in a restaurant – twice – while my family enjoyed a full-on pizza buffet.  I avoided so much as one French fry when driving through McDonald’s after soccer.  I was, for the most part, a social hermit and missed out on parties, etc. to ensure that I stayed on track.  At the end of the month, I lost a whopping 6 pounds…but a couple of those have already come back, even though I have changed the way I eat (I’m eating in “Phase 3” for the most part; I’ve introduced some wheat back in to my diet, and just a bit of dairy – mostly cheese – no yogurt, no milk, no ice cream).  So much for the ""igniting"" and ""red-hot fire"", etc., etc., that the author promised again and again...Ms. Pomroy, I am not a person to normally call people out….but can you explain this?  I loved the book, loved your prose (you sound like someone I would be friends with…and I’m an aggie too!), you made me a BELIEVER….and I feel like a failure instead.  There are others that have written about their failure / struggle too….WHAT ADVICE DO YOU HAVE for us?  What could we have done differently??",0,0,0,0

RENYVXD76SHCA,"I absolutely loath and hate the fact that I must write this review of a James Herbert book and it's one that I never thought I would have to give.I have loved almost all of his books since he started publishing them. There have been a couple recently that one instantly read and threw away but never one so bad and dud as this.I often wonder if authors should keep resurrecting a character especially if they have been through as much as Ash has in two previous books. Maybe best to let them lie and get the reader wondering. This is definitely the case with this book.I initially got interested in the first few pages and then started to drift and then started to scan, something I have never done with  a Herbert novel before. I wonder if his proof reader did likewise as there are so many mistakes in it that belies the fact that this novel's publishing date kept being put back. Is Delphine a doctor or a psychologist or a psychiatrist? When does a revolver suddenly turn into an automatic? How could Gaddafi be there when the whole world saw him being slayed by his people?Aside from that why bring back rats? Cringingly why on earth does he bring his own  persona into the story with Ash saying 'I hate that bloke who wrote about rats'. At least when Clive Cussler writes himself into a story it is done with some panache and actually adds in some little way to the story. I just thought...oh God whatever next!I had waited and waited like so many other fans, for this book, looking forward to being able to sit down and enjoy a thoroughly tried and tested read. Oh how I was wrong.Sorry James but I feel cheated and sad and also sad for you. This is definitely not nor will ever be a piece of writing that you can be proud of or even want to add your name too. Shame on your publishers for not throwing it back and asking you to cut out at least 50% of it along with half the storyline, the politics, the medical goo that is often incorrect and misleading (as others have pointed out in these reviews ).What saddens me most is wondering if you do write another book, will I bother to read it?I hate to say it but is it time to hang up your pen or go sit somewhere quiet and re read The Fog or the Rats or Survivor or Others, and remember when you were great and actually wrote brilliant novels.",0,0,0,0
R9MZPF2G1I3TN,"Cup holder on the right means very little room for your mouse.  Because of the angle, the second you let go to type, the mouse falls to the bottom of the screen.  The mouse issue was anticipated, so they added a very very uncomfortable lip to stop it from falling off the desktop completely.  This lip hurts to the point where you need a wrist cushion.  Once you add the wrist cushion, the bottom half of the extension is used up and the mouse is now half in the drink hole.  It comes with a FitDesk mousepad which is too big to actually fit on the product it comes with.

If you'd told me this had been written by a young teenager, I'd have believed you. Incredibly plain, clunky descriptive writing, and risible dialogue. I'm no fan of Stephen King, but hell, the guy can write, and comparison with his ability is nothing short of a joke.There's also a nasty whiff of misogyny running through the book, with fairly casual dismissal of rape, and pretty demeaning writing about a number of the minor female characters.

R2NK8Y66KYD1YN,"I liked the premise of this movie, and I loved the title, but the actual film fails to live up to either. A group of friends jump into an RV and decide to travel around Texas and visit the most extreme Halloween haunted house attractions. Filming each location as they walk through the exhibits, they hear about the ""Blue Skeleton"" attraction, a notorious underground haunt that is supposed to be the most extreme experience available.I love going to these Halloween attractions every year, and the idea of a film based on these attractions sounded really cool. Unfortunately ""The Houses October Built"" is just another found footage no-budget, no scares, unimaginative horror film. Even for a lazy genre like found footage, this is a lousy film. Most found footage films just feel like hastily slapped together films using the found footage gimmick to hide the lack of F/X and small budget, but ""Houses"" feels really cheap. What should be a slam dunk, watching the stars walk through the various haunted attractions, falls very flat. The filmmakers don't capture the fun or scares of the attractions filmed, they actually manage to film very little of anything through extremely poor camera work, either it's too shaky, not focused or zoomed in too tight to make out what we are supposed to be looking at.

R3DLZQ87IOMWMP,"Most negative reviewers of this album appear to be people who have no inclination to like it anyway, regardless of its actual content: heavy metal fans, people who have no taste for light rock, and scorned Radiohead fanboys. So, seeing that my rating for this album is as low as it is, you'd expect me to belong to one of the above camps; quite to the contrary, however, I long held ""A Rush of Blood to the Head"" to be one of the best albums I had ever heard, and eagerly anticipated this follow-up. All of the former being said, however, I found ""X&Y"" to be quite possibly the most disappointing artistic accomplishment that I've ever experienced.It's almost impossible to talk about the majority of the tracks on an individual basis, as they so closely resemble one another in their dull, vague lyrics and monotonous, repetitive melodies. More than once, I would often check my CD player to see if I had accidentally hit ""repeat"" and was listening to a previous track. While I will refrain from an exhaustive comparison of the two albums, and thereby expose a bias that I do not have towards wishing this album to sound like the band's former work, ""X&Y"" seems to be attempting to achieve a similar status as ""A Rush"", an album that was melancholy and remorseful while simultaneously being pleasantly retrospective and uplifting. The main difference between the two is that ""X&Y"" is much more depressing and quiet in tone. I would be open to this stylistic feel if it was executed in such a way that was moving and, most importantly, interesting. Instead, the band takes the idea of ""less is more"" to such an extreme that they delude any substance or message that exists in the music. Lyrically, the album is a just a collection of pre-suicidal, clinically depressed anecdotes and generic philosophical ponderings that mirror the emptiness of the narrative. Musically, the music follows suit, coming across as quite bland for all of the band's obvious ambition. Bluntly, the music and the lyrics just...are. Period. Nothing more, nothing less.Of course, that's not to say that every single track on the album follows suit with the aforementioned pattern: there are the stand-out songs that up my overall rating a star. While it does tend to get old, partially due to its being overplayed on the radio and the video subsequently being shown constantly on television, ""Speed of Sound"" is nevertheless a very well-crafted, melodically and lyrically inspiring song in the style of ""Clocks."" Like the band's previous single, its meaning is ambiguous, yet it still manages to soar musically. More impressive is ""Fix You"", the underrated and underplayed second single off of the album. A truly moving tale of the narrator's attempts to console a loved one, the song builds from delicate piano and sincerely soft vocals to a multiple harmony finale featuring the voices of the entire band, complete with a great and memorable guitar riff that perfectly compliments the song's gentle tone. It's certainly not an accident that the sole two good songs from the album became its first two promotional singles; it almost appears as if the record company knew that the other tracks would never sell the album if mainstream audiences heard them on the radio. Of course, then again, they did release the tepid ""Talk"" as the album's third single, the epitome of the nothingness of ""X&Y"", so I could be wrong.Plain and simple, this album is disappointing on an epic level and not worth buying or downloading, even for free. I would recommend getting ""Speed of Sound"" and ""Fix You"" separately and skipping all of the other hollow attempts at songwriting on this bomb.",0,0,0,0

R2LQ262BI0XER8,"I almost didn't bother reviewing this because the other 2-star reviews sum up the book's flaws cogently, but since folks look at the overall review trend I will add a few thoughts.The hook is planted deeply in the first couple chapters which do a marvelous job of setting up the mystery, with well-researched (or at least very convincing) details on how the authorities from the FAA to the CDC would react to the inexplicable ""death"" of an entire jumbo jet.  The promise of a monster story with a deep grounding in the reality of the modern world seems very high for the first half of this book.Yet key parts of the mystery are never fully solved (why no evidence panic or disturbance among the 200-odd passengers?  No explanation emerges from the eventual reveal of the culprit). Even the setup and execution of the solar eclipse (some of the best writing here) is wasted as the event turns out to be of no consequence whatsoever.  And after the promising first half the book quickly degenerates into a standard hack-and-slash monster hunt that we've seen in dozens of other movies and video games.One can only imagine Del Toro was the ""idea man"" here while Hogan did the heavy lifting of writing the prose.  And there are some interesting ideas here, primarily in the anatomical and behavioral details of the zombie-vampire hybrid creatures themselves.  But the kind of mind-blowing creativity in evidence in Del Toro's other work is really not there, and the overarching mythology is poorly thought out and inconsistent.The writing itself also seems weirdly unfinished and unedited with the seams showing more and more as the book goes along -- key information (such as Setrakian's backstory) is presented twice as if the section were fleshed out and moved but never deleted from the original spot.  The research is often transparent rather than integrated into the story -- the book will mention a term or tool and then stop and lapse into Wikipedia mode, directly explaining to the reader what it is.  There are even glaring errors in usage (as when characters try not to ""attract any undo attention"") that you'd expect would be caught somewhere along the line, especially in a big-name, big-budget book.I won't be wasting my time on the sequels to this.",0,0,0,0

R89HPX77JKGJP,"I have over 50 concert DVDs, and have witnessed more than 150 concerts live, so I kind of know the good from the bad. Normally, when a concert is being filmed, they film the crowd noise with mics out in the audience, and record the sound of the band through the sound board. They do this so when you play the DVD through Dolby 5.1 the rear speakers are the crowd noise, obviously so you feel like you are a part of the crowd, and the center and subwoofer are the band sound. Together, it is a nice mix between the two. Not so, in the DVD ""SHOW"" by Matchbox20. I saw the very same set in Raleigh, NC, and it was O.K. live, but we were on the 3rd row from the stage and the sound was not that good. In an amphitheatre, the sound is clearer about 25 rows back and further because you in front of the speakers verses being under them on the third row. So, I couldn't wait for the release of this DVD so I could hear, in clarity, the sound of the band. BUT, the sound is horrible. You cannot understand a single word of the songs unless you know the words to the songs. (Your mind kind of has a way of filling in the blanks when you are at the concert, close to the stage so you don't notice as bad.) Even when the song is over and Rob Thomas (which is a talent) is talking to the crowd, you cannot understand ONE SINGLE WORD! I have other concert DVDs and I would have to rate this one of the worst of all I have for sound and lighting. That is why this is so disappointing.The lighting of the stage and Rob was not good. At times during the concert when the cameras were showing the whole stage, there was no spotlight on Rob and you couldn't find him until they shot him upclose. I have yet to see the Documentary, so I can't comment on that. I hope that part of the DVD set will make it worth the $20.00, the music sure didn't.",0,0,0,0

That's as far as i got because the holes in the frame do not line up so i couldn't go any farther, even though it was clear that there was no need to continue.  The pencil case came misshapen and the frame does not fit together well at all.  I contacted customer service with all the issues to see if they would stand behind their product and fix the problem.  Their only solution was that they could send me a replacement frame bar, while not addressing the pencil case and wheels that don't screw in straight.  I declined that option requesting that they send me an entire new box and a return label to ship this junk back.  They have yet to respond at that point and it's been over a week.

There is simply no way this tray is sturdy enough to support even a small 15"" laptop with the tilt raised. Placing the laptop on the tray causes it to bend, tilting it down on one side. Trying to place your hands on it to type will tip the laptop right off the tray. Avoid this at all costs. I read the reviews and thought I could make it work for the simple application I needed if for. Wrong. It is useless unless you plan on leaving it on a flat surface with the tilt bar down and never touch the laptop once its on the tray.

Started out well, but the pace was so slow it was laughable. To make matter worse I paid 17.99 euros for something that wasn't worth the paper it was written on. So sad when a publisher no longer cares about their author and will publish anything just to make money. I loved all his other books, but if he does publish another one, I'm not buying it.

RBXMEEC0EAKDZ,"First of all, I have to congratulate Mr. Paolini ongetting a novel published, although I heard that his family published it, so maybe if he actually tried to send it to publishers it would have got rejected. I would have.As many people mentioned, a lot of the plot was ripped off from other famous literary novels. I won't go into detail. The whole story was actually very boring and it dragged (well, I'm not sure about the whole story since I never finished because I couldn't stand turning another page of this book.)Also, I have to add something. Mr. Paolini spends an entire paragragh talking about a knot in the wood of the table, but we don't even know how Eragon looks like. Also, in this paragraph (I like ranting about this paragraph) it states that Eragon is looking for answers in this knot on the wood. I mean, why the heck is he looking for answers in the knot. And one more thing. He uses the words excruciating, and asymmetrical in that same paragraph. I'm not saying that our vocabularies are small, but it helps if you always know what the author is talking about...I actually began reading Eragon when I was much younger and I never finished. I decided a few years later, what the heck, I'll give it another try but I didn't even make it as far as last time. The characters are so shallow, and although there is some adequete desription here and there, the writing was dull and flawed.To tell you the truth, I quit quite early on in the story and began just to read the many one-star reviews.I must say, they were more inspirational than the book.I decided",0,0,0,0

R2A2QED6SEB2R9,"First, I need to say that I'm not one of those avid bookreaders who loves lots of wordy description, and a bookthat delves frequently into the personal lives of themain characters. I'm a busy person and I prefer storiesthat are concise and don't waste my time on detailsand filler that contribute little to the main story.In short, I prefer the TV version of these things.I've noticed a lot of book reviews share a commoncomplaint of them being slow and boring, especiallyin the first half or more of the book. So I'm notalone in that view. I think audio book publishersshould take these complaints seriously, and includea 2 Hour version of the audio book for those of uswith limited time or patience. If that were done,I think you would see many more positive audiobookreviews.Although Anna Fields did an ok job on the narration,the narration should have been done by a male, sincethe police investigators were all male. That wouldhave improved the listening experience.As mentioned, the story was slow and boring rightup to the conclusion. The ending was ok and a littleunexpected, so it did have that redeeming value.Still, I won't be trying any more of Donna Leon'sbooks.

R11WKYZD81Q0K4,"I was fooled into thinking this would be a light fun read by the bright color and somewhat whimsical artwork on the cover but as soon as this book began I worried that it was instead going to be about uncomfortable relationships between a few mostly unlikeable characters. I have encountered so many unlikeable characters in books recently and I was right to worry. The main character begins in a minor unlikeable fashion but by the end she was absolutely insufferable. What a mess she made of things. I kept reading because despite not liking the characters the writing was pretty good. Except that is for the description of the supposed setting. The book is set in Dublin but there was little in the description to indicate anything particularly Irish, it really could have been set anywhere.Ugh An unenthusiastic 2.5 Stars and I’m glad it’s over.",0,0,0,0

RXZAND5FLR8WD,"I bought this ink because I visited their booth at the Commowealth Pen Show, but they didn’t allow testing of their inks or pens at the show (go figure) and I didn’t feel they did their job selling the product. So I purchased from amazon. This ink does not work well for pointed nib calligraphy. The ink bleeds terribly even in good 32# paper. I also purchased a black one if this brand and it performs well. It is not water fast at all. I also used it in a medium fountain pen (rotring and Lamy) and was also a poor performer.As you can see from the pictures, I compared 4 inks on the back of a good quality envelope that usually takes calligraphy inks quite well. The black Noodler’s ink is perfect, the Bad Belter Kingfisher was terrible.  The Winsor and Newton had a little bit of feathering and the Pelican was ok. I waited 1 minute and then placed one drop of water. You can see the Kingfisher starts spreading right away while the black one kept its fastness. After 1 minute All but the black ink were ruined.I read great reviews of these inks and now I am confused if they are all different formulations and there’s not a lot of description on the box or the bottle.",0,0,0,0
RBAYGMGCKCEAP,"I was very surprised to read such positive reviews for this new Tamora Pierce series.  I have been a long time fan of her work, but I was very disappointed with Tricksters Choice and Tricksters Queen.  The characters in both of these books are flat and remain static throughout the series.  The plot for both books provides no obstacles for the characters to overcome; this leaves no avenue for Aly, Nawat, or any other characters to develop as individuals.  The reader is never in doubt that everything will work out in the end. Both books also lacked the gritty reality found in the Song of the Lioness series.  Those books allowed the reader to grow with the main character.  We discovered Allana's strengths, weaknesses, and loves right along with her.  We didn't know if she would succeed in her quest, who she would fall in love with, or who she would end up marrying.I guess that I am trying to say that the Trickster series failed because it didn't have any surprises, and because it didn't make me fall in love with the character the way that I am sure we have all fallen in love with Alanna, George, and Jonathan.",0,0,0,0

These had the sealed lamination edge on one of the long edges, making it very difficult to feed into my roller lamination machine which only grabs hold of the pouch when I push it in far enough that my fingers seemed inside the lamination machine.

R3QLZ553AA9EXP,"I give 5 stars for the content of James Allens' awesome book.  I truly appreciate his valuable insights and helpful style of teaching.However, the CD gets 1 star.  I have a wonderful vintage cassette copy of the same material so I thought it would be nice to have a CD that I can listen to in the car.  I ordered the CD in August and received it over three months later due to unavailability.  That's not so much a problem with the CD as with Amazon but I don't hold it against them.  Amazon has always provided very good service so I knew I would get the CD eventually and didn't mind waiting.However, when I finally received the CD it looked suspiciously like a burned copy.  It didn't come with a jewel case or printed cover material of any kind.  It just came in one of those little blank paper CD sleeves that you can buy 50 for $5 at Office Depot.  Also, the CD clearly was not printed by a publishing company or record label of any kind.  There are no copyright imprints, license numbers or indications whatsover of what company has the rights to the material on the CD - nearly every CD does.  Although I thought all of this was a bit odd I still didn't give it too much thought as I was just happy to finally have the coveted material on CD.But... then I put the CD into my laptop for a listen and it sounds AWFUL.  In some places you can barely understand what is being said.  My old cassette copy is very clear and read by a powerful voiced man.  The CD on the other hand sounds EXACTLY like one of those computer simulated robot voices when the words are typed into a translater and out comes RoboRobert.  Then I thought maybe it was a problem with my laptop so I put the CD into my DVD player which also plays CD, and into my stereo CD player - neither one would play the CD at all.I called Amazon to see about returning the CD for a refund and was told that since I was 6 days beyond the 30 days from shipment there was nothing they could do for me - even though I patiently waited over 3 months for the CD.  I also explained that it wasn't just a matter of not being able to understand the CD (or play it at all) but that they should be aware that someone may have shipped me a pirated copy.  Eventually the representative said that she would submit a request for refund but there was no guarantee.  For me it's not so much the money as the principle at this point.If you also bought the CD version of this book and did not have the same issues please leave a review noting that.  James Allens' ""As A Man Thinketh"" is wonderful and I would hate to steer anybody away from purchasing it.  Maybe, and hopefully, my case was an isolated incident.",0,0,0,0

RJKV6M5OKTS69,"I bought the Powershot stapler December, 2012 because of the idea of the seemingly better design.  Actually went thru about 8 boxes of staples (10,000) before it jammed.  Some reviewers did not get even one clip thru without a jam.  No apparent way to unjam.  Fortunately still had my Arrow T50 staple gun that I have had 25+ years (probably >250,000 staples and never a jam) and continued my job (installing insulation).  It looked like the Powershot was an Arrow product, but have seen references to Black & Decker.  It is likely that my old Arrow was made in the USA.  Black & Decker has always impressed me as cheap junk and now that they make everything in China, cheap crap is the best description of their prducts.  I avoid B&D if at all possible, even their Dewalt line if made in China.  The Chinese know how to make cheap crap and dump it on the American market.  I would pay $30 for a quality made in the USA stapler that I can depend on instead of a $15-$20 cheap Chinese crappy stapler that we all know will crap out on us.  It is also highly probably that the staples were also made in China (Arrow brand) so that's a double whammy against quality & dependability. So buy made in the USA if at all possible.

R28JJFFOSFMLMV,"As much as I like Triumph, I can't say this one is worth getting. Very poor video quality and a very bass/muddy and stale sound. Not the worst I've ever seen or heard, but definitely not exciting. Lacks any luster or live excitement. Is was probably good if you were actually there, but this surely doesn't capture anything worth watching twice. I have to say that I've never been impressed with the sound quality of Triumph's live recordings. I was disappointed in Stages too.  But when I actually saw them in concert, I was blown away. They sounded incredible when I was there. A Night Of Triumph Live sounded pretty good though, but they never released it on CD. And for me. Triumph is a trio~ PERIOD. Whether live or in the studio. I really don't want to see a fourth member up there. That's just my opinion. They could easily have used background recordings when playing live to help the sound. Even Rush does it big time. Love Rush too, but they simply cannot reproduce all that music without some background help. Neither could Triumph and most other bands that even have 4 or 5 members. And most live recordings are pumped up when being mixed before they are released to give them some spark,  I can appreciate that they are just being raw and true. But recording it like that and expecting it to be pleasurable to the listener does not work. Again, just my opinion. Again I will say that when you are THERE at the concert, I am eye witness that they were incredible. Anyway to me, this recording sounds horrible, and video is equally bad. I gave it two stars instead of one because it is cool that they reunited and did this. But I would not ever wanted it released if I was them. It kind of spoils what I know they sound like in the studio. Live recordings are never they same of course. But I've heard live recordings that are amazing. Listen to Def Leppard live, or Styx, Foreigner. They're live stuff is better than the studio. Just explosive sound. All I'm saying is: I would love to hear Triumph equal that same kind of incredible explosive live sound as well.",0,0,0,0
R24E9VLZAXT02B,I wouldn't buy this again.1.  The instructions don't tell you how to dump the shavings.  (You squeeze at the right place on the shavings bucket -- that's on upper corners.  There are no markings there -- you have to know.)2.  It doesn't work on normal size round pencils.  The hole is fractionally under 8mm so the 8mm ones (common colored pencils made in metric system countries)  have to be forced in using two hands and it's all but impossible to turn the pencil while sharpening as several reviewers recommend.In theory you could use a rat-tail file to slightly enlarge the cover and inside holes.  In practice the switch that turns the thing on sticks into the inside hole so if you file down there you'll likely disable the thing.Might be okay if all you have is the (smaller)  standard hex leadpencil.,0,0,0,0

R1FZRRJGPUE6L2,"It's difficult to review this movie objectively due to PSH's passing.  In fact, he looks ill throughout the movie, and that probably wasn't acting.  At any rate, I couldn't shake the fact from my mind as I watched it.  There's one particular scene where he rolls out of bed, his hair is pasted back, and he shakily reaches for a tumbler of whiskey that seemed absolutely real.  Of course, it could his fine acting ability.  And it's only in honor of talent that I managed to give this film 2 stars.The plot?  Le Carre used to be good at going deep while keeping up the pace in his books.  Since I didn't read the book on which the movie is based, I can only extrapolate from the film adaptation that he's lost that ability.  I quit reading a few books back when the plots became implausible.  This movie starts out suspenseful, then reaches a plateau where only the early momentum kept me watching--only to discover much of the early action turned out to inconsequential.  One central character annoyingly undergoes a completely radical reversal without much justification.But it was the abrupt ending that astonished me.  All that emotional build up, the anticipation, then it ended like that????Frankly, I'm surprised at all the positive reviews, some calling this the penultimate spy movie.  To me, you could watch the first half hour or so and the last 10 minutes and not miss anything other than the dissolution/dissipation of yet another great Hollywood actor.",0,0,1,1

R2M4SLS7P8O001,"My favorite stapler for many years has been the X-Acto Standup Stapler because it 1) stands up and stays put on my desk, 2) fits well in my hand, 3) is ergonomically the best stapler I have found so far, and 4) weighs less than half of the Bostitch Metal Executive Stand-Up Stapler.  But my X-Acto stapler started jamming after years of use, so based on the multiple 5 star reviews, I ordered this Bostitch stapler from Warehouse Deals.  When I received it, I initially tried to use it with Swingline staples.  It didn't work.  The instructions state to use Bostitch Standard staples so, thinking this was a case of ""operator error"", I ordered a box of those from Amazon.  Stapler STILL DOESN'T WORK, but now too much time has passed to return it.  And just where is the ""staple supply indicator"" that is advertised in the listing??  If it's that 1/16"" diameter hole at the front left side of the ""staple reservoir"" then be still my heart!

R28BXBVKAGYGYC,"As a writer, I really want to like things I read, especially books I am supposed to review. However, I have to be honest and say that I was very disappointed in this book.I believe that a lot of people (myself included!) are suffering from sugar addiction these days I was very excited to get this book for review, and read the author's story about quitting sugar, and follow her 8 week detox program.However, as I began reading, I realized that she makes ALL sugar the enemy, including natural sugars. She speaks of how she was a ""healthy"" eater and that's why she didn't realize at first that she was eating too much sugar. She was eating natural sugars, and sugars from fruits, etc. (fruit, dried fruit, and a teaspoon or 2 of honey was the extent of her sugar in a day's time, according to her) Her no sugar diet eliminates ALL sugars, including completely natural, unprocessed sugars, and fruit. I can't get on board with making fruit the enemy during the program and advocating brown rice syrup and/or processed stevia instead.Which brings me to my next point, her recipes include alternative sweeteners. Although she does speak against artificial sweeteners, she condones the use of some other alternative sweeteners, which are supposedly ""natural,"" but there is still a lot of controversy surrounding them. I was not looking to replace sweeteners with controversial alternatives, especially while cutting out completely natural fruits! I was expecting this book to be something different than what it ended up being. Several of her recipes called for brown rice syrup and processed stevia, which is quite controversial as a sweetener, and not as unprocessed as alternatives like raw honey, which she speaks against.Furthermore, there wasn't really an ""8 week detox program"" There were some thoughts and suggestions broken into 8 sections, but it wasn't really a practical, program to be followed.*I received a review copy of this book.

RY12IJ0IILZ49,"I was intending to purchase this book to learn more about the causes of the housing bubble but before I could do so, my copy of the New York Review of Books (October 27, 2011 edition) arrived and in it I found a review by Jeff Madrick and Frank Portnoy.  You can see this review at:  [...].  Madrick and Portnoy point out several significant flaws in the book by Morgenson and Rosner.  The greatest of these is Morgenson's assertion that ""Fannie"" and ""Freddie"" caused the housing bubble as a result of a political goal of giving mortgages to unqualified low income borrowers.  Madrick and Portnoy point out these claims are unsubstantiated by Morgenson and Rosner, and go on to cite evidence to refute the assertion.  In the conclusion of the book, Morgenson and Rosner  intimate that Wall Street banks may also have contributed to the housing bubble.  Madrick and Portnoy show how Wall Street bankers, mortgage originators and loan processors played the major role in causing the disaster and the role played by Fannie and Freddie, though not innocent, was a minor factor.  In the end, according to the reviewers, Fannie and Freddie were culpable for their greed in chasing ever-growing profits in order to pad their own CEO and executive compensation.  Whether you have read or intend to read ""Reckless Endangerment,""  I suggest you also read Madrick's and Porntoy's review for a proper perspective.",0,0,0,0
R2BICQHFZ6R3YE,"The story presented in this book is fascinating, though I wish the focus was more on the failed system that enabled a delusional individual to raise hundreds of millions of dollars and put patients at risk. Blaming this entire mess on one delusional individual with no credentials or experience is like blaming a raccoon who manages to crash a commercial airliner; even if they did somehow do it - how the hell did it happen? I wanted to hear more about how investors and giants like Walgreens, Safeway, the FDA, etc. screwed the pooch so badly on this that a lying college-drop out and a dotcom bubble moron managed to defraud so many people? Still, very detailed and well investigated story.In terms of narrative though, owch. The author seems stuck somewhere between writing a fictional detective novel for young teens and writing up his real (and impressive) investigative journalism. The amount of cliches, the repeated and over-used descriptions (""big, blue eyes"" and small variations of it being the worst offender). Moreover, the gender and race based stereotyping was a lot to get past. I lost count of how many times the author pointlessly used descriptors to indicate whenever someone wasn't just a white dude. ""The female investigator"", ""the female scientist"", ""the Chinese scientist"", and many more, in places where gender or race was totally irrelevant to the facts of the story. The description of ""ingratiating Indians"" hired by Sonny and other not-so-subtle mentions of their nationality where the only purpose is to paint them as one were also extremely grating, especially as a foreign-national working in the US myself.  The book also could have been 1/3 of the length and contained just as much information. The timeline is messy and confused. The implicit armchair psychology of Holmes' childhood is cringe-worthy crackpot material that even the worst scientist would balk at. The author also seems to have a fairly tenuous grasp on the tech world for someone writing a book on Silicon Valley. He portrays very standard IT security routines as scandalous and Orwellian. Of course you're not allowed plug a random USB into company computers. Of course your IT guy should know what programs you install on them. Of course there are restrictions on access to certain rooms. Granted, Theranos went full 'Big Brother' on its employees, but these were not good examples of that.To explain my 2/5 star rating - he gets full marks for the underlying work and impactful journalism. None of what I have said is to discredit or disclaim any of his findings. But he gets zilch on actually writing a good book, as this was painful to get through.",0,0,0,0

R1EAWYF3ZYYDUC,"After the huge (and much deserved) success of ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"", Guy Richie must have practically been begged to replicate it on a bigger budget and with big-name actors. The resulting movie, ""Snatch"", although just as successful, if not more so, than its forerunner, however, just isn't quite up to the standard set by Richie's first film.The greatest strength of ""Lock, Stock..."" was its script. Richie's many stories of British lowlifes neatly intersected to produce one of the most memorable endings of all time. Richie clearly tried to write a similar script with ""Snatch"" and he succeeds to a certain degree - the multiple storylines are present and they do intersect to form a satisfactory ending, but the plot of ""Snatch"" (which centres around a diamond heist and illegal boxing games) is more convoluted than that of ""Lock, Stock..."" (there are too many storylines, which make the film difficult to follow at times) and the storylines don't tie in quite as neatly. While I still remembered the ending of ""Lock, Stock..."" over 10 years after I first saw it, I am having difficulties remembering the details of the ending of ""Snatch"" two days after watching it. ""Snatch"" is not a bad film and it contains some very funny stand-alone scenes. The cast is fantastic, although perhaps the film could have benefited from containing fewer big-name actors, since very few of the ""stars"" get the opportunity to shine, and in many ways Brad Pitt's character feels like a carry over from his previous movie, ""Fight Club"" (whether this is a good thing or a bad thing is up to you). Nevertheless, I hesitate to recommend this film. If you happen to find it showing one night on late-night television, then it might be worth giving it a try, but it's definitely not an ""essential"" movie.",0,0,0,0

I give it two stars because Palahniuk can clearly write well, but the whole theme of the book just put me off. And this is not because I particulary dislike books that contain violence and anti-social behaviour- I loved Burgess' brilliant A Clockwork Orange, for instance. I think the absence of humour put me off this book more than anything else.",0,0,0,0

I still have a couple from 15 years ago or more that still work fine.In earlier years they were rigid plastic, never cracked and looked just like this photo. In the last 2 years or so, the quality has taken a big dive. The wheels are always broken off by the shipping company; the last one I bought for our crew had different latches that broke right off the first time we shipped the trunk. An associate bought one...latches broke off immediately. There is NO handle now and this is a big minus. We have never shipped without zip-tying through the lock holes and strapping around the trunks at both ends. Despite all attempts to improve results, these things now seem bent on self-destruction and I am looking at several that are only good for storage. I just took two relatively new ones to the town dump as they were so badly cracked they couldn't even be used for that.

R3SB6Z9VZFN768,"The first problem, from which this book suffers is that it is essentially a  compilation of  what are intended to be humorous comments, with little no plot to sustain them.  Unless books like that are read in very small doses they get quite old, quite fast.  It's like dessert--the first bite is always the best; soon after that the long term drawback of excess calories outweighs (if you'll pardon the expression)  the pleasure they provide.  So, whether you  like his humor or not, I would recommend small bites.The more difficult problem for me was that I found a lot of his attempts at humor fell wide of the mark--or at least, of my mark. And as I continued through the book this became a more serious negative.  I kept hoping things would get better, and they never did.  Having spent four years in the Navy, and about the same time before that proving that I was immature, I have been exposed to enough frat-boy humor and dirty words that I no longer find them amusing.  Nor do I find making fun of people who are doing their best particularly amusing. I will concede that Bryson is one of the better practitioners of this brand of humor, but it palls on me quite quickly.I finally gave the book two stars because it isn't really awful.  It just isn't worth the time to read it.Having said which, the book is not without its moments.  It's hard to miss being amusing if you keep at it long enough.  But it certainly has no value as a social commentary on small towns, and what amusement I occasionally got was not worth the effort.",0,0,0,0

So I file for a replacement and .... they don't accept them, only refunds which means I then have to drive 30 miles to my nearest UPS store to ship back $5.00 worth of ink. I'm screwed out of $5.00 because it's more of a waste in gas than anything. At least the others work, now I just have to actually spend $12 on a OEM 220.

She is a high school principal and he is the president of an alleged Motorcycle Club.She has had feelings for him for two years which he never reciprocates.  He’s using her connections to help him find his brother’s killer (unknown to her-she thinks she’s not attractive enough)When the killer is found and she finds out how he used her, she’s hurt and angry. She doesn’t want anything to do with him.He can’t accept that and when she’s seriously injured, one of the club girls picks her up under false pretenses from the hospital and delivers her to his clubhouse to recover.  She vehemently doesn’t want to be there but no one cares. She can’t walk anymore and is wheelchair bound until she learns to walk again. She’s carried up flights of stairs and moved into Viper’s room. That’s bad enough but viper never moves out. He insists on sleeping naked in the same bed, carrying her to the toilet, walking around naked. These two people dated casually before. They never had an intimate relationship. To me, he has kidnapped her to force his attentions on her because she doesn’t want anything to do with him.Every Friday night the club has an orgy and eventually viper brings her downstairs to one. Despite strenuous objections, he performs a sexual act on her in front of others. She’s ashamed and crying. REMEMBER THIS WOMAN CAN’T WALK YET. He’s lugging her all over the club where he wants to go and what he wants to do. She never gets a say.After the party, He carries her back to his room. Forces her into the shower with him tells her she’s only upset about the orgy party because she liked it so much and from now on she’s going to go. He likes sex in public so she’ll have to. Also, he decrees she can’t wear a nightgown anymore. (Once a month she may wear panties only). What a great guy.She’s a mature woman. As I said, a school principal. But she, like all the women involved with this club, turns into a complete doormat. I’ve read further into this series since writing this review and the plot is pretty much the same.

R9UJRY4IWA1O,"I am a big Harriet Evans fan and I don't think she gets the recognition she deserves. I must admit I wasn't sold on the synopsis of this one but thought I'd give it a try.The story follows Sophie, a film star, who is obsessed with another film star called Eve Noel. The thing is, Eve hasn't been seen for years and Sophie sets out to find her...I hated that the book was set mainly in America and I thought It was all very cliched. I aren't a big fan of mixed timeframe novels and this was no exception. I couldn't work out when it was a chapter by Eve and when it was one by Sophie.The sections when Sophie filmed in England, were so old fashioned. They could easily have been set in the 1950's. I didn't understand what was happening half the time, especially with the Eve/Rose scenario. I thought the section with the letters between Don and Eve/Rose were the most boring things I've ever read.This is the worst book Harriet Evans has ever written.

R12D0405DWJE57,"First of all, I have to say that the reader of this book does it a tremendous disservice.  He needs to get a new profession - can not do black voices (hello Uncle Tom), cannot do female voices (everyone over the age of 30 has a gravel voice).  His reading accentuates all the negatives in this book.To start with a positive, I think the book has a good plot.  But it appears to me to be written by someone who has done a lot of research on DC but doesnt live here (as I do).  There are so many things a Washingtonian would simply not do - including going to every top restaurant in DC (and knowing the owner) on a cops salary.  If Mr. Andrews did not have to have his perfect detective gratuitously be inhumanly kind, inhumanly knowledgeable, inhumanly cultured on every other page of the book (where the hell is his editor telling him to cut out half of this at least!), the plot would flow quite nicely.  Also, I have to say I'm offended every one of the million or so times he calls his black partner, Jose or Josiah ""Hoser"".  I do not see how this book got as good a rating as it did - but maybe its better in print than in audio.  This however, will be my last reading of a Robert Andrews mystery.

RM4V8XZGQ27CO,"This movie can be watched and enjoyed without for a moment taking it seriously on any level.  It is much better than the box office tells us.  The producers spent $8 million but it brought in a tiny $34,000 in general release.  I wonder how long it will take to claw back the budget on DVD and TV?  I found it quirky and fun.  I did not believe any bit of it for a second, which explains the low rating.  Sam Rockwell plays a hit man who has mended his ways and no longer kills people for money.  He does however kill people who, as they say in Texas, just need killing.  In particular he slays with a lavish hand those who might in the past have employed his services.  Not all bad guys have learned of his change of heart, which causes a lot of problems.  Not for Rockwell, who has the reflexes of an Olympian.  He runs into Anna Kendrick (who I just saw in The Accountant) and the two hit it off.  We know Kendrick best for her comic roles and this one must be included in that category.  Also worth watching are Tim Roth, Anson Mount and rapper RZA as various bad guys.  This R rated, blood drenched comic take on multiple killings will please those with a particular frame of mind.

I finally decided to spend a little extra on a printer to solve all the problems I have had with the cheap/free ones.  I really liked the features and design of the Pro901 and what finally sold me was the inexpensive ink.  Well, it didn't turn out so well.  One of the main features that I was interested in was being able to scan to e-mail.  THIS FEATURE DOES NOT WORK WITH WEB-BASED E-MAIL.

I have had this printer for almost a year now and have probably printed less than 200 pages with it.  Some may point out that you need to use an inkjet more often to get consistent results but this problem started right off the bat.  The issues varied from colors that would not print at all to striated print to alignment issues.  I've had to replace cartridges even when they are still full to get that color working.  So much for the cheap ink.  I've run through all of the printer troubleshooting steps.  I've also had various wireless connectivity issues.

Very sadly both did not work for me. I was too trusting about the reviews so I didn't try the toner right away when received. I waited till the Brother TN450 was completely out (more than 3 months passed after I made the purchase). Therefore, I can't return or replace them because the seller only provided 30 day return policy. Luckily I found on Youtube how to refill the TN450. I followed the refill instruction and dumped the black powder from the non-working OEM one and filled the Brother one. It worked!! So I don't need to throw away the un-compatible ones. It is also cheaper to buy the ""powder"" and re-fill by myself.",0,0,0,0

RQK1X8W0626CU,"Despite strong performances by Mr. Butler this movie is patently a glorified snuff film. This film should be rated NC-17 or some version of rated XXX This is wanton pornography on every screen in almost every shot in the background of every moment and violence in a blender.  I find it hard to even comment on the absolutely perverted minds that wrote the screenplay.  Straight from the demonically inspired imaginations of two Luciferian freaks. The whole concept of ""what if the games because so real that people started controlling other people in the games"" could have been done without any of the gore. I found (spoiler alert) the rave scene where a woman's brains and blood are splattered across 4 topless women who then begin sexually making out and touching in the bloodbath to loud moaning sounds particularly horrifying.  This is the stuff that forged Ted Bundy. This could have been a love story but instead, this was simply a disgusting snapshot into screenwriters Neveldine/Taylor's own psychotic lusts.

R2QGG6NDKXD3NR,"If I'd left a review of this product within the first few weeks of use, I would've given it 4 or 5 stars; it's lightweight, pretty, and worked like a dream, even if the side drawer tended to stick, mine never came with a baffle, and I never figured out how to lift the table like the pictures showed. However, after a month or so, the orange pieces meant to hold the screws in had fallen off -- one had snapped entirely, cracking in half like the Titanic -- and one of the screws had fallen out and was never seen again (probably hiding out under some furniture as a very inconvenient cat toy). By the time the fan itself stopped working, three screws had fallen out and none of the orange pieces were intact.Even though the legs were so damaged they wouldn't stand up on their own (and had a tendency to fall off), I still used the table because the fan was so handy. I wasn't happy with the product, but I wasn't going to throw it away while it still served its purpose. After about 4 months, even that stopped working; I tried every USB port on several computers, and the fan wouldn't turn on for any of them.Now it's a hunk of dead wood in the corner of my living room, the remnants of a very expensive good idea.

R1TYQHIMKF74ZM,"SPOILER ALERT!!!!!I've come to the conclusion recently that a book which is turned into a film is sort of an evolution in story telling.  That one format is not inherently better than the other.  Sometimes the book is better, sometime the film is better.  Sometimes both are excellent.  For example I recently watched the fairly recent film ""The Painted Veil"", and then read the novel by Somerset Maugham.  I enjoyed both, immensely.  The film version of this novel -- ""Random Harvest"" -- starring Ronald Colman and Greer Garson is one of my very favorite films...in my top 5 of all time.  So, after watching the film so many times, I thought it was time that I read the novel.  I assumed it would be as enchanting for me as the film.I was wrong.  To me, a better title for the novel would be ""Ramble Harvest"", because it seems to me that Hilton rambles on and on with a great deal of story telling that has nothing to do with this story.  Frankly, virtually all of part I (whatever happened to chapters?) could have been left out.  Even after that, there is simply too much wandering around that never gets to the point of the novel -- how Charles gets his memory back...or even much about his memory at all.  Yes, it is very clever how he surprises the reader at the very end of the book with the revelation that his secretary is his first wife from his other memory period.  Very clever writing, but I doubt many people beyond the first few readers didn't learn of the ending in advance.I know that I am in the minority here.  Others seem to really like this novel.

R2H3FHGP1H0KB0,"Although Christopher Paolini must be commended for writing a huge novel at the age of fifteen, his creativity does not deserve the same. The overall plot is that a boy, Eragon, finds a valuable ""gem"" that happens to be a dragon egg, which subsequently hatches. He becomes a Dragon Rider (read: ""The Dragon Riders of Pern""), who have been extinct for hundreds of years (read: ""Star Wars"" jedi). He goes on and travels across the continent to his destination (which turns out to be a volcano: sort of like Mount Doom from ""Lord of the Rings""), meets a lone voyager along the way, who just happens to have a secret, dangerous past and who also agrees to help Eragon to his destination (read: Aragorn from ""Lord of the Rings""). There are evil beings that are not really alive nor dead and ride dragons, searching for the egg that the boy found (read: the Nazgul or the Black Riders from ""Lord of the Rings""). Even the names of places are too coincidental to not be copied (read: Isenstar -> Isengard?).  Not only that, but Paolini's writing style is not very smooth. It is difficult for most high schoolers and older persons to get into the action in the book because the disrupted writing flow prevents that. For middle schoolers and younger, however, this book is a hit, because they focus mostly on action, which this novel has plenty of. Sometimes the action is simply strange and doesn't seem to fit, but most of the time it works fine. The vocabulary is also exceptional, but it may be a bit too much.  Overall, I believe that Paolini has gotten a head start, thanks to his age, and I hope that he will work to improve his writing. A good writer always strives to improve; I will be eagerly watching Paolini's career for this.",0,0,0,0

R1LDEB54RXOEW6,"The Diva has finally succumbed to the pressures of the market place, her success and of course her wrecked family. As the stories of her drug abuse, Bobby `Bad Boy' Brown and dismal last album surface, her record label seems  to have thought it timely to release a double set `Greatest Hits"". The  package aims to collate the best of her 15-year, 4 CD career.  The two CD  set comprises Whitney's best known and loved hit songs. The second part is  a more adventurous set featuring many of her songs remixed by a star set of  DJs and Remix artists.  Set one has all the usual suspects like the syrupy  and cheesy `Saving All My Love For You', `Didn't We Almost Have It All',  `Greatest Love Of All',  `All The Man I Need', `Exhale (Shoop Shoop)' and  `Why Does It Hurt So Bad'. Soft and gooey stuff indeed, barf bag and  tissues not included. For reasons known best to the record label gurus,  they have omitted mega-hits like `I Want To Dance With Somebody', `I'm  Every Woman (with Chakka Khan)' and `When You Believe (with Mariah  Carrey)'.  The Remix set stars mix-maestros such as Junior Vasquez (Step By  Step), Civilles & Cole (I'm Every Woman) and David Morales (Love Will  Save The Day). The remixes range from decent to uninspired. Big name DJs  working big hit records result in disappointing dance-floor material. The  `House' flava dance music gets a bit too much and imminently pointless.  In  closing, there is too much missing, too many gaps and quite a few poor  selections. If Whitney was a horse, this would be the biggest `flogging of  a dead horse ever'.",0,0,0,0

R1896GLU2KJDOZ,"the first coldplay song i ever heard was 'shiver'. i liked it enough to buy the single and was further impressed when i later heard 'yellow'. the two catchy singles gave me the impression that their debut album, 'parachutes', would be something to look forward to. i wasn't unimpressed but underwhelmed. i felt it was a promising album and i liked the wide-eyed, naivety of it.the jump from 'parachutes' to 'a rush of blood to the head' was immense. the first song on the album, 'politik', immediately showed their growth. chris martin was now singing, ""look at earth from out of space, everyone must find their place,"" a big jump from 'yellow' where he sang, ""look at the stars, see how they shine for you,"" no longer looking up at the sky, martin was now up in space looking down. this mirrored his band's new status. 'parachutes' made them popular in the uk but 'arobtth' put them into the stratosphere.so their third album should in theory make them one of the biggest bands in the vast music universe. 'x&y' has gone number 1 in a number of countries including here in the states. obviously it will sell probably a billion copies as people buy it to see what the fuss is about. do the numbers reflect the songs though?first single 'speed of sound' sounds like a small version of clocks. it did eventually grow on me but it still feels like coldplay are retreading old ground. i've read a number reviews saying this new album is sonically more interesting and denser. all the synths and weird noises can't save lines like, ""i could write a song, a hundred miles long,"" as martin sings on 'swallowed in the sea'. this is the reason i've only rated this album 2 out of 5. if it was not for the sincerity that martin sings i would be cringing at various points throughout the album.on their previous albums martin sings in the first person. an example being on 'the scientist' where he says, ""come up to meet you, tell you i'm sorry, you don't know how lovely you are,"" that album was full of personal songs. it made me feel like i was getting a small glimpse into another person's life and in particular their heartbreak. with 'x&y' the tables are now turned. martin is now so confident he wants to turn the focus on us, the listener.for me this was the biggest problem i had with this album. i'm sure i'm being overly sensitive but there seems to be an on-going theme where martin feels he has to remind me i'm incompetent. on the kraftwerk-sampling 'talk' he sings, ""are you lost or incomplete? do you feel like a puzzle you can't find your missing piece?  tell me how you feel"" besides a bad metaphor and sounding like dr. phil, it is condescending. who does martin think his audience is? a bunch of emotionally-stilted introverts in need of rescue? things get worse on 'low' when he states, ""all you ever wanted was love, but you never look hard enough,"" well gee, thanks for telling me that, and he wonders why some people call his music depressing. i could carry on with similar lyrics but that would be as annoying as the lyrics themselves.to be fair the album's main theme is of love and loss. the opposite feelings of complete happiness and the pain of losing someone or something. the x and y if you will. so highlights? only one comes to mind and that is 'fix you'. if martin really does think his audience are emotionally-stilted introverts this would be the song to rescue them. starting with just martin's vocal and an organ it starts slowly and doesn't get interesting until johnny buckland's guitar chimes in. the momentum builds and climaxes with will champion's drums and guy berryman's bass filling in the technicolour wall of sound. i'm sure by now this has become the song known as, ""the one where they sing a four-part harmony,"" more just a gimmick it sounds warm and inviting. it's what they do best, simple songs about love.you may be thinking, hold on, i'm contradicting myself at the moment. i don't like this album because of the examples i showed earlier but yet my favourite song features the line, ""tears stream down your face, when you lose something you cannot replace,"" so yes i am contradicting myself but i guess that's the x and y of me.'x&y' is an accomplished album. the new sounds show some evolution and a hint that they may sound more electronic in the future. this third time around they seem more like a real band. on the previous albums it could just have easily been martin solo with a backing band. these new songs though sound like they'd fall apart if one member was taken away. you get to see more of their personalities through the songs. johnny this time is louder and less shy. will sounds solid and powerful. guy provides life with his slinky basslines. and chris? he's just chris.i really wanted to love this album. i tell myself that it'll grow on me but i know it won't. it's like when you're already in love with something. if something different comes along, you know it doesn't feel right and you don't want to settle for anything less. 'a rush of blood to the head' is that something. 'x&y' will have to deal with the rejection. from me at least.",0,0,0,0

R3TDJ2FPGIF9P8,"I bought this printer based on reviews here and at other sites.  The cost per page was a definite plus. The installation went well and I thought this was the best printer ever....Until today.  My wife was printing some paperwork when the print head error message came up.  I carefully followed the cleaning instructions and when that did not work I called customer service and waited patiently for 10 minutes, finally I connected to a tech who downloaded the latest firmware, to no avail.  Then he told me that I,yes,I damaged the print head and they would send out another print head in 3 or 4 days.  3 or 4 days is unacceptable when there is work to be done.  I have to have a printer so I will be going out and buying a reliable but expensive(ink-wise) HP.  I had so much hope for this printer, I really thought it was the best printer I had ever owned.Update 9-9-2011;I see a theme running through the bad reviews.  I have always trusted the  2,3,star reviews over the 1 and 5,  This printer and other lexmark printers seem to have print head problems.  This seems to be a problem that has been occurring over the last year and a half. Lexmark folks,if you read these reviews.....and I know you do, you might want to pick up on this issue and find a permanent fix.  As for the ink issue, I have yet to find your $5.00 cartridge except during your return program.  I spent at least 14.00 for 5 cartridges to get that 5.00 cartridge.  I am not saying do not buy this printer....it does have a place in the market, just know what you are getting.  This is definitely not a business class printer.  You will wait for several days for a new ""Print head"".",0,0,0,0
R3JSUK8B4O9Y5F,"Update below.This is a great little scale for weighing all types of things in the kitchen.  I mostly use it for making soap but use it for general kitchen use and making lotions and other uses.  My one major complaint is the auto-off feature.  It is not customizable and you can't shut it off.  I often have to start over measuring things as it shuts off after a very short amount of time (supposedly 2 minutes but I think it is a lot shorter than that).  It would be really nice to just have a button or toggle to just turn the auto shut-off off.  I don't care if it eats up batteries.  They are cheap and my time is not.And I have to second what some other reviewers have said, the buttons are way to shiny and they are hard to make out in regular light.  I can't really tell what one button says from the other one and it is a little frustrating.  They could make them way more readable and it would make the scale much more usable.But I have tried several other scales and this beats the other ones hands-down.  Don't let the small size fool you.  It is more accurate than much larger and more expensive one.  Maybe much more expensive lab scales might do a better job, but for this price, you can't get a better value.UPDATE:  ONLY LASTED A FEW MONTHS AND I DIDN'T EVEN USE IT THAT OFTEN.  THE SCALE WAS ALWAYS STORED IN THE ORIGINAL BOX.",0,0,0,0

So while this turned out to be a very good machine until it started to leak  I’m giving it a very low rating because of the fact it does not last long it’s not like it was being moved around or anything just sitting in one place and starts to fall apart I will have to try and buy another one but definitely not from this merchant,0,0,0,0
R3QNJV1HH71485,"This was a joke, right?We wanted a scale that would allow us to weigh our small animals(rabbits and dogs) plus one that would be useful for our business, we mail things daily. I read the reviews. I am wondering what on earth I received that others were Ok with it. First, the packaging. It was thrown into cardboard box while in China(known by packaging) with pieces of Styrofoam. So what, you say? Styrofoam is good. Pieces of Styrofoam, as in crushed up little bits of Styrofoam with some bigger chunks haphazardly thrown in. It was on everything. It took me 2 hours to remove all of it. No inside packaging--the seller shipped it ion the same plain cardboard box from china. You have to screw feet onto it. There are some other screws, I assume to mount the reader? The manual(piece of paper) is written in really awful Chenglish(Englese?). It makes no sense. They used the word counterpoises--that isn't a thing. The plug is a knock-off white Apple plug, everything else is black. A 5lb weight weighs 4.87. Both did, I thought maybe it was the weight. All our pets weights were off by several ounces. A 3lb weight weighed 2.9, 2.87(it likes.87) and 2.93. Also wrong in kg. I thought maybe it isn't in precision mode(used for smaller weights?) All the manual says on that subject is that different models have different modes--helpful! Changing the mode changed nothing. Also, the display randomly blinks on/off when plugged in. The buttons aren't clearly marked either--worn off? I never bothered with the batteries--couldn't get the Styrofoam off the holder. Just don't buy it.",0,0,0,0

There are holes in the cap so the markers dry out. I've had them barely a month and they are all dried out. Buying another set (I need them for an upcoming GRE at-home examination) and will try sealing them in a plastic ziplock bag when not using them. So frustrating. Also, the ultra fine point goes away fairly quickly. I have been using one pen a lot (in an attempt to preserve the others!) and don't push hard but it's last the 'ultra fine' characteristic. It's still fine for what I need (doing lots of math). The most frustrating part is how quickly these pens dry out.

R1WEQDCML4BE1Y,"If you’re after the short, down and dirty version, here it is…This program is a complete waste of time and energy.Now, for the actual review.If you’re after a simple GPS or mapping program, others are freely available.  And this program is about as far from “simple” as any software I’ve ever written, reviewed, tested, or even seen.  It’s “EZ Nav Route Wizard” is their sad attempt at providing a simpler interface by bypassing most of their ""features"", but it’s power is nil.  If you want simple directions from one place to another, that’s their way of giving it to you.  However, I’m baffled by why, if that’s what you’re after, you’re even considering this.  What DeLorme should have done, instead of wasting time developing a goofy simplistic option like this and sticking it in their ridiculously bulky and inefficient program is spend some time and effort simplifying the entire thing.  Imagine the control panel/dashboard of a 777 jetliner, with a seemingly infinite array of stuff, and a button in the middle that says “Fly to Chicago”.  Yeah, nice idea DeLorme.  Why not just make the thing easier to fly?  See, the bottom line is none of us is trying to fly a jetliner, we’re just trying to drive to a few places as quickly, easily and efficiently as possible, and we don’t need the dash of a 777 to do it.If, like many people who were abandoned by Microsoft when they stopped producing Streets & Trips even though it was consistently rated #1, you’re looking for a program that serves as a GPS and a routing program, DELORME STREET ATLAS IS NOT IT.  This program has extremely limited power in this regard – so much so that there’s no way to include it in that category.  If you, for instance, have a round trip to plan, where you know your start and end points, and have multiple stops to make but aren’t sure what order to put them in, or lets say you’re a service technician or salesman or a delivery person and you’re trying to maximize your efficiency by adjusting your start and stop times for each day, along with the duration of each of your stops, throwing sticks to the wind and trying to make sense of where they land might be more productive than using DeLorme SA.  It allows for NO start or stop time, and entering a duration for each stop is enough to make you want to hurt people.  As a comparison, in MS S&T, if you want to adjust your start time or a stop’s duration, you simply double click that address in the left pane, which lies in the same window as the place where you entered it.  Up pops the time window for that stop.  If you want to do it in DeLorme  SA, here are the steps…  make sure you’re in the Route tab.  Then click the Advanced button on the bottom left.  Then locate (scroll if necessary) the stop you’d like to adjust and click on it in the center pane.  Then click the Stop Pref’s button on the right side.  NOW you can enter a duration for your stop.  It makes me imagine a microwave where the some of the number buttons are on the left of the microwave, some are in the middle below the door, and the rest of the buttons are on the right side, and they seem to have forgotten to put a ""start"" button on the thing. And for good measure, let’s remove all the quick setting buttons from the microwave.  You know, the quick minute button and all those – they’re way too useful.My bottom line for this software is you’re probably only looking at it for one of a few reasons, and it just doesn’t do a good job at ANY of them.  You’re options for a Streets and Trips replacement are thin for sure, and I’m still looking.  If that’s what you’re in search of, good luck, SA is NOT IT.  If you need a simple GPS/mapping program, this is NOT IT.  Simple isn’t apparently in this software team’s vocabulary.  And if you’re looking for a routing program of any kind, with any level of efficiency to it at all, this is also NOT IT.This is, hands down, the single worst-written piece of software I’ve laid my eyes on since the Windows 3.x days.  I wish 0 stars was an option.  No joke.",0,0,0,0
R3JPCHDZDADPPU,"I've been meaning to write a review for some time regarding the use of these inks for photographic prints.  In short, don't purchase any of this brand for photography prints.

The prints were not in direct sunlight.For photo quality prints, use the brand name.  I use these cheap inks only for handouts or something where quality and longevity is not a concern.I simply remove and installed the Canon inks when I want to print quality photographs and leave these low cost inks installed for most other color printing.I noticed there are some complaints about the leaking with the older cartridges and it's more than likely due to not removing the pressure equalization tape before removing the main cover.

Acting is at best workaday, and at times the worst kind of hamming. Hugo Weaving's laugh towards the end comes straight out of the pantomine top-drawer.If you go to see it for a conclusion to the series - don't bother.

There are more holes in the plot than in swiss cheese - but the point is you can't be bothered with working out why - you are not drawn into the characters  or situations.I could go on, but I can't be bothered to expend any more effort on this - precisely the attitude that the filmmakers seem to have adopted.",0,0,0,0

R1PPDCZ2QFCOQG,"I've been reading reviews on Amazon for many years. I'm always surprised when I find so many negative reviews written about such successful writers. After reading the reviews of Patterson's Private, I'm surprised it was able to garner as many stars as it did. So mostly out of curiosity, I read Private to see if it was a bad as so many reviewers claimed it to be.I agree it was not the best Patterson book I've ever read. I guess even successful authors are allowed an occasional miss. Perhaps the effort reflects more about the co-author Maxine Paetro than it does about Patterson himself.  At any rate, I don't think I would read another novel with this same combination of authors on the cover.Nevertheless Private wasn't as bad as many reviewers claim. I suspect they are spoiled by the really good Patterson novels they have read in the past. It's ok to be disappointed. I'm sure most of the Patterson novels are well worth your time even if this one isn't.",0,0,1,1
R28WF8V2X5E6PA,"To echo the sentiments of many other reviewers, I am impressed by the fact that Christopher Paolini began this book, part one of a series, when he was only fifteen years old. This novel tells the story of Eragon (which is dragon spelled with an ""e""), a young boy who finds a magical `stone' that turns out to be a dragon egg. The egg hatches into amagical creature and Eragon discovers that he possesses the rare and coveted talent of being able to communicate with dragons. Eragon learns much from the dragon, as well as an ex-dragon rider named Brom, and comes to realize that he will play an important role in an impending conflict with evil to determine the fate of their land. They begin their adventures that take them to many mystical places and along the way the young Eragon slowly matures into a budding warrior clearly destined to save the world from the evil of King Galbatorix.  I would not consider myself a `fan' of fantasy fiction, which is probably why I liked thisbook. I have read Tolkien and I can clearly see his influence in Paolini's writing. However, I was somewhat disappointed in the shallowness of Paolini's characters and the lack of scene-description that made Tolkien's writings so incredibly popular. The concept of aselect breed of warriors destined to protect the world also seems to be quite Jedi-esque and the idea of dragon riders is borrowed as well. There are the common fantasy characters of elves and dwarves that many will recognize. But something tells me that those who are avid fantasy and science fiction readers may be somewhat disappointed in this novel. The pace is quick and the book is packed with plenty of action, enough to keep most readers interested to the end.  If you like fiction, but are basically so-so when it comes to fantasy, you'll probably enjoy this book as I did. But if you consider yourself a master swordsman of science fiction and fantasy, then the borrowed concepts and inexperienced writing may leave you with a generic taste in your mouth, looking for a brand name item.Reviewed on behalf of readandreview [...]",0,0,0,0

RPUEVSYO2QT4D,"Consider this movie a precursor to next week’s deep dive into the horror films of the 2000’s. It’s an example of the creative voices of that era — Wes Craven and Kevin Williamson, whose Scream would lead to a renaissance of horror on screens — and Bob and Harvey Weinstein, whose heavy-handed production often led to films turning into hellish battles.For example, there’s an entirely different cut of this movie, with two different versions of the werewolves by Rick Baker and KNB replaced with CGI and entire characters — Omar Epps, Skeet Ulrich, Mandy Moore, Heather Langenkamp, Illeana Douglas, Scott Foley, Robert Forster and Corey Feldman are all pretty much exorcised in the cut that ended up being released — being included.The Weinsteins — beyond the numerous scandals — ruined plenty of genre films despite Dimension Films being a studio known for their release. Craven also had a career marked with movies that were taken over by studios and chopped up against his will.Cursed would be the perfect storm of these two groups working together.Star Jesse Eisenberg would tell Bloody Disgusting that there were so many reshoots — Judy Greer has said that it felt like they shot the movies for seven years — that they could have made four movies in the time and energy that it took to make this movie. These reshoots took the film from an R-rated film to a more PG-13 friendly version, but along the way, the film’s narrative cohesion was destroyed.So what’s it all about? It all begins with Mya and Shannon Elizabeth’s characters getting a dark fortune from a gypsy, which comes true moments later. After a car crash with Eisenberg and Christina Ricci’s characters, a wolf comes out of nowhere and devours Elizabeth. As for Mya, she’s soon killed after flirting with Ricci’s boyfriend at a party.The big reveal of all of this is that said boyfriend — Jake, played by Joshua Jackson — has passed on the curse of the werewolf through sexual contact, turning all of his one-night stands into monsters. The film also claims that the transfer of blood can make one a werewolf as well, which explains how the dog Zipper can become a beast.I feel like every time I talk about a Wes Craven movie post-Freddy I have to include the phrases studio interference, reshoots, directorial cut and lost footage. You’d think after his successes — The Last House on the Left, The Hills Have Eyes, A Nightmare on Elm Street, Scream — he’d be allowed to do whatever he wanted. Instead, we have movies like Deadly Friend and this one, where scripts were tossed out and studio interference led to movies that tarnished his name above the film.",0,0,0,0

The narrators preachy tone add to that effect (maybe it would seem less Fox-News-y in print).The title is also bait-and-switch; this book will tell you nothing of Thomas Jefferson's complex character or  decision making process, the focus is on the military men and a few diplomats..

They were mentioned as facts but I was not able live the story with Mr. Wiener. I did not like the excerpts on public speaking. I wanted to learn about his life and survival.  He obviously was able to deliver his story in a way that had meaning to many audiences, as shown in his letters.  However, I did not feel taken in.

RVPHVBIF9MRYF,"This is the first product review I have ever written but I feel the Neat system is such a bad product and people need to be warned about it.  I purchased the Neat scanner in June 2013 as a simple solution to keep receipts.  I am not new to scanning -- I have owned an Epson commercial scanning system for several years.  While Epson is good for large documents, small receipts are cumbersome.  So the Neat system seemed to be a good solution.The Neat software began to have trouble sometime around 4 or 5 months of use.  Technical support is nearly non-existent and the technical support staff is not very knowledgeable.  At the end of 2013, or after 6 months worth of scanned receipts, I decided that the prudent thing to do would be to archive the data  and start 2014 fresh.  I followed the Neat instructions to archive the data and the software produced a nice archive file.  Problem solved, so I thought.  Last week, I tried to go into the archive to retrieve a receipt and guess what only about 20 receipts had been archived -- there should have been probably 200 or 300 or so.  OK, I thought I'll get the receipts from the Neat cloud back-up.  And guess what the receipts weren't there either.  After several online chats with Neat technical support (live agents are apparently not available for phone conversations), the online agent concluded that the system had malfunctioned and my data had been lost.  There had been no warnings or anything -- just lost data.  Let's hope I never get audited.I should add I am quite adept and capable in terms of computer and networking literacy and experience and I own new, high quality computers with up-to-date software which are the core of my small accounting business.  Fortunately my client data has been collected using the Epson system and that system has never malfunctioned in roughly 5 years.  I should have never trusted the Neat system.  Bottom line -- poor software, poor technical support -- do not purchase unless you want to lose your data.  Mine is going into the garbage dumpster.",0,0,0,0

The name ""George R.R. Martin"" is printed 20 times as large as his co-authors, which gives the impression that he wrote the book, with some help of the other mentioned people. (Here in the review editing page, Martin is even declared as the sole author)An honest presentation would be to do it the other way round: Have the other names big and a small subline: ""with some guest contributions and approved by George R.R. Martin"" --- because that is what this book is in reality.If you want to buy this book because you want to know every detail about the world of Westeros and do not care if it comes from Martin or some fans, go ahead. Just know that the cover kind of lies about the authorship. It is not written by Martin, not even mostly, and that shows, because the writing style is even more bland and ponderous than Martin at his worst.This book is mostly fanfiction.

The story, unbelivable, disgusting at times, depressing all the timewith characters such as Pig, an obese woman, Madison, who is so hateful even when the author tries to give her authenticity through giving us snippets of Madison's diary, didn't work. Event after horrible event, when you think it can't get worse it does, but in a false way. I did read it fast, so I am thinking why? It was the tidbits of pearls here. The truth is the author speaking through Jessie, a woman who knows heartbreak and despair. I felt that truth that made her write such a horrible book. I read it for those pearls, her prose which comes out unexpectedly and grabs you. Like, ""I thought, Even love has it's limits, and I couldn't believe this hadn't occurred to him. and ""Liars attracted me because I was one myself""  This book lies yet doesn't. The author writes what she knows, Despair but it has no redemption, no happiness, no reality and even the most horrible life has joy. This book had no joy, only despair.

R1GGDLL2F65AVI,"Well, after a couple of weeks I've decided to put Eragon down unfinished. I made to page 462 before giving up. I started reading this to see what mistakes the author made, so that I don't make them in my own writing, and second, to try and figure out why on earth something this poorly written could end up a NYT bestseller. I got a lot of answers on the first one, but am still a little shaky on the second.I give it two out of five stars - I would have given it one star, except when I thought about it, I realized that I probably would have enjoyed this book when I was 8-9 years old. That's totally fair. It would have sparked my imagination, probably expanded my vocabulary (more on that later), and prompted me to continue reading fantasy, which I loved then and love now. So two stars for that.  Now the problems.First, voice. The single biggest issue here was vocabulary. I think without this problem, I might have finished the book. There's not really anything wrong with Paolini's writing, though there's nothing particularly compelling about it either. The thing is, he uses all the wrong words. Clearly the young man is very intelligent. However, at least at the time he wrote this book, he hadn't learned that the bigger word is not necessarily better - and often times, the bigger word is worse. This didn't leak into the dialogue much, but the narrative is littered with it.Second, plot. A lot has been said about this elsewhere, so I won't harp on it, but basically, if there's anything new in this story, I sure hadn't found it by page 462. This would be fine if I were 8 or 9 and not familiar with as much fiction as I am now, or if the voice was compelling enough, but as it was, it just turned into a game to guess what was going to happen next, and then it just got boring. Paolini is quoted on Wikipedia as saying that he purposefully included archetypal elements of fantasy, and that's fine, but the story still needs something to make it worth reading, and for me, this just didn't cut it.",0,0,0,0

RPDEL21YBRKZF,"Kay, I know my review is going to be seen as a bit harsh, and to be fair it IS but... this calculator cost me about $180 and for all of it's capabilities and their utility to me. I may as well have bought a $40-60, or used my computer.I am in a hard statistics class, and an equally difficult engineering class. One day I had discovered that I had lost the TI-92 I had bought years ago in high-school. I loved my TI-92 and it had proven useful well into college. I bought this because I had thought it was the most advanced calculator that TI had offered, and I had a test that day and NEEDED something to use to check my math. I expected it to have all of the functionality of my TI-92 at the very minimum.I was happy to discover that I no longer needed to use the TI-92's unnatural grammar to perform integrals, and sigma additions. (With all of the , separating clauses) Then I attempted to do a definite intigral between two numbers, and hit enter.""Unsupported on this calculator. Buy TI-nspire CAS""I cussed, then I flipped through the options, and chose indefinite intigral, figuring I could calculate it myself.""Unsupported on this calculator""I threw the calculator down on my desk with enough force to draw the attention of the TA who was giving the test. Honestly, the durability of the thing surprised me, it did not break.After a quick explanation as to the source of my behavior, the TA decided, fortunately, NOT to throw me out of the test. I continued the test, solving the integrals by hand, unlike any other student in the test, who were all equipped with the 'class recommended' TI-89. I ran out of time with a third of the questions unsolved.I'd return it, but the box is opened, and I don't have the receipt.Thanks TI! Thanks to you I only scored 61.2% on a test that I could have probably gotten about 90% on had I had a proper calculator that could do everything your more primitive models could do!

R10BEYCGCJPX2K,"I'm assuming as it's not stated by Amazon anywhere on this page to date that this is the Japanese mlps version and if so, this review refers to that version.This album is one of the greatest debuts ever by a rock band and is essential listening for fans and aspirants of good rock guitaring.  Although all the tracks have been tuned down to E flat tuning for the guitar (so if you've been trying to play along with the cd and have been finding it hard to do so this is the reason) some of rock guitar's standards are on this album and especially so for ""Eruption"" which is a tour de force of guitar flash playing.  The extremely tasty guitar licks on all the other tracks are also worth the purchase price of this baby.The remastering though is the 2001 version and so if you already have the old cd of this version, I'm struggling to find any extra value that will justify the hefty price tag on this baby when you are essentially paying for cardboard that isn't one of the better mlps designs that I've seen out there anyway.  The cardboard is thin and flimsy and looks as if it will come apart once the glue gets old.  For examples of good mlps designs, check out The Band and Hall & Oates releases which are simply works of art on good quality thicker and stronger cardboard.This is essential listening although this mlps version does not represent good value for money and if you already have a 2001 remastered version in the jewel case, you are better off sticking to it as this is no real upgrade to me.",0,0,0,0

R2CWLKZE5VF2HK,"2021 Review:Update:  I have lowered my rating to 1 star because Jarbo has not responded to numerous emails, including those asking for a delivery receipt and read receipt.  If you have a problem, it looks like they will not respond.This is an update to my previous 5 star review from an earlier order.  Everything was fine with the first pair of cartridges in 2019.  But this time, when I reordered in July 2021, I had problems with a cartridge not detected error message.  First, I would note that the cartridge looks a bit different compared to the first set, including how the chip is installed.  I tried all the usual stuff to try to get it to work, like turning the printer off and unplugging.I suspect there are many folks who would not know how to correct this.  I sent an earlier email to Jarbo support.  I will let them know about the problem.After an hour of fiddling around, I removed the cover plate that houses the chip.  I eventually figured out that the chip was installed backwards with both cartridges.  As soon as I turned it around, it worked fine.Attached are 2 pictures taken from the rear of cartridge with the chip removed and lying on top of the cartridge in front of cartridge slot.  There is a small cover that fits over the slot for the chip which has to be removed to get access to the chip.  The picture with the notches on the chip facing inward is how the cartridge came from Jarbo.  THAT IS WRONG.  The second picture shows the two notches facing outward, which is correct.2019 Review:Has worked fine for me.  At 4,000 ordinary text pages, it is beginning to lighten up.  I use a high quality bright Costco paper, not the super-cheap paper.  I have shaken the cartridge once and it has returned to normal, but typically this does not last very long.  Seller advertises 6,000 pages at 5% coverage.  It is always hard to tell what a particular user's average coverage actually is, so this may only reflect some higher coverage printing that I have done.  But I would rate this as a very good deal.  Will see how subsequent cartridges do.The Samsung print manager program shows that only 50% of the toner has been used.  Not sure how it calculates remaining toner.",0,0,0,0

RUVSPF1THO3SD,"There's an idiom you've heard, ""kill 'em all and let God sort 'em out"", which has been in use since the slaying of the Cathars (a precursor to the Protestants) in 1209 AD. It's an idiom which is altered for the dialog of this movie: they say ""kill 'em all and let Fate sort 'em out.""Why change ""God"" to ""Fate""? Well it's no surprise that the writer doesn't like to think about God. After all, one of the ten commandments is ""Thou shalt not kill."" And the moral of this movie is ""Killing people makes life exciting."" That's not a hyperbole; it's really the movie's closing sentiment. Sorry for the spoiler.Look, I'm an action movie fan, and I don't mind fictional killings that work to build a compelling story. It's just story-telling. But that doesn't mean I want a story that teaches killing is virtuous. Seriously, who in their right mind is on board with that?Beyond that enormous problem, Wanted doesn't offer much. It clearly mimics the Matrix, but in a way that makes no sense. The Matrix got to bend the rules of physics because the characters were in a computer simulation; Wanted bends the rules of physics just because hey why not.

R3NGW9H6C7DLNF,"First off in the interest of full disclosure: I am not a die-hard Rolling Stones or Keith Richards fan. I like their music, and I didn't think it would matter if I was a casual fan in terms of my reading and reviewing this book. The book is not associated with or blessed by Keith. So, you're basically getting some of Keith's life events and quotes and an author has turned them into a full book on Keith's ""wisdom"". I found a lot of quotes interesting as well as experiences about Keith, so perhaps I'd be better off finding a history book on Keith or the Stones rather than this loosely put-together book.In any case, the author has a chapter on ""what would Keith do"", based solely on Keith's experiences. Who knows if Keith would really do these things, but I find some danger in following the author's interpretation of what Keith would do in certain situations. At least if I knew they were coming directly from Keith, I could take them with a grain of salt but the author tries to pass this off as some type of self-help book. As I mentioned, there are some good quotes in here but I found quite a few repeated throughout the book to reinforce different views. I think this was mostly just a book of quotes and Keith-isms with a lot of filler in between for the sake of writing a book.On a side note, the abusive use of varying fonts throughout, especially for the chapter titles and the quotes, can be a bit distracting. I'm not a graphic designer or a font snob, but it just gave the book even less credibility. Also, I would have liked a photo or two, especially in the chapter describing how Keith came to put together his wardrobe of scarves, earrings, jewelry, hair adornments, etc.",0,0,0,0
