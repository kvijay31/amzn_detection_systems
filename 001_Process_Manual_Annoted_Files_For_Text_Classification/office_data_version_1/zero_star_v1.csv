R1CRQ4TO7TVZYI,So the image shows noodlers polar ink series and when I click it it still clearly says polar ink however when I got their basic brown I was confused. So I went to return it and its the basic brown image? Not sure If that's amazons fault or the seller but I'm dissapointed.For an actual review these inks are the worst for water but they work fine for copic inks. Polar inks work for both,0,0
R19JEPGLD3YJSH,I don’t think I have yet to write a negative review however I was in desperate need of this binder. When it arrived it was bent and ripped along one of the folds. I don’t have the time to return as I am using this to hold my 5th graders module 2 for math which if any parents knows is a huge amount of paperwork. I have used Avery in the past and it was always fine this I didn’t expect at all.,0,0
RITV3I7304IAG,"Doesn’t erase. Even after I used some elbow grease along with a microfiber cloth it’s still ‘stained’. Also, it’s fine for a flat surface but don’t try and apply to anything with an edge. It won’t stay. At all. Not even to a smooth refeidgerator surface.See pics. Very very disappointing. I agree with another reviewer that all of these can’t be legit.",0,0
R2C71Z7CM7WQ8O,"Sadly I wish I had read the reviews before buying. This tape seems good, sticky, okay, but you cannot use it with any dispensers which defeats the purpose. I've tried plastic dispensers that take refills, and I've tried heavy-duty office tape dispensers, and this tape won't work with any of them. The tape will not cut with the little serrated edge of the dispensers- it stretches and stretches until it either breaks off, or you have to cut it with scissors. Don't waste your money.",0,0
RGF63NTC51ASI,"The media could not be loaded.                      I am so disappointed. I bought this for my son. It came in with no ink. As you can watch in the video. For me, this is below zero for rating.",4,1
R13MB862AF37C3,I loved the product. Easy to print on using the website and sticks well. My only reason for the low stars is because I got less than 40 labels. Couldn't return as I started using them before I realized.,0,0
R2C7GGQTPQ7MIZ,This has almost no magnetic strength to to hold. Ended up gluing. Cant hold markers with its magnet either.  Have no idea how this product got a 4+ star ratings. Something fishy .,0,0
R25DAXD7P4ECWY,There was no ink. I had to spend more money on a better product. And I only gave it 1 star because I had to select a star In order to submit my review,1,1
R1GSLNHL8YQCVS,"Beware of hidden charges! You pay more than advertised.- I had been a customer of Phonepower for 2 years under the so called ""2nd year free"" plan. It's not free as advertised. You have to pay about $40 for a free service. (1st star has gone)- It says $199/year 2nd year free, but you have to pay about $240 for the first year and about $40 the second year. Do the math, you end up paying $12/mon. During 2 years, you may find better deals elsewhere.- International rates are before taxes and fees. Your final price is more than advertised. (2nd star has gone)- Had many interruptions of the service towards the end of first year. The technical service spent months to figure out the problem. Actually it was me who figured out that the adapter was defective. They blamed many other things like internet service etc. I sat down and had 3 hours long phone conversation to convince that the adapter was indeed defective. Finally got a new adapter and the service was fine thereafter.- I had a problem with a router (Asus RT-N56U); I couldn't hear inbound calls. Tech support spent hours again over the phone and finally declared the router was incompatible with their service. I figured out myself that it was a firewall setting that blocked inbound sound.- After 2 year they want me to continue with higher rate. They (also other companies) are more interested in attracting new customers than keeping the existing customer, a stupid move. (3rd star has gone)- All in all, I do not recommend this as the primary line for your house. The call quality was good with few exceptions. International call quality is not as good as local or national. Also, be aware of so many hidden charges.",0,0
R1F9J3ZWTFYLTX,"Have to say I really liked the product and didn’t have any issues with the pen itself not writing correctly. I genuinely really liked the pen itself but it ended in sad day however ☹️After only about 2 weeks when I realized the pen itself was lost. I did happen to notice that the pen was extending on its own on my key chain and had to keep pushing it back together periodically throughout the day to secure it. I didn’t really think much of it because it did appear to be hanging on the cap fairly well so just assumed the pen just gets pulled down as I walk and keys are rubbing on it. Then one day I get home from work and as I’m putting my keys down I notice that just the cap of the pen is all that remains.Really sucks too, I really loved the little pen and wish I could write a better review but unfortunately I cannot do so when the pen went missing after just 2 weeks. Very disappointed and don’t recommend to buy pen when it pops off the cap so easily.",0,0
R3RFEMLJPUNG59,"I bought these a few months ago at a retailer. But I'm leaving a review here to warn others not to buy! When I first opened the package on 3/4 markers worked. I had already thrown the receipt away an a couple of weeks had passed so I couldn't return them. Then a week after that only 2/4 worked. Now, just a few months later and with minimal use, none of them write. It's so frustrating to spend your hard-earned money on a product that's poorly made. Don't waste your money on this company's product. Other people have clearly had the same issue so it's obvious they've done nothing to address this.",0,0
R32FL97HIIP28I,"I am not a fan of pens that try to recreate the beauty of a fountain pen. However,  I've been a fan of Parker ball point pens for 50+ years. In the case of the Parker Reflex Pen, I am at best luke warm. The pen writes great and more than meets my needs as a note taker and signing pen. However, the pen loses the neatness test. I've had this same problem with pens form other manufacturers. The problem is the seepage of ink from the ink cartridge around the pen tip. Please refer to the pictures I provided with this review. In this case,  I am rooting for Parker that this is a fluke and the rest of the production run was OK.",0,0
RSPLCEBDLAON9,"Honey- Cannot-Do. Assembled cart, no problem. Took it to the supermarket for the first time. I have a twelve step climb to my house. By the time I got there, the wheels were out of whack, the axle was bent and the cart was coming apart. I should of romer foread the reviews before I bought this piece of crap. I have been an amazon customer for years. Surprised they let this junk slip by.",0,0
RPQPN8X2ERYCE,"I ordered this on Amazon and for some reason, my T50 3/8"" staples would not come out when operating.  It made an impressive SNAP, as if it wanted to work, but it was almost like the staples were too fat to be pushed out or something (which of course is not the case, as they are within spec of the stapler, and are Arrow brand themselves).I originally started to order a replacement, but needed the stapler that day.I triple checked everything just to make sure I wasn't doing something dumb, but definitely loaded the staples properly (from the bottom of the stapler, facing outward, not on the rail (of course) like the directions say) To further reinforce not doing something boneheaded, the Bostitch stapler/brad combo I picked up at Lowe's worked flawlessly.  That particular model isn't on Amazon, or I'd link to it and review it as well.I give the product two stars as I didn't give it a second chance due to my time constraints, as I truly do conclude it was a lemon based on the reviews.  Otherwise I would give it one star.  Frankly, first time operation is part of what determines a product's rating, so a trend of ""the first one didn't work"" should be noted.  Of course it happens...no hard feelings toward the company.  Sort of like when GE wised up that their first-gen hybrid water heaters had some horrible quality control in China...moved production back to US.  I digress.  But you get my point.Of course, Amazon makes it fairly painless either way to obtain RMA, shove it in a box and drop off at UPS location.",0,0

R3P7HKNAYYVB9M,"Despite other reviewers mentioning the ink did not work with their HP 6310 all in one printers I decided to give this a try because it was so inexpensive. Unfortunately, same story for me. The black ink came through ok but the color was terrible.",0,0
R2UONJRFYKXF0L,I bought these pens for my current college quarter and have used the black ink pen the most. They write as described and I actually liked writing with them but the tip of my black pen has shortened to the point that I can no longer write with it. It actually only lasted exactly 17 pages of writing. (I wasn't expecting for the tip to shorten... I was actually thinking that It would either run out of ink or the ink might dry up after a while before anything else). Two stars for being nice pens and good for drawing and writing but ... they don't seem to last. I wish it had more black ink pens than just one.,0,0

R27XP52CL9MNIP,"The idea is nice, but the execution is lacking. I lost the first one because I didn't seat the cap all the way, or so I thought. I bought a second and used the cap from the first one, the second pen came off some where. I can't rule out user error could have played a part in my pens going missing, hence two stars. If you are fastidious with this you will probably be fine, but I found a small pen with a good clip is much better. Like this one:https://smile.amazon.com/Zebra-SL-F1-Ballpoint-Silver-BA55-S/dp/B003G0YWJ6/ref=pd_cart_rp_1_2?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B003G0YWJ6&pd_rd_r=YMTBGMA19X74KN0MZBG1&pd_rd_w=xqpxm&pd_rd_wg=krDyf&pf_rd_i=cart-page-widgets&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_p=3457867853211955575&pf_rd_r=YMTBGMA19X74KN0MZBG1&pf_rd_s=cart-page-widgets&pf_rd_t=40701&refRID=YMTBGMA19X74KN0MZBG1&th=1",0,0
R3N84C4QU2MKFQ,"I bought these pens after reading the positive reviews.  The ink in nearly HALF of my pens does not flow.  The nubs of the defective pens scratch the writing surface due to their extra fine points.  Even the pens that write reasonably well will not write at high speed because the ink skips unevenly.  I would urge anyone purchasing these pens to test each pen during the 30 day period so you won't forego the right to return them, or consider buying a regular nub vs. extra fine.  I need the extra fine point for detail work but it doesn't work for speed writers like me.",0,0
R10U181JPQ34AL,"The coin is okay but not as pictured. VERY DISAPPOINTED! I thought this coin was going to come with a nice card as per reading other reviews and noticing it in the photo. I don't always base my idea of what is coming by only the photo but TWO reviews specifically stated the coin came with the card. Now, I need to have someone purchase a card to present this to my hubby for our anniversary. I am recovering at home from surgery and no way to travel. Thought this would be the solution to both a card and sweet gift. The coin came loose in a huge box buried under another item. It was in a little plastic bag. No care involved with the idea pictured or the packing. Good thing I noticed it! I would have bought more for other relatives, but after the condition it which it arrived... sorry no more purchases.",0,0
R1YB2S9M5GJ2DW,"We needed to replace an X-Acto model which died after five years of service.  Decided to try AFMAT brand and now sorry that I did.  Although design is attractive, out-of-the-box our motor stopped running before the pencil was sharp so not an overheating issue.  Suspect a defective sensor, switch, and/or motor.  The variable sharpening feature with three settings is innovative, but the top mounted switch is flimsy and can easily change from one setting to another if you brush your hand anywhere close to it.  More positive ""click stops"" for each setting would have been better.  Returned this one and will most likely go back to using an X-Acto brand.I'm upgrading my review because the seller made a prompt and sincere effort to replace the product under warranty.  As a result, I would not hesitate to use this seller again.  In the end; however,  this product failed to meet my expectations for functionality and quality control.",0,0

R33EN8NIM08TU6,"I am disappointed in this product. While the reviews on here seem great, the folders I ordered were not what I was expecting. The print is blurry and smudged. I can't tell if these are knock-offs or not but my set was just not worth the money.Giving it 2 stars because I am still using them ( I didn't want to be wasteful) and I do like that they provide a lot of space... I just wish that the print was more clear and precise.",0,0
R314KQLDV1Q14I,I really should have read the reviews.  It's junk and I can't believe I paid $20 for this piece of cr*p. It won't even hold the push pins because it's so thinly made.  There's a paper thin piece of cork board with a piece of cardboard in back. Worse thing I've ever bought.,0,0
R73R0IV1OGGKN,"holy moly... do not buy!!! not worth it. bought it reading at the reviews.. most of these reviews are lies... there should be no reason for this pen to cost this much and have this high of a rating,... the only thing about this pen is the durability... the ink keeps blending out... the end where you write from, the place where the ink comes out, has an opening so big that every time i lift my pen off the paper and put it down again for another letter, i get clicking sounds every 1 second.",0,0
R3PZZP9TF01K2O,"Every single cartridge, upon opening the orange tab, leaked ink everywhere. Now it's on my hands, my clothes, my desk, and my carpet. I'll be going with OEM in the future. Gave 2 stars because, after cleanup, they actually worked in my printer.",0,0
R52IKQ1J8F51U,"I was looking for a clear standard size clipboard, when I happened across this one.  I wasn't sure about the ""flat clip"" design, but I decided to give it a try.The pros:+ Low cost, $3.99 with free shipping, when I bought mine.+ Good product reviews.+ Clear, modern looking acrylic board.+ Imprinted ruler.  Inches on the right side & centimeters on the left side.The cons:- The plastic wrapper is difficult to remove, especially around & under the clip.- No place to clip a pen or pencil, like on a traditional clipboards.- The paper isn't clipped flat to the board, but is raised about an 1/8th of an inch at the flat clip.  This is due to the design of the ""flat clip""- The hanging tab hole is too small & the tab rattles when using the clipboard... very annoying!  I decided to cut it off! :(Closing thoughts:I thought this updated design would be an improvement, but I was wrong.  I've since ordered this clipboard:  Sparco Transparent Plastic Clipboard, 9 x 12-1/2 Inches, Clear (SPR01860)  It costs a bit more, but it has the traditional clip with a larger hanging hole. :)",0,0
RC0IBPXUSS49Z,Amazon needs to add a ZERO star rating.  The wifi/ethernet connection started to be intermittent after a year (from several different computers and operating systems).  It no longer prints reliably.  If I could return it I would as well as trying to get my money back for the number of expensive ink cartridges trying to get this piece of garbage to work.,1,1

R29ETQV5GBQ9UV,"I really want to love these pens. I bought a bunch of them in various colors and used them for all of my writing at school and at work. I like the line they put down and that the ink doesn't smear when my hand moves across the page (I'm left-handed).There are two issues I have with the Sharpie Pens, though. The first one is the flaking of the barrel. The silver finish on the barrel flakes off and goes everywhere. It is all over the inside of the pen pocket in my backpack, it gets on my hands and face, and it gets on my paper. This is annoying, but I am willing to live with it because the pens write nicely.The second problem is the leaking. This is the problem that takes these pens to a 1-star rating for me. I didn't have any problems in the winter, but the weather here just warmed up and all of my Sharpie Pens began to leak on the same day. The ink leaks all over my hands and my desk. I had to throw the whole lot of them away. These were my favorite pens, but I can't have pens that only work during cold months. I will be looking elsewhere for my new go-to pen.",0,0
R2YMMWLVLMBFG,"I should have read the other reviews more closely... Love the fine tip, but no ink comes out! They worked great the first time, and now it seems they are dried out or do not work when writing horizontally on a wall. I only used the pink one a couple times and now it doesn't write at all. These were a waste of money and I will never buy again. So disappointed.",0,0
R3LDU5TG4S5N3Y,"Update: B504 errorI bought these because, well, Canon ink is too expensive. I read the reviews, and I also believed, naively, the advertising that said the product had colors that would look just like the original ink. The black is reasonably dark, but the colors are washed out compared to the original cartridges. The Canon ink has a rich, organic look. The ink does not dry as fast as the original, either. Having said that, there's not a lot of chemical smell from the Kingway ink, and the colors are not as bad as some replacement cartidges I have used. So, perfectly fine, but don't expect great color.",0,0
R17324341M1GOP,"I had previously given a similar review and the company in there attempt to console me sent me 2 more small plastic baggies with not ""4-Strips"" as it says but 3 and these are 1 - 3/8"" long. They are the heavy duty 3M type of Velcro strip but again, who would knowingly buy 3 small strips??? Not me. And to send me 2 tiny bags of 3 and not 4 as the ad says........By the way, thank you for the additional strips and the feeble attempt change my review, I am simply being honest. Nothing wrong with selling 3 little strips but make that really clear in your advertisement and don't say ""4-Strips"" and then send only 3. Not ok.",0,0
R2I0HM6JMA5XB4,"I've been experiencing the dreaded symptoms of carpal tunnel & decided I needed to quickly remedy the situation.  I've just been using a regular, cheap, mouse pad without any padding.  I like to simplify, so after carefully reading over the reviews, chose this product.  It arrived today, & I'm telling you the truth, my wrist was on it for mere minutes when it began aching & burning.  The padding is just too hard, not at all soft like the advertisement said--the rolled sock I'd been using felt better.  And I was disappointed that the platform was some sort of hardwood that prevented the mouse from rolling smoothly. I'm sending it back for a refund.",0,0
RXM1SU39D95WC,"These markers have bold colors and write very well, but they are not washable and have limited color palette.

Sad, because no other markers have such strong colors with low odor, but until these issues change, 2 stars.",0,0
R3UO1Z4C6FNVSM,I use the scales to weigh pen pal letters. I originally gave these scales a good review.  It has now turned totally bad.  I have not been able to use the scales after the first use.  The digital display has went crazy.  It will not zero out.,0,0
R10THJHAQNZHKW,"Basically painful to sit in for more than an hour after the first 10 hours of use. Backing mesh stretched and lumbar support is not padded. After one day of use, you will need to tuck a pad or foam into the seat, like other reviewers have noted, or you will have a hard plastic “lumbar” support that is sharp in your back.Within a six months all of the foam was flattened in the arm rests and then the arms themselves will start to back out of the assembly and wobble around. After six months of wobbling they break off.This is not a good product and I would not recommend it to anyone.",0,0
R23Q6UFG471L78,"I very seldom write a review but I must admit I do read them on products. These print cartridges are a 50/50 crap shoot, the first ones I got worked fine the next order they would only print a very faint image of the picture and black print and before you ask no these were not used and re-boxed. I emailed GPC and got a reply telling me to clean the contacts with a eraser and send them the Amazon order #, I had already cleaned the Ink ports with their included alcohol cleaning pad.  I did all that GPC asked and still the same faint picture and letters I emailed them back and said that it was still the same, I waited for a reply for almost a week and GPC never replied again. To add salt to the wound of this order I bought them for $24.95 and Amazon only credited me $19.99. So think about the time to mess around defective ink cartridges, the GPC email failure, taking them back to UPS and loosing $5.00, do yourself a favor and by another brand.",0,0
REDFWUT5TLJAT,"I bought this item because it received a lot of good reviews. It is comfortable and does not generate much heat, but perhaps this item is just not for me.

R1WMA3U2RG83Y9,"Made in China/Japan and the quality shows this time around. As an avid ""pen person"" I have to admit that this pen us very cheaply made, its cartridges difficult to load and when depressed to write, most of the colors don't stay down low ng enough to write and pop back up.Unfortunately I relyed on the previous rave reviews I read but I will not purchase these ever again!

There's no way to remove the glue, it's solid. It's a shame. They're the perfect length and erase well. However, it's pretty expensive when you end up with only one good one. As for recommending? I'd say, it's a coin toss. Maybe you'll get two good ones, or maybe you'll pay this price and only get one that's useful. Unless they're deliberately trying to get rid of a stock of errors in manufacturing, surely every order wouldn't contain one flawed & one usable eraser?

RBSMSIIZEKKMQ,"I bought this based on a suggestion from a friend that swears by his. Setup was easy but, it works only part of the time. I insert a document and then most of the time I have to reinsert the document because I am getting the no paper detected alert. Even though that is a pain, the software is easy to use and I can work with it. The software wants you to purchase a cloud plan to backup and enable features on the iphone app. I don't care about cloud backup or iphone features, because I use the scanner to report incoming checks and record expenses at my desk in my office and backup to an external hard drive. I did not extend the paid plan support after the trial has ended. I even have to opt out of the many reminder emails from Neat which is quite annoying. Now here comes the part that makes me angry: My older macbook pro dies. I have a backup of my neat software from my external hard drive and I think I'm in the clear. I buy a new macbook and install the neat software but when I log into the new software and enter my old login info, It says my Neat plan has expired. It seems my only choice... is to purchase a cloud plan from Neat and I am unable to open the program and can't get past the log in / purchase a plan screen. I take a few breaths, let's work the problem. I go to the Neat website and guess what?!!! I can not call for support, because you have to pay for extended service nor can I live chat with someone because (you guessed it) you have to pay for extended service. I will email the support link, it is free surprisingly.I would not recommend this unless you are willing to buy an expensive scanner then continue to pay for the honor of using the Neat software and pay additionally for customer support other than by email.I am giving this 2 stars because it will work and the software is easy to use, but I am not recommending this because of the lack of unpaid customer support and seeming greediness of the Neat company.

RNYE41MVP6LXT,"I dislike giving negative reviews, but one of the main criteria I use when deciding on a purchase are the ratings provided by other customers. So, I think it's only fair to express an honest opinion regarding the items I buy, in the event it helps someone else. The greeting cards I received after placing this order are disappointing. In the photos provided, the reindeer appears to be red. On the actual card, the color is a dull burgundy (and I realize computer monitors can affect this aspect). I missed the fact that the texture is glossy, as it looks more parchment-like in the image and this was entirely my oversight. The description indicates the cards are printed on heavy stock. At best, this is medium-grade. Overall, the impression these cards give is similar to that of some I saw recently at the local Dollar Store. And, those were priced significantly less. Just not good quality merchandise.",0,0

RXKKJQEA8WIXL,"This is the only bad review I've ever had to write. The company I work for bought this printer for me. If I would have looked into it myself, I would have seen the bad reviews for this model and selected something different. Setup was easy. Printer worked for a couple months then black clogged. Cleaning solved the issue for a couple weeks, then it occurred again. I went through several cartridges while repeating cleaning cycles (which consumes a lot of ink) and it never got much better. And, ink can only be ordered online - not available at Best Buy, Office Depot, or anywhere I looked. I was then shipped a replacement machine, but continued to have the same problems. Ink constantly leaking and creating a mess.

I bought a certified HP replacement cartridge to try to fix the issue, but the printer head magenta was completely blocked up.  I bought a printer head cleaning kit to fix it - managed to unblock the magenta - but the printer head isn't printing correctly.  Finally managed to get everything straightened to test again, and now the cartridges are depleted.  After only printing about a dozen pages.  Regret buying these so much...  You can save 70 dollars off a full set of certified HP ink, but then you'll have to spend 200 on a new printer head for a printer that doesn't cost much more than that to begin with.Incredibly disappointing, huge waste of money, I saw some bad reviews and took a chance anyway.

The print quality is very low and it has constant technical problems (e.g, I just spent the past hour on the phone with Epson because the machine would only print blank pages).  Even when the product is under warranty, Epson will not allow you to return the item for a refund, so if problems start happening after Amazon's 1-month return policy, you're out of luck.

RUXQPB6RCP5IO,"I wanted to replace my over 20 year old telephone table from back in the days when all phones were wired. I really like the look of this table, but reading the reviews I knew this was going to be a hit or miss purchase. Even some reviewers that gave positive reviews had some issues. I figured I'll take a chance and give it a shot. Well it was a miss for me. There were some minor issues with the finish but they were not that noticeable if you were not looking for them. Some people say the table is flimsy. I disagree. The wood is pretty heavy and it's sturdy. The instructions are basically just diagrams, but not too difficult to figure out. The main problem is with the workmanship. Some of the parts do not align properly. Some parts are probably not cut to the correct size. I'm the guy people come to to put stuff together so I know how to do this. Rarely do I run into something where the fit and finish is so bad. My biggest problem was that the front legs where the bottom shelf connected were too far apart. There was a gap where you could see the wood dowels between the legs and the shelf. Because of that, the drawer would not fit properly. The rails on the side panels were too far apart for the grooves on the drawer. So the drawer would just fall to the floor. I read reviews with the opposite problem of the drawer being too tight. There is no contact number for the company that sell this in the paperwork, only a fax number to order missing parts. I did find the number via Google. They were friendly but had no solutions. If for the fact that I don't want to take this thing apart and try to stuff it all back in that box, it would be going back to Amazon. And I really do like the look. So I jerry rigged it so the drawer would stay in by connecting two 24"" zip ties together and pulling the side panels closer together. It doesn't look pretty and I'm disappointed I had to do it but it worked. Maybe I'll think of a better solution later on. Anyway the pictures will show how I resolved the problem. Only reason I don't give it 1 star is because it looks so much nicer than the table it replaces.",0,0

R1HUD6TBM07ON0,"Great printers while they last. Expect to buy a new one every year. Disposable. Expensive ink.Update: 07/27/2017I've changed my rating from 3 stars to 1 star because I have had nothing but trouble out of this (2nd one) Epson WorkForce WF-3620. The print heads clog constantly, quality of output is unacceptable, it constantly drops off the network and for some reason it prints random lines (like an EKG) through-out the print. The reason I bought this 2nd one is because we had just bought so much new ink ($150 worth) for the 1st one in anticipation of it being around a while. That was just before that one started giving us trouble. We used up that new ink with this 2nd printer and then stupidly bought $150 more thinking the 2nd printer would last. It gave us 6 months of good use but now it is going out like the 1st one and we have new ink just sitting there. I will not buy another one of these junk printers.

R20S3UAWISN4D9,"I really like the look of these pens. I got one from a dollar store and gave it to my granddaughter. She loved it and uses it all the time. Then my grandson wanted one so I looked to amazon. I saw this set of 8. They look exactly like the one I had. Despite the multitude of negative reviews, which mostly reported gems falling out and things I felt I could fix, I made the purchase. The pens came with all gems attached and I thought all was good. I gave one to my grandson and another to my granddaughter. After a few minutes my granddaughter was asking what that was on the floor. It looked like a giant beetle, but upon closer examination, it was a blob of ink that had been stepped on. It was all over the place. On the couch, all over the floor, on my pants, and the kids feet and clothes. I found it had poured out of the bottom of the pen I gave my granddaughter - the new one from this pack. I confiscated the one I gave to my grandson and quarantined them in the bag they came in. I don't trust them and will probably discard the entire package. The good news is that the ink did come out of almost everything. The suede couch still has stains on it, but we do not have a cleaner to use on it yet.

R3638KM29NMXPB,"My rating is primarily for the Epson customer support.  When I purchased the WF-3620, I was looking for an all-in-one with OCR capabilities like my previous HP all-in-one.  I searched the product information on Amazon and on the Epson website and couldn't establish whether or not this new version included that software.  The previous version, WF-3520, included ABBYY FineReader OCR software.  I CALLED EPSON and their representative assured me that the WF-3620 did indeed include the ABBYY FineReader software but you have to use the downloaded software to install, not the included disk.  That is not true.  To make a very long and frustrating story filled with wrong information short, this newer version DOES NOT INCLUDE OCR SOFTWARE.SET UP--Initially set up was easy and straightforward.  We wirelessly connected a Mac desktop, a Windows desktop and a Windows laptop directly from the Epson website.  Printed fine that day and the next.  Three days later, I couldn't print from either desktop; don't know about the laptop.  And the scanner didn't work either (and I didn't try but I don't think it worked with the initial set up).  The initial response from the support fix the problem was sending me the same instructions to install that came with the unit, which I already did.  After speaking with 3 other support reps and going through some procedures that were not intuitive, I finally have the Mac printing and scanning working.  I had to delete everything from the Windows desktop and am currently trying to reinstall from the Epson website (which I'm told is down at the moment for maintenance, ""Please check back in a few hours."")As for how it functions, scanning and printing are fairly fast.

R3TX3ONJ4QAY92,"So I bought the lime green one at my local office supply super store thinking all cute dispensers were created equal.  Unfortunately, this one was a disappointment.  The biggest problem I have with it is that when you pull up to peel off tape (and I'm not even talking about a 12-noon angle here, I mean just any kind of up), the whole roll and core pop out of the dispenser and must be replaced before one can carrrrefully extract tape from this thing.  And this is not a sometimes kind of thing.  This happens every freakin time I use the dispenser.  Because I'm stubborn and refused to take it back to the store, I just taped (irony!) some pieces of cardboard over the grooves where the dispenser sits so that it can no longer come out.  Of course, I have to destroy this every time the tape runs out, but otherwise the dispenser would be almost unusable.The other issue that I have is that I don't think it's heavy enough, but that is from a preference standpoint, I think, and less of a universal issue.  Sadly, though, instead of using one hand to grab tape, pull up, and dispense as needed, one must use two hands for the dispenser, pull at a zero degree angle, and dispense as needed.  That pretty much rules out gift wrapping, poster hanging, or any other one-hand-is-holding-this-thing-together activities.  It's a shame, because this thing is really extremely adorable and looks great, enough to get it two stars even!  But I'm really disappointed with it, and until they redesign it, I wouldn't recommend buying it.",0,0

HP support solution doesn't work because it assumes you have already setup the printer.  So you are left with 2 options, they will replace it (at an additional cost), or they will order a new printhead and ship it to you (at an additional cost).  If something doesn't work out of the box, huge red flag.  Won't by another HP product again.",0,0

R1JMAXJAEHCYVH,"I thoroughly enjoy writing with this pencil, but I have had the same disappointing experience regarding lifespan as has been noted by several other reviewers. Mine lasted just short of three weeks before the inner barrel shattered, leaving the pencil useless. The pencil, therefore,did not last nearly as long as one of the $ 0.99 Bic's that I can by by the Gross at Office Depot, and still come out money ahead. The plastic part which failed is very flimsy and it is no surprise to me that it failed.

R3RUNFIPQ5OIP3,"Loved it for 6 months. Scanner is great, wifi features are great. Then it just starts printing huge blurry horizontal lines. I cleaned heads sooo many times. Ran horizontal and vertical adjustments, replaced cartridges. Went through every single action from Customer Support...was left with a garbage printer. Google this issue - it is insanely common with this specific printer. There is a workaround - print everything on super saturated setting which uses 2-3x the amount of ink. Strange a printing company that also makes printer cartridges would make a printer that is only usable with a setting that uses 2-3x the regular amount of ink or force the owner to purchase a new printer. There is a reason Epson has a Consumer Affairs rating of 1.1 out of 5.",0,0
R3VG5PSP5FLL5D,"I ordered this for my Lexmark X6150 which is an older printer but the website stated that it is compatible.  So, naturally, I placed an order and received it yesterday.  I went to go print something off of the computer and when I did, it asked me to install a cartridge.I did everything from cleaning the cartridge itself to cleaning the part where it holds the actual cartridge inside the printer.  Nothing happened.  I even tried to switch sides, making sure it was installed properly and what do you know, I still had the same results.Boy was I in for a surprise.  I should have read the 1-star reviews for this product before purchasing it.  The thing WILL NOT WORK, even when I tried making a copy, nothing came out but a blank piece of paper.So, for those if you thinking about getting this cartridge, beware:  It will more than likely NOT work with your printer.  Plus, there's either some Chinese/Japanese wording on the side (like in the picture above) that states ""not for customer use"", whatever that means.Now I'm stuck with a faulty cartridge and cannot return it seeing as how I already opened the packaging materials and tried using it in my printer.

R2NO3J4WKZ29ZQ,"I'm constantly mad at this printer. It's gotten to the point where I just don't print things anymore. It worked fine when I first got it, the setup was easy, and it started working quickly - there wasn't a lot of steps, basically. But then I moved. For some reason trying to connect the printer to a new network caused a huge meltdown - not only to the printer, but also to my computer. It was a disaster. For awhile any time I turned the printer on the who wifi network would go down. So I figured out how to hardwire it to stop that happening. It's definitely not as convenient as the wireless printing, but I figured it was better than no printing. Now I turn the wifi on my laptop off before I turn the printer on, then I plug in the USB cord and print. Which works about half the time. The other half of the time, my computer can't locate the printer and it refuses to do anything. Just now I successfully printed one document, moved over to the next one, only to have it be refused despite all the various efforts, workarounds and restarts I could think of, which is what prompted this review. I really wanted to like this printer, I had heard really good things about it, but so far my experience has not been pretty frustrating. I do get the feeling this is just a weird circumstance - something random went wrong somewhere and threw everything else off. All the same, I paid $100 and still don't really have printing capabilities, so that's annoying.",0,0

R147VRBVTXED2E,"I really had a lot of fun trying this out in the store.  It highlighted printed text on many surfaces great.  So I purchased it.  It glides smoothly acros the paper and has a great, bright, color.Now for the downside of the review.... I mainly use highlighters to highlight handwritten notes on notebook paper.  All it did was smear it into a smudged mess!  I even waited an hour for it to dry and it still smudged the handritten ink!  Then I tried different types of inks; ballpoint pen, gel pen, rollerball, etc.  The worst was the gel pen, TERRIBLE!!!!  The best was the ball point but it still smudged more than if I had used a traditional highlighter.As noted by other reviewers, it is somewhat like a crayon and I will agree.  With that in mind, as with a crayon, to get a good solid line you have to go over the same line twice or very heavily to get a good color transfer.  I believe that because I had to go over my notes several times to get a good bright highlight color with this ""highlighter"" could be the reason I had so much smearing.I guess it's a toss-up.  You can get either a fun new type of highlighter that won't dry out; but highlights only certain types of ink without smudging with a very light color application in an unpredictable location without crisp start, end, top, or bottom lines of highlight.  Or, you can have a fun new type of highlighter that won't dry out; but creates a huge smudgy mess if you want a decent color transfer without crisp start, end, top or bottom lines of highlight.The choice is up to you, but for me, I think I am going to stick with a traditional hihglighter and wait until the Gimmick is improved before I try iy again!",0,0

R3GRIOLIKE80Z6,HORRIBLE PRODUCT!!! Would give this negative stars if possible! I purchased a stuffed animal that had similar coloring to a dog that passed away recently in my family thinking this fabric sharpie could fill in some of the differences in markings on the dog. NOPE! First time I used this almost all the black turned white or pale gray after washing it on delicate cycle in cold water. Tried coloring everything again thinking really making sure I saturated the fabric/fur and then hand washing it in cold water. This time the coloring bled everywhere turning white fur dingy and the black STILL FADED!!! I’m irate!!! This horrible marker completely destroyed this stuffed animal! This was supposed to be a “memorial” for my parents deceased dog for my 3 year old daughter who absolutely loved him.

My Large Print Life Application Bible measures 6"" x 9"" x 2"".  According to the online product sizing description and the product hang-tag that came attached to the Bible cover, this size Large cover fits Bibles exactly like mine up to 6 5/8"" x 9 1/2"" x 2"". Seemed perfect. Here are the actual measurements of the size Large Bible cover that I received: (outside measurements) 8"" x 11"" x 2""; (inside measurements) 7 1/4"" x 10 1/2"" x 2"". The cover is so large that when I place my Bible inside it and open it up to reading position, the back cover of my Bible slips entirely out of the Bible protective cover. When zipped into the cover, my Bible slides up and down against the internal surface of the zipper and cover which will obviously cause wear and tear on the front and back book covers. Preventing wear and tear was the point of purchasing a Bible cover in the first place. So, this Bible cover is packed back into its box and is being returned to Amazon post haste.

Let me say that WeighMax has EXCELLENT customer service, they were polite and very fast to address my problems and gave me no arguments about sending out replacement scales.The problem is this.  WeighMax sent out a replacement scale for my original purchase.  This scale came with a battery that only had 6V and would not function, however on using a new battery or plugging it into AC power would work, however it only weighed in oz/lb - the button that should have switched it to g/kg wouldn't work.  I let WeighMax know this and although they said they  ""test all scale before we ship out. Maybe something happened during the shipping"", they sent me a replacement (the third scale) without any argument.  This third scale also came with a battery that only had 6V in it and would not function.  On using a fresh battery and subsequently the AC adapter, I got a variety of error codes on turning the scale on and finally the scale would turn on for an instant then immediately turn off.I have let WeighMax know that this third scale is defective and I suspect they will make things right somehow, but I must say that after all this nonsense, I've lost faith in the product.-------(original review)Can tare, weigh in kg/g or lbs/oz. has a reasonably sized platform.  I've used it mainly to weigh backpacking and climbing gear.  Obtained repeatable weights, although I did not check it against another scale to help determine accuracy.

RWJVGPSJOX4K3,"(Updated July 2016): I bought this is December 2015, and by now (July 2016), the pen is leaking, so before I can use it, I have to wipe it down and clean it of the leaked ink. My other Platinums don't do that. So I did get 7-8 months' worth of use out of this, but I'm very disappointed that it's broken.Old review: I really, really like this pen. I went with the ""medium"" nib which is a lot finer than any European medium nib I've ever written with, but I soon got used to it. Ink flow (I'm writing with Platinum's ink) is good, on the wet side for me, but it dries quickly enough to not send this lefthander into ""smudge hell"". It's on the light side for what I like (I have a collection of steel pens at home because I like the weight), but I found that the longer I write with it, it ""vanishes"" in my hand in a good way. Using it feels quite natural, and the plastic is sturdy and can take some abuse (I don't go easy on my pens, even the nice ones). Delivery was great and fast. In terms of size, I have medium-sized hands, so I would NOT want this to get any smaller or slimmer, but the length and diameter work surprisingly well for me, even unposted.

It worked great for awhile and then it started having problems such as it going out of alignment and using ink faster than I could keep up with. The final straw was today when I got a 0x97 error code, which basically means the logic board needs to be replaced and the printer no longer works at all. Of course, the warranty ran out one month ago.  Repairs would be more expensive than buying a new one, so I am looking once again at printers. Before this printer we had an HP printer for years and years that worked great. When it finally gave out we read reviews looked at the cost per page for new printers and did quite a bit of research before we bought this one. Buying this printer was a mistake. I will be buying an HP again.",0,0
R217NZT3BWPKK7,"I've never written a review, but I must say two things...first off...Amazon.com itself has been great about making this right by immediately refunding me the entire purchase price plus shipping and is sending a return label.The problem is the cartridge.  I make sure I specifically order NEW Lexmark cartridges because I've found refurbished ones normally don't work in Lexmark printers.  My husband installed the new cartridge only for our printer to say it was missing a cartridge.  I removed it, and tried several more times.  Installed the old empty cartridge & it printed a very light page...it was almost empty & the reason we ordered a new one.  Looked at the new cartridge & notice that it has a yellow ""Not for customer Use!"" lable with lots of Chinese writing also....not the typical 82 Black label.  The foil package also has a computer printer generated label over 8L0220, so it's not a new original Lexmark 82 cartridge...I shook it & it sounds empty.  WHAT A RIP OFF!!!!!  I WILL NEVER PURCHASE FROM THIS SELLER AGAIN.....BEWARE!!!!!!!",0,0

RJFJTBK7OFW48,"I had to come back to turn in a very poor performance on this retractable ink joyI had to come back to review the poor performance/failure of my retractable ink joy pens (set of 8).  I was so surprised by the product repeated failure - and the company response.  Within a month of use, the green ink gathered between the retracted tip and translucent  barrel and created blotches when trying to write.  I contacted the company, they requested I send back the pen in a padded envelope (so they could research failure) and they sent a replacement pen a month later, not convenient but ok response.  By the time the replacement arrived, another pen had failed in the same way and within 5 months a total of four of the 8 pens have failed (two remaining pens have not been used/still have tip seal on them).  I emailed customer service (3 failed pens, orange, turquoise and the new green) and got the same request to wrap up and ship them back- sorry not interested in taking my time and $ to ship defective product back again.  I have not had any problem with their removable cap model of ink joy- but they are not as quick for jotting a note with.  The positive- the colors are cool and when the pens are working they are very fluid and smooth- hence the two stars.  All in, I will not buy again.  I will also say I store the retractable and the removable cap pens vertical, in a pencil cup, but I would hope that is not the limiting factor for successful use.",0,0

The only reason I'm giving two stars is because some aren't quite as awful as others, but they are pretty much all terrible.

Everytime I've tried to write one complete sentence most of the words have at least one or two letters that just didn't show up. The pens themselves are weird and don't always write, and after a couple of months they have started leaking ink everywhere. These are unfortunately going in the trash",0,0

R2J1U2Y4CQ2D24,"Unfortunately the ink cartridge didn't work. I haven't bought remanufactured ink for my HP Officejet 4500 printer before, but I have for other printers and have never had a problem.

The printer started flashing an error message and keeping saying to shutdown the printer, but then it had problems starting up again. I put the old HP ink back in and everything was fine. Just to test things again I put the remanufactured ink back in and things went crazy again.I can't say if I was just unlucky with a bad cartridge or not, but the cartridge I received did NOT work.

R1IUZM0JEKQBEX,"Usually these have worked fine up till my last purchase. First it told my ink was expired, than a couple colors we leaking so bad that I had to pull my whole printer apart for a clean up but it was too late. The ink recognization circuit was shorted on the two that was leaking. Have the ink but threw out my printer. Also I am not a novice when it comes to electronic devices of any kind, went to school for it. Never a problem til this time. Like anything it only takes once. It was a very good printer and very expensive. Is was all in one but as far as photo prints, it was amazing. What stinks is I'm on dissablty now and I don't know how I can afford a good photo printer like that AGAIN. Like I said I bought lots of that ink on line and had no problems. Like I said too, it only took two faulty cartridges. Sorry for the review but I need to be honest. I appreciate the fact of getting ink for a fraction of the store price, this time just costed me all my purchase saving plus. Nick",0,0
RH0KB4VCXE8CR,"Very nice mouse pad, especially for the price. You can't really go wrong with this pad- it helps relieve pressure from your wrist so you're less likely to get hand cramps or have your hand fall asleep. It's a convenient size too so that it'll nicely fit on your desk without forcing you to make more room for it. The little bump out on the left of the pad aids in the natural movements of the mouse so you will be able to use your mouse without falling off of the pad. The bottom has a slightly sticky rubber to keep the pad in place on your desk but will not leave any residue. If you need a mousepad with some gel wrist support for a good cost, you won't be disappointed with this one. JETech has always come through with simple and cost effective products for people who need something and don't have specific demands- great for offices.UPDATE: I've had this mousepad for longer than a year but with less than average use. Like other reviewers' pads it has come undone at the bottom with the gel coming out. I can no longer recommend this mousepad. It was really nice while it lasted, but I can't say it was for as long as I expected.",0,0

R1BVAOOW9JGDDJ,"If you need just the occasional paper trimming, this cutter will do the job. This unit is EXTREMELY light weight, the plastic thin and it has nowhere near the sturdiness or heft of other Fiskar paper trimmers (the rotary styles). Also, the swing arm that has measurements on it is difficult to read accurately; because it is not even with the ""bed"" of the unit, the paper being cut actually 'floats' about 1/8 inch above the measurement scale, making it harder to accurately read where you are. I attempted to cut an 8 1/2 inch X 11 inch sheet of paper exactly in half...the shadow cast by the paper and the fact that the paper is not lying directly on top of the scale put the cut off by 1/8""-1/16"". The cutter itself worked beautifully, giving a crisp, clean edge.I can see what others have reported about the cutter potentially abraiding the guide wire - it sounds like a violin string when I shunt the cutter head back and forth, from the vibrations of the wire (I haven't used it enough to experience what some have...the wire breaking completely). If you decide to get this unit, I'd recommend that you be sure to press DOWN on the cutter head, not putting any lateral pressure on it, so it is less likely to rub so hard against the guide wire.Years ago I purchased a full-size Fiskars rotary paper cutter; it's substantially heavier than this unit, has a full-sized graph-scored bed and a rotary blade. I find the insert cutting mat portion of the trimmer dulls the blades quickly and needs replacing often. It is, however, amazingly accurate in measuring for cuts. It is also harder to store, more awkward to get out for a few quick paper cuts and does not transport well. This unit being reviewed is compact enough that it could be kept handy in a desk drawer (a long desk drawer...you'll need a little over 15"" depth), but be careful not to store other, heavy items on top of it. The plastic is light enough that too much weight or stress on it could easily break the plastic or the cutter arm. The cutter does a good job cutting through a single or a couple sheets of paper or tag board, but you may need to measure with a separate ruler and mark the cut line.Bottom line: if you have a need for LOTS of paper trimming, get a heavier cutter. If you only occasionally cut a few sheets and would like something small enough to be kept handy plus you appreciate the price difference (larger rotary models are now running over $50, compared to about $17 for this unit), then this model may do well enough. 2 1/2 stars.",0,0
R2U7UMUEESQQR7,"I bought these pens from a store, but I felt the need to submit a review here.  I love Pilot pens, my mother always used them in the office and I used them when I was a secretary too.  Absolutely loved them!  So, when I found these great, comfortable looking pens, I had to buy a package of them.  I have been using them since the beginning of December.  I loved them so much I bought another package of them.  They wrote wonderfully when I first bought them.  Now, two months later, one of my pens is writing horribly.  I thought it was already out of ink.  Nope.  When I unscrewed it to take a look at my ink level, I realized that only about 1/3 of the ink was gone.  So, I wasted a chunk of money on some ""fine"" pens only to realize that they die within two months or after 1/3 of the ink is gone.  What a rip off!  If I buy Pilot pens again, it will be the ones that are not fancy or more expensive!",0,0
R35GMLHHLAN0CT,"I was very excited when I ordered this pen, being a huge space nerd. In fact, the one additional star I gave the pen is due to my space sentimentality. But when it arrived, my hopes, much like a launch scheduled during inclement weather, were quickly grounded. It doesn't write well unless a significant amount of constant pressure was applied, and even then, it writes intermittently. It is also very loud, making a clicking sound each time it comes off the paper, which is not ideal in an otherwise quiet classroom.I regret spending $9.00 on this pen, as I've had better results using a bic pen (which costs about $0.09 when bought in bulk, 1/100th the price). For $9.00, this pen is absolutely not worth it. Unless you are going to space, writing underwater frequently, or writing upside down, I strongly recommend purchasing a different one.",0,0

R1YGB8FRGGS8RS,"I received the laptop desk today and while I was excited about this purchase initially, it fell short of my expectations. I think the overall idea and concept of the desk is great; however, there needs to be some fine tuning when it comes to the details.The USB cord on the fan is way too short. Like some reviews have indicated, the cord doesn't even reach any of the sides, so this aspect of the laptop desk is useless unless you buy a USB extension cord.Some of the surfaces need extra sanding. On the desk I received, the desk legs were still rough and the stopper for the laptop that connects in the front gave me splinters from just trying to take it out of the cubby compartment. The main surface is fine, but if you end up needing to move the desk around, there's no doubt that you can end up with splinters on your hands.Overall, the desk is sturdy and its easy to fold to store away. Yes, it is all bamboo; however, for the price, I expected better QA and a working fan that can be used out of the box without needing to purchase additional dongles.

R3HI1KKEAGY7RL,"I haven't tested my scanner yet so I'm keeping my fingers crossed but my review is on the way my machine was recieved.  The scanner was in it's original epson box (no outer protective box) with no seal or taping making the box easy to access at anytime in the shipping process.  There was a 5 inch piece of tape over the box flap that appeared to be from UPS  as it said to ""Stop and inspect before opening"".  Unfortunately my landlord signed and I was unable to send back directly.  So when opening the box the lid and base were wrapped seperately  but not sealed.  The only thing actually sealed like you would think when coming from the company was the manual that had tape to seal closed.  I have always ordered my computer equipment online and had it shipped.  Everything always comes taped up shut  and pretty inclusive.  I feel like I could easily wrap up everything the way I found it (since there was no tape involved) and send it  back today.  Maybe this is normal for epson?  I will contact Amazon to see if they would like the machine back or have me test it.  It was a pretty expensive piece of equipment not to have it appropriately packaged.  If the box itself had been sealed I would feel better about it not being tampered with or missing something.",0,0

This was purchased and put into use in the middle of May(2016). It survived for less than 2 months. The raised wrist rest has split open, exposing sticky gel.

R17X8P49CUELNM,"Although it prints fast, the color pics I printed were not as good as the cheapest Dell inkjet I have. But the reason I could not rate this printer above a 1 is because of the way that Brother forces you to buy all of the color cartridges just to be able to use the printer once their ink is low or out if you make the mistake or removing a color cartridge. I felt like I was being held from being able to print my tax returns until I purchased new cartridges. I realize there are ""hacks"" online to get around some of these issues but none worked for me. I first purchased a black cartridge since I really only needed Black for now. I made sure it was genuine Innobella. One I replaced it, still same crappy print job. I following instructions from Brother to select gray-scale in the preferences, clean the jets, etc. Didn't work either. Unplugged it etc. Then I made the mistake of removing one of the color cartridges to shake it hoping to fool the sensors since they ask you to shake the new ones before installation. When I replaced the cartridge, it would no longer recognize the cartridge. At that point it would no longer print unless I could fix that error. Worked all day on ""hacks"" until I finally broke down and ordered another set of color cartridges from Amazon,  I made sure they was genuine Innobella. Thankfully I received them in two days to get my returns printed. However print quality is still not good even after cleaning the jets three times. I would never buy another Brother product again because this issue cost me almost $100 of money I didn't have to spend this month with still inferior print jobs.",0,0

R2SG54WJNKRFKX,"First off, I don't ever want to be the person to give a poor review, but I was so disappointed with these. I really wanted to love these. I loved the way they look online and they were perfect for my nautical themed baby shower cards, but in person, the color was off. Way off. They all had a purple/bluish tint to them, like the printer wasn't calibrated when they were printed (see photos of actual cards next to card package and the white they should have been). I was in a time crunch to get these out, and didn't have time to find or order a new set, so I went with them, however because of the hue I could only use two of the six designs (anchor - being all blue, and the rope as it was harder to tell the white was tinted).

For the price, I used what I could from this set and some older thank you cards I had that didn't match, and will throw the rest out. Such a bummer.",0,0

First printer was supposed to be sent back in the 2nd printer box.  Now they wanted me to return the first and second printer and they would send me a third printer.  And that was their only answer!After MUCH discussion with customer service and the Customer Relations supervisor in the background telling him what to say, and much repeating about send the first printer back, and even ""then we will see what we can do about the second printer"".!

I see a lot of positive reviews listing them as ""cheap"" and that's one thing I agree with.Pens don't come much cheaper than this, and it shows in the quality of the product. They seem to dry/clog up instantly, and it is impossible to maintain a train of thought with there constant ineptitude, grinding the gears to a halt.What's worse is that once one of these pestilent pens calls it quits, there's nothing you can do with the abomination except throw it away. Thus, the cheaply made pen is purchased at an inflated rate, performs cheaply, and then makes it's most prominent impact on the world--not as a writing device, but as another poisonous piece of plastic, sent to join a landfill or float in an ocean: either way, rotting the earth.The Bic Round Stic pen is the cancer that keeps on giving; I wouldn't wish this junk product on my worst enemy, and I encourage anyone interested in giving this shameful company any money for this, or another, disposable piece of garbage to strongly reconsider and fork up the extra dough to purchase something that is made with actual quality.There are a lot of places these pens can be shoved, but they only belong in one dark, smelly hole--and it ain't a landfill.",0,0

R3MBJRAVGY2OLX,"Stay FAR AWAY from this printer!  All the negative reviews here are 100% correct!  This is the WORST INKJET PRINTER LINE ever to come out of any company in Japan in the last decade!  EPSON should be ASHAMED and should be forced to RECALL this entire line!!!  There should be a CLASS ACTION SUIT against them for all customers who have lost money and time using these workforce machines (3620, 3640, 7610, 7620, 7110).The entire printer design is FLAWED!  The ""high-tech"" PrecisionCore printhead with pico sized droplets sounds great UNTIL IT CLOGS which is often!  Then if you do enough printer cleans and it still doesn't work, the ink will backup and flow right into the printhead electronics and burn out the printhead cable or short the printhead out!!!  This is a seriously flawed design and Epson knows it.This is not to mention the fact that these printhead cleanings use up a ton of ink and Epson wants to force you to use only their ink which should be illegal anyways.  It is anti-competitive and this business practice should also be challenged in court!  They are purposely blocking 3rd party ink carts in their firmware.If you run out of ANY color, you can't print black even if you have tons of black or anything for that matter!  Ludicrous.If there is an ANY ERROR with the printer, you can't use the scanner anymore or do anything other than be forced to pay them for service!  They should be sued for this one as well.  This is a big SCAM of a printer here!Not to mention the waste.  You end up with a huge paperweight of electronics!  What a waste of our Earth's resources on this one!Epson NEEDS TO GET SUED big time.

Committing brand suicide??DON'T BUY ANY WORKFORCE PRINTER FROM EPSON until they go back to the drawing board and start listening to the numerous daily complaints!

Some of the number cards are too large for the slots, or rather, the slots of the pocket chart are not all the same size... Some slots are bigger and some are smaller than others. Also, the pockets at the bottom are meant to fit the extra cards, like the months.... So where does one put them when they are not being used?

R198IMX2T9SBAX,"+4 stars for being a very versatile printer (5), -1 star for going too far trying to enforce use of Epson ink. (4) -3 stars for designing a printer that's too complicated/cheap to last past 1 year or 1-2 ink changes. (1) +1 star for customer service sort of trying to help, and at least paying for shipping of broken printers or bad Epson ink that it can't detect. Bringing us to a fairly poor 2 Star Review.Scans, copies, can print on a large variety of paper types in many different qualities. Easy wi-fi access. The printer is cheap. I would be very happy with this printer if it wasn't for its tendency to clog/stop working and the ridiculous ink practices.Worked great as a home printer for ~8 months, changed the ink cartridges and immediately clog problems began. Auto-cleaning programs worked for another 3 months while HEAVILY wasting ink the entire time. 3rd ink change (much sooner than should be necessary) and one color no longer prints entirely with no help from the auto-cleaning program. The printer is too ""complicated"" to be cleaned at home or have a nozzle replaced so in the end I ship it out for a replacement printer.New printer arrives, and the Epson branded ink that comes with it don't work with the printer. They've designed so many guards against re-fills and off brands that there isn't even work-arounds to their own ink failing the test. If a different ink cartridge doesn't work, then I'll get the joy of shipping out my 2nd printer for a replacement.TLDR: It is cheap, appears great, does lots of amazing things, but it is a lie. It will break, or clog, or cost far more in ink than you ever would have accepted if you'd known.

R14QPAJONF9E93,"I was on the phone every single month at about two hours per call. I cannot make any suggestions for PC users. I can only say that after getting a supervisor who handled my cases specifically it came down to him thinking that this particular model does not work well with Macs. My computer could rarely find the printer; the HP scanner application is a joke. Using your system preferences limits your DPI options; it often prints double-sided against all effort for it not to (choosing the right options); the scanner auto-feed loads documents at an angle; you have to force it to combine pages into a single document. How this printer is a top-seller for home offices is hard to figure out. Another one of those ""Amazon sellers must be fixing the rating"" moments.  Mac users beware. I seriously don't think I've ever hated an inanimate object more than this printer. Every two months the company changes their customer service number, which app is best to use, which drivers are available. In the last month, they said they'd literally give me a deep discount on another printer since this one is so difficult to use with a Mac.  Just don't do it, mac users.",0,0

R1XVZ2YVWF9J5I,"I've had this printer for a couple of years now, and I have to say that I just hate it.  There's a lot of vitriol in this review because I'm currently once again having to troubleshoot some mystery problem of why it won't print.  Reasons I hate it:1 - It CONSTANTLY has to be reinstalled on my PC to work because it's always sending some stupid error message.  It does the same crap on my fiance's PC too, so it's not on the computer end as far as I can tell.  Usually this is after a power blink when the wi-fi resets.  Maybe it has less problems if it's hooked up via USB, but then, why buy a wi-fi printer?2 - You absolutely can't print ANYTHING, even black and white documents, if any of the other color cartridges are out of ink.  You have to keep this thing fully supplied with all types of ink for it to function.  What a scam.3 - The print quality is not great, and there are no options to increase the quality.  I mainly use this print out a lot of science journal articles for school, and the letters and diagrams are usually fuzzy.Sorry this review is a bit rage-y, but if you choose to buy this overpriced hunk of junk and use it for a while, you will understand.",0,0

I have a ream on Georgia Pacific Standard Glossy Photo paper, 200g/m2, 53lb, 9mil that will not feed into the printer. The one sheet that it did pull in got stuck at the first rollers and jammed. I've never owned a printer before that would balk at any paper I tried to put in it so I'm going to give it the benefit of the doubt and buy some HP photo paper to try.

You CAN NOT print in black and white if you are out of even just one of the colored ink cartridges, and it goes through the color cartridges VERY quickly even if you are only printing in black and white.  I've never had a printer that wouldn't allow for grayscale printing.Seriously, if you run out of one or more of the color cartridges and you just want to print off ONE black and white page, not going to happen.

So we purchased the expensive ink this time, NOT remanufactured, and when looking at the ink levels, all brand new color ink cartridges are only half full!!! The black is the only one that is full. We purchased the 3 color inks and the regular black; we didn't need photo black so we didn't get it. Makes me wonder if the seller is selling old ink that has been sitting around drying up. It just sucks when you pay a lot of money and literally do not get everything you paid for. If the color ink cartridges are suppose to be half way full, please let me know. But this has never happened to me before. Next time I'm just going to go to an actual store to purchase ink.

It will stay stuck to the financial plan, but the tab part needs to stick to itself at one part and that's what keeps coming undone.

R2CP8LC5WNK8QA,"This is a review for the Epson 3640 purchased at Costco which is apparently the same model printer.  Those who have given this printer high reviews must not be trying to use the rear feeder and are not using anything other than copy paper.CONS:1.  The rear sheet feeder requires you to first send your print job, then you must run through to the printer to put the paper in (it will only take one sheet at a time which must be hand-fed and this is the only way the printer allows you to print labels or card stock), then you must click buttons on the screen.2.  When using anything other than copy paper (""bright white setting"") we got error messages saying ""there is a mismatch between the printer driver and the paper in the tray,"" which happened repeatedly and was what caused us to return this printer.  Fixing this required resetting everything.Contact with Epson support confirmed it is a glitch.3.  Takes a while to warm up and get going, making lots of noise in the process.4.  It does not claim to be a ""photo"" printer but when I read reviews first, users claimed it did an okay job of photos.  Wrong.  The couple of photos I tried to print were totally un-usable -- fuzzy -- even from a high resolution .jpgPROS:1.  It has two paper trays that hold half a ream each, which sounded like a good idea, but when you read CON #2, you will see why this is moot.2.

I've recommended/purchased/deployed dozens, if not hundreds, over a 20+ career in IT.  Back in 2014 I purchased the bigger version (WF-7620) of this AIO printer for my own home office. Price/features seemed great.  The printer worked for about 6 months, then started having serious printing problems.  I burned through what felt like hundreds of dollars in ink trying to fix it to no avail.  It ended up on the curb for bulk junk pick-up.Since I had more ink for this line of printer, and trying to not leave a brand I was once loyal to, I picked up the WF-3620.  It worked for about the same amount of time, then had the EXACT SAME PROBLEMS with printing.  Epson support was a joke.  I've been limping along with this printer for the past 6 months suffering through sub-standard prints (smudges, poor text quality, etc.) Today I had critical documents that I had to load on a USB drive and bring to kinkos so I could print them in acceptable quality.  That's why I'm on providing this review.  This printer is going on the curb, like it's big brother, along with whatever ink I have left over.

I'm using a relatively standard sized wireless mouse and there's enough real estate on the surface for me to move the mouse from one edge of the screen to the next.

My wife had a similar one (without the fan) that we both enjoy using so it was I got this without hesitating.Pro: The table itself is very sturdy and additional features like locking and fan was a plus. Also with a low price, I would have given it 5 stars.Con: While I was taking out the table, I felt an unexpected jolt in my finger. A splinter from the table had lodged in my finger which came from one of the holes that were drilled in. I guess they didn't shave these parts to prevent something like this.

R2Z8J5GLU3KCV9,"It's definitely as bad as many of the reviews claim! I purchased it on Amazon in September 2016 for light home office duty, but it was having problems well before Christmas - mostly related to print head clogging. Most of the tiny toner cartridge's ink was wasted doing numerous head cleaning procedures while trying to get some sort of legible output from the printer. I've never printed a satisfying document from this printer and for the past 6 months, I've had to work on it for an hour or more every-time I wanted to print a single mailing label. It's been less than 20 months since I purchased it and I've only put 200 pages through it, but I've replaced the toner cartridges three times with OEM ink that cost twice the price of the whole printer. It's a really bad, unreliable, frustrating and amazingly expensive (to operate) printer and if for some strange reason you'd like one, mine's out on the curb in the trash today (where it should have been more than a year ago).",0,0
R8KA23TAUH94E,"I bought this B/Y printhead to fix a problem with my HP OfficeJet Pro L7780 all-in-one.  It's a problem that cannot be fixed.The entire OfficeJet Pro L7700 series is a crate of lemons.  Don't take my word for it: read the USER reviews at amazon.com and cnet.com.If you have an all-in-one or printer from the HP OfficeJet Pro L7700 series, and it tells you that either of your printheads is bad, OR if you have a problem with your all-in-one and HP Support tells you to replace the printhead, DON'T DO IT.  The new printhead may fix the problem for about 50 pages, and then the problem will return -- or a new problem will arise.I'm serious.  Don't waste your money on this.  You will be throwing good money after bad.  For the price of two printheads (which is what you'll end up spending anyway, and two new printheads WILL NOT solve your problem), you can buy a brand new all-in-one from Canon or Lexmark.

Why would I pay $4 for one pack when I could (supposedly) get 3 packs for $6 ?!  Since the history shows I ordered one pack, I can't lodge a complaint.

So I happened to have the wire type connector from a prior printer and figured out how to do that (Connector does not come with it). Then I maybe did color printing about 25 times. Now My CYAN color is clogged and no ink comes out of it. I did their nozzle check, nozzle clean - no Help. So now my printer is JUNK. THANKS EPSON FOR A TOTALLY UNRELIABLE PRINTER. I WASTED ABOUT $100 on the printer and buying new ink about $35 for the ink to see if a new CYAN cartridge would help. SO MONEY DOWN THE DRAIN. GOOD LUCK if you are getting a WF maybe they have gotten better, likely not. Oh wait the black is still working!!! FOR NOW.",0,0
R379V7F9LD5GP1,"While the setup of this printer was quick and easy it soon failed. In the past I have always had HP all-in-one printers and this was my first Epson unit. I wanted to down size when my 5 year old HP monster died as my home office printing needs have waned. After installing the ink cartridges, loading the paper and downloading the software to my iMac, I printed a couple of test pages and scanned a few documents. All was fine but when two days later I went to scan another document I noticed that the printer was off. After turning on it gave me an error message that it did not recognize any of the ink cartridges and that they needed to be replaced even though they were all still full. One of the things I liked about Epson was that they didn't send the usual ""starter ink cartridges"" that always came with the HP printers, good for only a few pages. While they were not an XL size they were all at least a standard capacity. After I worked around the ink cartridge issue I tried to scan a one page document from the control panel on the printer but the touch screen kept locking up and after a few seconds the printer would just just itself off. After several reboots, including unplugging the unit, and I kept getting the same problems I called Epson. Their tech support was knowledgeable, easy to deal with and they even spoke good English. After just a few minutes they determined, as I had, that my printer was defective and would need to be replaced. I of course opted to return the unit to Amazon and as usual I received great customer service from Amazon and the defective unit was just picked up by UPS on the day after I requested a replacement. My new printer should arrive tomorrow and I will update this review to reflect my experience with the replacement unit. Hopefully all goes well.",0,0
R2MAP6NFZQLCOT,Bought this in August 2014.  Used lightly at my house.  Only changed the ink one time.  Got an error code 0x97 and the printer sounded like it had a mechanical failure.  Could not find error code 0x97 in the manual.  Called Epson - they said hardware failure - too bad.  The point of my review is to say that a printer should last more than a couple of hundred pages - which is all I have used it for.  I will try another brand!,0,0

I haven’t tried the cartridges but at this point I don’t want to waste my money on trying to troubleshoot and to be honest the converter should work. Second, the instructions aren’t very clear.

R3C913YQ68DR6N,"I was a bit hesitant purchasing this set after reading some reviews and seeing the pictures that came attached. Despite the title clearly showing ""Pablo 80"", it seemed as if some people got a full 80 set while others did not. I chose to take that gamble, and all I can say now is that I should have trusted my gut.The set I received only had 40 colors-- an entire tray was missing. My concern, even greater than the fact that I would have paid double what the set was worth, is the fact that the item was shrink wrapped and new, meaning that it was not a set that someone had stolen the second half from. What makes that particularly concerning is that it may suggest that the pencils are counterfeit in some way. This sounds silly, but there is actually some truth behind the idea of counterfeit art supplies. So given that, I wasn't willing to even try the pencils and see if I can purchase the full set elsewhere.So please be wary as I am not the only one to have met with this issue! If you get a set of 40 colored pencils as opposed to 80, return it right away! This is not the correct set and you are definitely overpaying for the item.",0,0
RZSPTZ1420IB1,"Pain to install. Not worth the extra effort for the value. You have to pull the micro chip off the original ink, transfer it to these new ones.

Also, I did not receive any kind of owner's manual or directions. I know enough about Epson printers to get things rolling and use it.

RTQ9PHLK3QZZE,"I made the mistake of listening to folks naysaying the naysayers-- 20/20 hindsight.  Simply put, I had sticker shock from the OEM cartridges, and was living in denial.  Disregard the negative feedback like I did at your own risk!  It seems like the quality of these is a complete craps shoot.  (Either that, or there is some technology afoot to prevent 3rd parties from feeding toner into this printer.)  Anyhow, after about 3 weeks of OEM-comparable printing, the first black cartridge started streaking and becoming lighter and lighter.  Issue was not rectified by fixing unit or ITB cleaning operations.  Tried second black cartridge, and it was printing everything crookedly, like it was somehow messing up the ability of the paper to feed.  (If I had to guess. the very sticky adhesive on the pull strip isn't helping anything-- toner gets everywhere when you pull that puppy off, and it has lines on it from inconsistent release.  And no, practice does NOT make perfect on these-- in my day I've replaced hundreds of toner cartridges.)  Ran down the block to Office Depot, got an OEM cartridge, and it worked like it was supposed to again.  Pretty hard to argue with that!Sadly, for us, we can't have horrible print quality, so these are basically landfill fodder (no, there is no recycling collection with these).  And I personally won't be bothering with the CMY cartridges, I've already lost enough time just getting black working again.  If you do the math on how much output I got out of the black cartridge, I think pro-rated, it's just about break-even with OEM cost.",0,0

R7GFGWX5RQF03,"I should know, I have three of them. The 1st came from a 3rd party seller on Amazon. I started it up and then got a red screen and error 0xE8, which is accompanied by a horrible very bad noise - like gears grinding themselves into bits. It won't get past that point. I didn't even get to put ink cartridges in them. The 2nd printer came from Amazon.com itself and...did the exact same thing. When I spoke with Epson technical support  they said the print heads were irrevocably damaged do to poor packing and I needed to send them back for exchange. I am happy Amazon and the third party seller accepted the returns instead, as Epson would have taken forever. I purchased a third one from Target (I had already bought large quantities of ink for this printer, and it supposedly has the lowest per page cost of any printer, and I print a lot) and finally that one worked.I had the previous model of this printer (the 3520) and loved it. I had to give it to a family member in a printer emergency (long uninteresting story...but all I'll say is ""student"") so I figured I would treat myself to the upgrade. This printer is definitely bigger, and feels hollower and chintzier. Sometimes it just moves its print head around for fun, which always makes me jump, though I'm sure I'll get used to it. The menus are slightly less intuitive than the 3520.Anyway I miss my 3520 but hopefully this one will work. If you must have this printer then I recommend buying it from a physical retailer so if it doesn't work out of the box you can take it back to them without dealing with shipping and returns. If you are buying from a third party seller check their return policy first. ""Circuit City"" was great about it (they will get a good rating from me) but it would have been a pain if they had insisted I return it to Epson instead.",0,0

Recently I have begun to work from home and in a remote part of the US and have been unable to go test chairs out in person.

Other notes I am 6'4"" and 265lbs, have had lower back problems in the past, and work approx 10-12 hours per day in the office. With this criterion my needs are definitely custom to most office chair users. There is many Big and Tall Chairs out there to review. Most of these are for the combination of big and tall not just tall. The Aeron has a size chart that puts my height and weight into the C type chair and advertises two different lumbar options. One is stationary and the other adjustable. I chose the adjustable lumbar with my order. Once I received the chair I put it together. The chair is very simple to install only taking 10-15 mins. The chair is good looking as well. I then went through the instruction guide and adjusted the settings to my liking and begun to use the chair immediately. I have to say that I am very disappointed in the chair. The height of the back is not quite what I was expecting and when I lean back the chair top is at the middle of my shoulder blades. It is not very comfortable there and I will honestly say that I did not take a good look at the specs for the back height. All the reviews I perused were all positive on the mesh seat and back. This will be my first experience with a mesh back and seat and it was not a good one. With the mesh back is its locked and upright position it allows for my mid and upper back to sink in to the point of which there is no support at all for any part of my back except for the lumbar I ordered as an option. The mesh seat has a multitude of concerns for me. 1st of all it has no traction. This means it allows for my butt and thighs to slide forward ever so slightly every few minutes depending on how much motion I have in my normal daily tasks. 2nd the mesh seat drops all my bottom weight into the middle of the seat and strains the tailbone in a way that I have not experienced before. I feel after a few hours of sitting like I was sitting on a bench or in bleacher seating. The back and front of the seat is hard plastic, so as I put my butt back as far as I can in the seat for proper ergonomic posture I can feel the back of the plastic part of the seat under my butt and under my thighs as well. This brings me to the next point of concern. This seat is not made for anyone over 6 feet. The seat is too short for my long thighs. The seat does not come under my legs enough to support my thighs which in turn makes my posture less desired. As you can probably tell from my review I am constantly having to move and adjust and occasionally stand and walk around for a few minutes every hour or so for posture relief. I am not sure about someone of a little less weight and height but this chair was not for me and now I am on the hunt for another chair hopefully at a comparable or less price. Because to be honest the price of the chair for me was very expensive, considering it having so many drawbacks.",0,0

If you have little or no experience with scanners and you do not wish to monkey around trying to figure out how it works DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.

R3G05VYKN0EAZ0,"I have / had a Samsung CLP-315 Laser Printer that has been running flawlessly for years (8+). I have always replaced the printer cartridges with official, Samsung replacement cartridges even though they are more expensive than generic / off-brand ones. When I went to order new ones this time, the retailers I typically used did not have official cartridges for sale. Disappointing, but not unsurprising giving the printer's age at this point, I guess. After some searching, I landed on these GREENSKY toner cartridges, noting a few negative reviews around my type of printer but generally positive reviews overall. I ordered them, received them in a timely fashion and installed them without incident.The problems started when I began printing. The first few prints (black and white) were fuzzy and blurry. No problem, I assume the new cartridges are just warming up. After that, prints start smearing a bit and I'm getting ghosted images from previous page prints on the following pages. Again, I'm willing to assume some break in period, even though I've not had these issues before and I'm about 25 prints in at this point. I tried printing a full page, color image hoping to ""reset"" the print heads. The print never came out and now I have error lights.Long story short (or moderately lengthy, in this case), after much work trying to find a mysteriously absent, jammed page, troubleshooting across the internet and eventually disassembling the top of the printer. Based on my research / troubleshooting / repair guides, I finally found the missing page wrapped around what I believe is the ""fuser"" assembly in the printer. The ink / page glued to itself / the fuser assembly. Attempted and failed to extract the paper and at this point would need to engage with Samsung customer service, a lengthy process that will probably cost me more than a replacement printer is worth to fix it, given that the printer is out of warranty and I was using off-brand toner cartridges.Is it possible this catastrophic failure was just prints away from happening anyway and it had nothing to do with the toner cartridges? I suppose its technically possible. Do I believe that these off-brand toner cartridges directly contributed to or created the issue that ultimately trashed my printer? Absolutely. Can I prove any of that in the ""court of law""? Nope. So I'm just here leaving a disappointed Amazon review and returning these cartridges in hopes that I can at least recoup my $49 on top of my bricked printer.  ┐( -“-)┌",0,0

R20EMZJMPGMF9T,"My first HP printer (changed from my usual Epson WF models) because of decent reviews. If I was reviewing the printer only I would give it 5 stars.

I ordered this on Jun 26, but was not able to use it regularly till October. So it's too late to return it unfortunately.The question about skewed ADF scans & HP8720(& similar models) has been asked again & again on support forums. The answer is always the same, scripted, stock response. The fact is that the ADF is a defective piece of hardware and no amount of reset/power down cycles, or firmware upgrade is going to fix it.

R2050U8C76UYUX,"Two-Week Final Update. I tried and tried and gave it every chance. It wouldn't stay connected no matter what. What sealed the return deal was I unplugged it one last time to make it connect - buttons nor off switch would do the trick - and it didn't stay connected long enough for me to get back to my chair and print. This is NOT a printer, at least not one I would ever endorse.Day 3 8/8/19: Wouldn't wake up today to print. Had to physically go to it and bring it out of sleep. This is NOT a solution for the long term. If this cannot be fixed it will go back.Day 1 8/6/19: Functions well. Dash replenishment setup didn't work. That's probably a blessing. Too much info being shared and hacked these days anyway. It's not an important function for me, though the $20 credit would have been nice. Scans look good, though I need to do more testing. I have things setup the way I like them, just waiting for some real world situations rather than test cases.Will be using this for my home business and will likely get the secondary paper tray. I have a big dog Kyocera Mita that has it all, but just need something smaller with most of the functions it has. No need for faxing anymore so this machine should give me what I need. I have a Brother DSmobile® 920DW scanner that I love but the usb is wonky and I got tired of fixing it so the autofeed scanner on this machine will be a blessing.Brother left out the install CD, from what I can tell.

R1AUV8XWNG4LVK,"As of this writing, the picture of the Scotch Removable Mounting Squares shows that they're capable of holding up to 2 pounds. It's clearly displayed in the upper right hand corner of the box on the Amazon listing. When I received them, while everything else looked the same, the print in the upper right displayed that they only hold up to 1 pound, not 2. That's quite a difference.At any rate, since the lightweight poster board photograph that I wanted to hang on my wall weighed a mere 8 ounces, I expected no problem using these mounting squares. I was wrong. Within a matter of days, the picture fell off of the wall and was damaged. In addition, when I removed the squares from the wall, they left behind some of the gooey adhesive, making them 100% useless for the purpose intended.The bottom line is that this is a lousy product.

RT915CGSJXRTY,"I regret ever purchasing this thing!  Where to start...I've had this printer for over a year now and it has been underwhelming from the start.I purchased this for my home office.PROS: The only redeeming quality of this printer is that I can feed multiple pages to scan or fax.  But that feature only goes but so far.CONS: Print quality is a joke.  Every single page I've printed has streaks, despite multiple cleanings, ink cartridge changes, etc.If you're printing docs with just black text you MIGHT be ok, but anything else, forget about it.The monthly fee for ink that seemed like a great economical option is awful.  You get charged for every page, but thanks to a bug it would print things that you cancelled out of the queue as well as the stuff you did want.  If you don't have internet you can't print.  Customer service while not the worst I've encountered, seem unable to fix the poor print quality issues I've had since I've received the thing.I know it's easy to gloss over a bad review especially when you see other good ones, but I promise you, save your dollars and your sanity, get another printer.",0,0

Instructions easy and good enough, yet quite small.Two stars because the panel attaching to the frame where you hang the TV didn't have holes in correct place. It may be individual incidence, but practically prevents from building this thing without drilling new holes. Getting those new holes into correct place may be tricky, but doable if you know your way with tools and such.I was in impression that this would allow you to hang the TV in almost any height you want, but that was not the case. It will put the TV quite high from the ground. Again, you can drill new holes to the support booms and have it your way.That glass plate cannot handle much more than 4 lbs (roughly 2 kg). My AVR device is 4 kg (around 8 lbs) and it already bends quite much, I would not put 5 kg (10 lbs) weight on it permanently.I would rate this to 3 stars if those holes in that plate would be in correct place out of the box.

Strangely, if I set the printer from normal quality to best quality printing, the problem intensified.  Since these tanks are much cheaper than HP original, if you were printing a large number of review pages it would be worth it, otherwise not worth the money as I am not sending out anything printed from this ink.

Leaving aside the fact that it runs through ink at an extraordinarily high rate despite pretty light home printing use, the main issue is that the print head nozzles get clogged up very regularly and you need to run the cleaning routine just as regularly. The process consumes ink which is costly (check out the cost of replacement cartridges before you buy one, this will require a dedicated budget!) but, 2 months after I purchased it, the black ink nozzle has become chronically clogged which requires running the nozzle cleaning routine MULTIPLE times to get it fixed.

R18K02E20B0L5K,I really can't believe the good reviews. It said it was made out of plastic and maybe it is but it's really nothing but a sticker with maybe a plastic coating.  I assumed it was some kind of a plaque at $5 each.  I ordered two of these.  Had it been a 2 pack for $5 I might have kept them but at $5 each this is a complete scam.And to make matters worse one of them arrived damaged as they were put loosely in a box with other items.  Junk!!!,0,0

R8AL7229AN48V,"I was very enthusiastic about this printer based on the outstanding reviews it has received and my generally positive experience using Epson professional printers for scientific graphics.  While this printer is indeed speedy and produces good quality photos, an apparent mechanical malfunction on roughly every third print causes it to skew the paper slightly sideways when a given print is ~75% done.  This leaves a white triangle on one side of the print and leaves the remaining 25% of the print misaligned.  This happens using the included Epson starter paper.  Additionally, I find small black ink blobs on the trailing edge of about every third photo.  I really wanted to like this printer, but I have to say that ruining more than 50% of the prints is completely unacceptable for any printer.",0,0

R2ITGIXZBBFHRJ,"I wanted to like this pen. It replaced an Inka model that I'd had for years, and which was very reliable, reasonably small, and could open into a full sized pen, comfortable to hold. But the part where it attached to the keyring eventually broke. I've seen other reviews speak to problems with the pen falling out of its holder. I never had that happen, and it's been in my pocket for a year or so. Perhaps there is manufacturing variability, and some grip tighter than others. No, the form factor is fine, it's very compact, telescopes into a reasonably useful length, seems quite sturdy, but the darn thing doesn't write consistently. I've been through all the refills it came with, and while it may write initially, it doesn't when I need it to. So it has really been pointless to carry it. I just bought a  Fisher Backpacker Space Pen, Blue (BP/BL)  to replace it. The Fisher is bigger than I'd like, but I'd rather be carrying something I can count on, and I've had Fishers in the past and know they are reliable.",0,0

Red and yellow still work, but without blue you also can't get green or gray, so  not such a good deal after all for the color cartridge. The black is still working fine.This was a combo pack including an HP15-compatible black cartridge and an HP23-compatible tri-color cartridge, sold by New York Toner with free shipping.The black cartridge was just in a generic box that said ""Remanufactured Cartridge"", and the cartridge and electrical contacts looked pretty good.The color cartridge was in a box with the ""Premium"" brand name saying ""Replacement Inkjet Cartridge."" The contacts looked kind of worn.When I installed them, the printer (HP Deskjet 810C) would not recognize the color cartridge. (I put the old nearly-empty cart back in with the new black cart, and the printer recognized the old one.) Other reviewers of remanufactured color injkect carts have reported similar problems.I cleaned the contacts of the new color cart, back and bottom, with a rag and some denatured alcohol, and after letting it dry thoroughly, replaced the cart. The printer was happy, and after running the print head alignment routine and printing a test page, so was I.For the price, this is a great solution (as long as they work) and free shipping makes it even better.",0,0

I would buy again if I needed something I have used before.However, I’m on the hunt for labels with a stronger stick so that, long-term, (more than a few weeks..because I haven’t even had these for a week yet), the label is STILL holding on..Overall, I would skip buying these and search up “strong stick label stickers” or something like that.

I don't believe it has anything to do with the stitching.  Since it is mesh, the way it is intertwined makes it easy for the horizontal threading to be pulled up with just a little bit of weight inside the bag.  What needs to be done is this.  The ends that are sewn under the zipper need to be glued (about 1/4 inch wide) so that the horizontal threading does not pull away with the slightest bit of weight.  The glue will hold the horizontal threading to the vertical threading. Then it should be sewn to the zipper.",0,0
R32FZFGIGR7DQX,"I really loved this chair on the site. It was easy enough to assemble (took me about an hour) although I had to really force the last set of screws.The biggest complaints I have, however, is that the material is pretty cheap and not very durable (I had tears in the top of it within 2 months) and after using it for the last 3 months the suspension (that allows the chair to stay in place) weakened. Thankfully, I have a standing desk that can be moved up and down, but after adjusting my desk over the course of a couple of weeks, I realized I hadn't changed the height of my desk but that my chair was just actually lower!I kept trying to bring it back up to its highest height and it will remain there...for about a good 20 mins, then it begins to gradually shift down again (es no bueno).I also agree with other reviewers' feedback that the tilt forward can be a bit awkward and am only just now correlating the timing of me getting this chair to the back pain I've started to have in the last couple of months.All in all, it's a cute chair if you're looking for something stylish that you only need to sit in every now and again. But if you need a chair (for work/home) that you have to sit in for several hours a week, I'd pass on this one.",0,0

Photos made from slides are particularly terrible. I would say results from any enlargement are unsatisfactory for any purpose.I don't blame Epsen. Their products are generally as good as their competitors, often better. I think the problem - at least for me - is that I believed the hype that high end scanners produce professional or near-professional results. This claim leads to unrealistic expectations for people who know what professional work looks like. The results are barely good enough to send copies of pictures to close family members. You certainly could not use one of these scanners in a professional endeavor, or even for serious hobby work.It makes great copies of text, but so do scanners that cost $100. My advise is to buy a scanner for $100 to $200 for text scanning and hire a lab to do your photo and slide work.",0,0

RV7AZNJ9UNV70,"I am quite baffled at the reviews for the Aeron. We've had them in our office for a few years now. Everyone was raving about how great they would be for their price. Now we have people sitting on folding metal chairs instead of their aerons because of the problems and discomfort they cause.The biggest flaw is the front edge of the chair part where your legs hang over. There is no padding. The edge is rock hard and after sitting in the chair for a couple hours, you can barely feel the back of your legs.The next design issue causes long term damage, and that seems to be the way the seat ""bowls"". I am 29 and have bad hip pain while walking after prolonged sitting in the aeron. You can feel it as soon as you stand up, as your hips shift back into a normal position. Out of 80 employees at my work, the only person who ""loves"" the aeron is the manager that was in charge of ordering them. I think people are blinded by the fact that they wasted [...] on a chair and force themselves to like it.It's a fail. I have a [...] leather office chair at home.. I can sit there for hours and relax with no joint or leg pain.Pros:- Lumbar pad (which I took off because it was annoying)- Mesh seat to avoid ""sw'ass""Cons:- Uncomfortable after more than 10 min- Bowl seat causes hip problems and can't stretch your legs- Hard edge under back of legs is like sitting on bleacher seats.- Arm rests on 70% of the chairs in the office have come loose or fallen off.",0,0

RYA1V0N2PZOSC,"I gave it a chance since it had 7 five star reviews. The black cartridge worked for 3 printings before it said I was out of ink. I opened it up and saw that it was leaking ink from the bottom onto the sensor. I tried wiping it off carefully because I direly needed to print a shipping label for my business. That's when I noticed the Canon logo crudely scratched through.  These are likely refills and poorly done. Either that or they got ahold of defective cartridges. Either way, it's not worth the gamble at 2/3 the price of the Canon cartridges.  I just wasted three days and now I have to try to return this crap. Will have to purchase the Canon cartridges before getting a refund for these.If you are the ""manufacturer"" reading this, don't waste your time trying to make me happy. I'm not deleting this review, nor do I want one of your replacements. Stop cheating people. You're worse than telemarketers because you waste much more of people's time and money.

R3B7ORCD5CB007,"So unfortunate. I recorded my message, and when I unplugged the recording cable from the device, the little piece that connects the two broke off immediately. I was extremely careful with it, I wasn't rough with it at all and it was so easily broken. I was supposed to use it as part of a birthday surprise to my boyfriend for concert tickets to go see his favorite band, and that whole idea got ruined as soon as the device broke. I could still hear the song even after the piece broke off, but it was full of static and I couldn't even hear the song I had playing in the background. And it wasn't my surroundings or the video I recorded off of because I recorded in a quite area and the video was great quality.

R2D2ZU12U19IH8,"On the positive note, I like the colors, and writing itself goes well. They seem to be erasable as expected. Really the primary issue is that I purchased these for use with a Vellee smart notebook. Per some other questions and reviews, I saw that these work with other smart notebooks. Vellee ecommended using ""Frixion"" pens, so I thought these would work. However, the only way I can really use these is if I take my picture and clean each page each time before I can change pages. If not, the ink stays wet for long periods of time. Even hours after I finished writing I flipped the page, and when I went back to the page it had smeared due to the ink still being wet. Often I write for pages and pages. I don't really want to stop in the middle of working just to take the picture of the page and clean off the work every page. So these might work well for other needs, but they don't work for my Vellee and this is why I purchased them, so I'm definitely disappointed.",0,0

R8XWOWWUJ9N0S,"Since the day my printer was purchased the color printing has not worked. I bought it NEW only a few months ago and I've tried everything. I thought it was the ink it came with originally, so I switched it out for new ink and it still does a poor job(see the attached pictures). I did A LOT of research for home-office printers and actually this one came very highly rated! I read reviews, I did the consumer reports research, I did it all! However, since the day I bought mine, it hasn't functioned properly! Now I am rating it with 1 star really for the COLOR PRINTING ONLY. I mean, who buys a color printer that can't print in color anyway and expects it to get over 1 star?I went online looking for a customer support phone number; I couldn't find one. So I sent a facebook message to Epson explaining the issue. I needed help quickly and I was hoping they could do it online since most of my experience with technical support for computer stuff has been bad and I'm stressed enough. Well, needless to say I think I've had my intelligence insulted by Epson more times than I can handle. The person basically told me a list of things I should try to AVOID with my Epson printer; I never knew a lot of these things. Apparently their printer works better if you download what you need to print, save it first to your computer then print it-- instead of printing directly off the screen or website.However, the worst was when the person on the phone with customer service (I wanted to avoid this) asked me to take out the ink cartridges and read her the numbers on it (making sure I had installed the right ink to begin with) and then CHECK THE BOTTOM FOR TAPE. I never said it wasn't printing ANY color by the way, I have been saying it prints color POORLY!! So by the end of my conversation she decided I'm eligible for a replacement under warranty. However, my printer arrived broken. They want to give me a refurbished one, which I politely explained angered me for a number of reasons. First, my printer still is brand new, and I didn't buy a used printer off Amazon. Second, it arrived this way, it isn't like it all the sudden broke, it's been broken the whole time. I really loved what Epson said though. Her technical support is CLEARLY not customer support because her reasoning behind me getting a refurbished one is laughable, ""it's not like we can resell yours, it's defective"". Well duh! However, what about the NEW ONE that I was promised when I paid money for it? That one I'm still kind of waiting for... Well my point is, BUYER BEWARE...DON'T BUY THIS PRINTER...

That cleaning by the way takes about 10 minutes and judging by how little I print uses about half the ink each time. I have gone through more print cartridges than pieces of paper.The ADF of the scanner is useless as well. If you put a piece of paper in the ADF and turn it on it pulls it half way in and gives a paper jam error. You have to turn it on, wait for it to go through the excruciatingly long boot up process, then put the paper in the ADF. Oh and you have to put them in one at a time or it thinks it's jammed.I wrote this entire review while waiting for it to finish the boot up process, and I can't type fast at all.I expected better from Epson but I know better now.After this printer I'll never buy any Epson product again.",0,0

I have to take 3 more seconds looking at the paper to determine which is the correct side, but for the price difference, it's worth it.) All in all, very comperable to the Epson. The reason for the 2 star review is that half of the ream had a crease in one small corner. The shipping box arrived in pristine condition, so I imagine it happened at manufacturing. Not sure what force caused such a small crease to run through so many sheets, but it was there. I had to toss the print coming though on that corner of the first 10 sheets, where the crease was biggest. I would have sent it back but I was out of paper and needed to print right away.",0,0

Zebra and Crayola, though, really?The outside and inside covers are slick so some of my pens/markers smudged and smeared. Hindsight - I should have done a pen text on the back first but when the creative juices start flowing sometimes you don't think of these things.Also, the pages stick together. Be careful or you'll end up with wasted blank pages where you don't want them.Overall I can't give these more than 2 stars because of these issues. I've purchased quite a few bujos over the years and thought I'd give a travelers journal a go because I'm tired of redoing the beginning pages every time I start a new journal.

R2H9J3WTNOR5PT,"I used these stamps to mail packages to customers for a very small item. This was a big mistake. Not every sheet aligns correctly. Some sheets will show the postage amount while others will not. Despite this each stamp will have a bar code on it. So, you assume a printed bar code will be encoded with information right? Wrong. Over a period of 6 months I received about 10 packages back. Reason? Someone working at the post office didn't recognize this stamp. On some they wrote, ""?"" on the stamp. On others they stamped, ""No Postage"". These packages were retrieved from our P.O. Box. Keep in mind I'd been mailing these same envelopes with the same stamps for 6 months.I contacted Endicia. At first they stated it was something I did wrong. I reexplained the postage was printed and had been used several times from 6 months. There was no user error. I explained it was the postal service rep not being familiar with their product. They told me that I needed to complete a form, include the stamp with the envelope used and wait to get a decision on if I would get a refund. To do this it would cost about $5. The rep mentioned that there was no guarantee I would get a refund for this postage. He went further to state, ""you should just let it go."". I have a hard time ""letting it go"" especially when I've spent money and a company has profited. So, here I am leaving this review. It is cheaper to order stamps online from the USPS website, buy them from your mail carrier, buy them at an authorized stamp retailer or buy them directly from the postal service building.Did I mention if you misprint there is no refund? If your printer jams there is no recourse? If a postal worker doesn't know this product then it is sent back to you. Bottomline, you lose; you lose twice. The first time you lose is by purchasing this paper to print stamps on. The second time you lose is when you need a refund and can not get it. This is s product not all workers at the USPS are familiar with based on our experience. You can get a refund of ""real"" stamps. Just go to the post office and they will give your money back.

R12XXVYWNBVKLQ,"After seeing so many positive reviews I thought this would be worth the price. Perhaps I got a ""lemon"", but the ink flow and nib made the pen unusable. I have owned dozens of pens in every price range (below 300.00, not the high priced ones) and never had such problems. The pen IS beautiful, but after trying many approaches to fixing the problems, I have relegated this to the back of the case. Nice to look at but a waste of money, and although may people have had good luck with theirs, I won't 'roll the dice' on any Kaweco in future.",0,0

R1AFL7FPOHTS1M,"I would give zero stars if I could.The first one lasted about 4 months, printed great, then a black line started appearing when I printed.  I lived with that a couple of weeks and then it started to print with blank streaks in the black ink areas.  I thought it was the ink cartridge.  I cleaned the printer heads, without success.  I bought new ink cartridges.  It was not the ink.  Amazon was great about sending a replacement.Now the replacement, after about 1 month, had a paper jam.  I cleared the paper, however, the error message remains after several attempts to go through all the places to clear and turn off turn on.  I took out the paper whole with no torn off parts to be stuck in the rollers.  Amazon is sending out another replacement.I have never had such problems with Epson in the past. Matter of fact I went back to Epson after an HP which I had over a year broke off a very tiny plastic part which kept it from printing.  I thought that was poorly designed.  If the third Epson craps out I will try Canon.Frustrated with poor quality workmanship.  At this price point, these printers are disposable items, filling our recycle bins and landfills.  Not sure how much more to spend to get better quality or if that would guarantee quality.  The ink cost is high no matter what. Buying a repair warranty?  I don't want to spend down time with repairs on something that should last a much longer and give a lot better service. Not made in USA...

R1E9SLNCKMH4WW,"I wanted a nice pen roll for my square-shaped Copic markers, round-shaped pens and pencils and this pouch seemed good based on the reviews. The construction is alright, but the elastic slots for pens are too small for my copic markers. They're even too small and close together to hold something as thick as a sharpie. I tried putting 5-6 micron pens in consecutive slots and it make the roll too thick to even roll up. Once the roll is full of pens, even alternating slots, it's too thick for the snap enclosure to snap together. The snap itself is difficult to close, too. This product could be vastly improved with bigger or more spaced out elastic slots and a belt buckle or tie style enclosure.",0,0

RJ3ZJVG72U5UY,"My main issue seems to be with the black ink, I think. Printed 2-3 pages just fine when I first installed it - HOWEVER, the product page claims it will work fine with my printer with no issues.  Boy is that not the case.  Of course HP and the printer didn't recognize it so I didn't have proper communication between devices and it wouldn't read the ink levels, etc.  Then, it stopped printing. If I would run a print head cleaning it seems to print just fine, but when I went to print a document it would skip and at the best you would see ghost writing, really faint gray-ish ink with huge blank spots. They recommended I take the cartridge out and let it set upside down for a while then re-install it.  Seems like an odd request.  Well, I decided to do that, and to my dismay, after almost NEVER using it, the cartridge appears to be completely empty. It has a clear side, and all I could see were little black moisture dots where the ink used to be. This was the worst decision ever, and after reading the reviews I thought I was doing a great thing. In my opinion these are junk and I never should have bought them.",0,0

R1UB6L2WKZ87E9,"I really wanted to like this pen, with the good reviews and affordable cost. I think it prints out absolutely beautiful and fine text, even compared to my friend's Lamy Safari model. The pen is made of nice materials (yes it's actually metal at this price point), but does have a kind of... rattle like movement when you press on the cap (while closed). Especially awful is trying to fill/use it for an extended period. When you try to fill it, it's unable to be able to fill the entire converter, which itself has a very low capacity. Along with this low ink capacity, it tends to dry out quickly, so that if you wait one measly hour in between writing, it's annoying to get the pen's ink flowing again.

R1DKA7NGWSULQ9,"This is a pretty heavy duty shopping cart.  It easily holds 5 or 6 bags of groceries.  The wheels are pretty tough.  However, a word of warning, the fumes from the plastic parts and coatings used in the manufacturing process are almost overwhelming!The covering on the handle slides around, which is a little annoying.  Also, it did take a little effort to assemble.Update:  I lowered the rating for this large cart.  After maybe a dozen uses one of the welds broke rendering it useless.  Between the smell that never went away and the broken weld I cannot recommend this item.

R1O06WPWVX67IO,"Very disappointed. Firstly, the portion that tilts up and down has to be FORCED to close. It seems that there is not enough space so the wood rubs together every time with the pleasant sound of nails on a chalk board. I literally just opened the box today and there is already wear from the rubbing between the two edges. Secondly, the holes for the wooden slat that holds the laptop in place when tilted are crooked.... which results in my laptop being sideways if I try to use it. In the video review, the slats appears to fit quite snug, but if I lift my desk it falls right out. I was pretty excited about this purchase, especially after all the great reviews, but I am very disappointed.After my initial review the company shipped me a replacement and emailed me multiple times to apologize. I am adding a star for that reason. I am attaching photos of the second product as well, as I am still not satisfied with the product quality. Please note that the packaging did not appear to be damaged and the table was inside of bubble wrap so I do not believe this occurred during shipment.

R2UT45SBFU95UM,"There are SOOOO many things wrong with this printer.  I switched from an older Canon Pixma that finally died.  The Epson is completely different, and I wished I had purchased another Canon.  First off, the printer had an error message upon set-up that we couldn't fix, so back it went to Amazon.  We were able to set up printer #2, but I'm very disappointed with it.  I can't believe all the positive reviews, unless those buyers aren't heavy users.In my opinion, this Epson is not for heavy duty users, especially for color printing.  I like to print out color contact sheets of digital photos (ex. 35 mini pics per letter size paper).  The print time is tedious, the quality is poor, and it prints last page first.  I prefer my sheets to come out of the printer in numerical order, not reverse.  That's just one little thing that bugs me.Also, the ink goes fast.  I thought I'd get at least 50 pages just out of the start-up ink, but I didn't.  I replaced all the colors relatively close together, and between the first start-up tank of magenta AND the replacement tank of magenta, it only printed 44 letter size pages in color, 4 5x7 photographs, and a handful of b/w pages TOTAL.  That means the replacement tank (not a starter tank) DIDN'T even print out 44 pages in color!!!!  This is very disappointing, and not acceptable to me.  The pictures I actually printed out on photo paper looked decent, but nothing exceptional.Another complaint:  after you replace an ink tank, it takes several minutes for the machine to calibrate it and let you finish printing.  When all three colors go out close together, you lose about 15 minutes of print time.For black and white printing, I had a hard time printing on a label sheet.  It seems like I should've been able to feed the label through the top slot, but I couldn't make it take the paper no matter what.  I think you should be able to bypass a setting.  I feel, as the user, that I should be able to feed the sheet through either feed.  But no, it wouldn't print a darn thing unless I put the label sheet in the tray.  I was worried the labels would peel off and get stuck in the printer since the paper has to wind around to feed through.I haven't even had a chance to try out the scanner yet, since I've had so many problems just printing.  I'm seriously considering buying a Canon for color printing and just keeping this one around for simple b/w printing.",0,0

RM3X1D2QP6OLE,"At the rate I print, I can usually get a year out of a cartridge, maybe more.  This one lasted about 3 months before the black cartridge left random spots all over the page.  I used the clean function from the printer's menu to clean the fixing unit and ITB in the hopes of clearing up all the messy spots.  I must have tried 2 dozen times, but the spots remained.  Finally I went to Staples, dropped one hundred thirty on a new Canon black cartridge, problem solved.  You really do get what you pay for.  As another poster mentioned, I might still try another manufacturer or even a local supplier, but the large numbers of negative reviews for this supplier plus my own personal experience will keep me from using them again.  BUYER BEWARE!Oh, as for the color cartridges:  I don't print a LOT of color pages and so far, so good.  I'm concerned that it is only a matter of time as the page count gets higher that they'll fail as well.

R32AD431SMAW78,"Had an old Dell printer that printed GREAT pictures.  Apiece of plastic that held in a printer cartridge broke.  I called Dell and they told me there was no replacement part and I would need to buy a new (Dell) printer.  I researched budget color home printers with emphasis on printing color pictures.  The Epsom workforce 3620 was rated #1.  We have an old Mac but the description indicated the printer would be compatible.  I found the best price at Amazon so I ordered the printer.  Rec'd the printer promptly, inserted the installation disk, followed wireless instructions, and the computer ""crashed"".  Took two trips (70 mi each) to get the computer fixed, the computer person spoke with Epsom and they said that our computer had the correct specifications as listed by Epsom, but since it was older than 2010, we could nt use wireless. Bought a USB adaptor. printed pictures that had light and dark lines running through them.  Ran out of ink (very quickly), ordered new ink jets from Epsom, inserted those, got very poor quality pictures-too much green and then very washed out pictures that did not compare to what was on the computer.  Printed about 15 lousy pictures and out of ink in one cartridge.  Consequently my ""budget"" printer has cost me a lot of money and a bunch of pictures that I cannot frame and hang up.

R22X9OP6T4RXBN,"Wow,  DO NOT believe any positive reviews.  I printed 45 documents with my printer and 107 scans.  It took me 117 hours to do this work.  I do not remember a case where I did not have to reset the printer. Might have happened.  I did run through a full set of  the print cartridges.  Yes in 45 print jobs.  So I have spent over $100 on print cartridges for my 45 documents.  So that's about a $1 per page--good deal.  But when you consider the 117 hours, then it is mind boggling how the gross incompetence of Epson is.  I should also say that I am a programmer.  So this is ALL EPSON's FAULT for producing atrocious products.  I should sue them.  By the way, you should know that the cartridge that they say has twice the ink of the normal cartridge is incompatible.  So I spent $27 for that and it simply does not print.  Two hours later it does not print.  The good news is that unlike other cartridges, I wasted no paper.  So,  when I punted the printer across the room,  I unjured my toe.

The pictures only make sense if you are refilling the same model number which I was not.  Let's fast forward.I got out newspaper for the table and gloves for me.  I carefully assembled all the materials. Carefully removing the label as indicated, I inserted the needle into the black inkbottle and drew a small amount into the needle.  Then I inserted it into the small hole on the cartridge.  I very slowly injected ink into the cartridge.  Better safe than sorry.  I repeated the process with the color cartridges.  I put the cartridge labels back in place.  Then I re-installed the cartridges in my printer.  The good news:  the printer recognized them as HP, but showed them as empty or nearly empty.

Within days of getting the stapler (which I only used 2 or 3 times), it was jammed and the stapler cartridge was stuck. That's when I read the reviews, which seems to be a common issue with this stapler! But, I gave it the benefit of the doubt and exchanged it for a new one. When I received the second one, the same thing happened after owning it for maybe 3 or 4 days. Again, used it about 4 or 5 times. So, I just returned this one.

R1IJH17B15CDJV,"I'd initially raved about this pen and given it 5 stars. It looks great and writes smoothly. It also feels solid. It does have a substantial weight that I appreciate. But next time I'll wait to write a review.I was at first a little unhappy to discover that the interior has a thin plastic sleeve (the old American Cross pens that I've had were all metal inside), but this wasn't a huge deal. What initially ruined this pen for me is that after 2 weeks of regular use, the replaceable ink refill started clicking, as many cheap roller ball pens will do. I realized I probably had a faulty tip and that this problem may be as simple as putting in an ink refill. My concern was that if I did this and consistently got clicking from refills, I'd have a $75 pen that I can't return that is far too annoying to write with. The tip was clicking pretty much every time it touched paper and I don't write in cursive. I couldn't handle the sound, so I stopped writing with it.I was hoping to return the pen, but the seller was being very pushy about me accepting a replacement refill cartridge instead. This was annoying, but in the end I got tired of arguing and accepted the replacement cartridge. It was working well for several months.Then, after about one year, the clip lost all of its tension and just hangs there. This is why I'd wanted my money back in the first place: the overall quality of the pen is mediocre. That was obvious when the first tip was clicking all the time. Next time I decide I want my money back, I'll argue longer. This was a $75 pen; it should have been basically maintenance free for more than a year in my world. I've had $10 pens last longer.",0,0

Second printer worked great for about a month and then started printing streaked and blurred lines like the first. Called customer support and jumped through their hoops a second time but still the printer would not print clear pages. So, I thought why not try a third printer. Third printer worked for about a month and then started doing the same blurry streaky prints as the first two. At this point, I'm giving up.

I’ve had many calculators in my life, and even ones I’ve had since high school (which has been years now) aren’t this dirty.

R2QGG6NDKXD3NR,"If I'd left a review of this product within the first few weeks of use, I would've given it 4 or 5 stars; it's lightweight, pretty, and worked like a dream, even if the side drawer tended to stick, mine never came with a baffle, and I never figured out how to lift the table like the pictures showed. However, after a month or so, the orange pieces meant to hold the screws in had fallen off -- one had snapped entirely, cracking in half like the Titanic -- and one of the screws had fallen out and was never seen again (probably hiding out under some furniture as a very inconvenient cat toy). By the time the fan itself stopped working, three screws had fallen out and none of the orange pieces were intact.Even though the legs were so damaged they wouldn't stand up on their own (and had a tendency to fall off), I still used the table because the fan was so handy. I wasn't happy with the product, but I wasn't going to throw it away while it still served its purpose. After about 4 months, even that stopped working; I tried every USB port on several computers, and the fan wouldn't turn on for any of them.Now it's a hunk of dead wood in the corner of my living room, the remnants of a very expensive good idea.

I question whether these are authentic Mont Blanc refills because they most certainly do not match the quality of the Mont Blanc name. I am so disappointed that it took me YEARS to finally be able to get a coveted Mont Blanc pen and now it just sits in a pen cup because it's totally useless thanks to the inability to purchase quality refills.

R2IER7E1ALIV4J,"First of all, this design is very unsophisticated, it's ok for the first 1/2 hour but the angles are wrong and the lack of tilt in the seat and the center of gravity where the leg and feet are is like sitting in a chair that has had an inch cut off the front legs.  No way to relax, it throws your center of gravity forward.  The 'leathersoft' is cheap vinyl and needs a vinyl treatment (auto parts store) for it.  This was pretty easy to put together.  I had to be careful to get the bolts lined up but it was straight forward.  I got the high back white on with chrome, surprising my wife, but it looks good.  I saw a white on in an office.  However, it didn't tilt, just rocked about 1/2 inch and not comfortable.  I searched through the reviews for the word 'tilt' and quickly saw you have to pull the lever 1/2"" to unlock it.  I feel bad that so many people didn't see that.  I was going to buy this last week and put it in my shopping cart but didn't check out until the next day.  Then, that seller was out of them and a note in my cart said they expected more in about 10 days.  The other sellers had much higher prices and that's all that was available at that time.  So I just checked back a couple time and in a few days the competitive price was back, no problem.  I bought it quickly and very glad to have it, it's really nice, especially for the price.  Too bad it's so uncomfortable. after 15-20 minutes.",0,0

Took it to the meeting and discovered it only took legal file size, so bought those... then discovered you can't put the darn lid on if you use file folder labels- they stick up higher than the lid!The folders hang with about 3"" of dead space below them, so it's incredibly foolish that there isn't ANY clearance about the folder labels to squish on the lid.And I went to return it to find out that the returns window has passed. So I'm stuck with this total piece of JUNK that I can't put the lid on, unless I want to take off all the file folder labels!The construction and wheels are OK, but if you think you're going to haul labeled file folders around in this thing, think again and DO NOT BUY IT!After hundreds of purchases from Amazon, this was my first-ever attempt to return a product that totally is mis-represented.

RU6DNEJ2G1A75,"I ordered this cartridge as a replacement for our new M177mf. I choose this brand after researching reviews from a number if vendors, and although this specific cartridge only had one (5-star) review, the reputation of the maker seemed quite good. But even though it was less than half the price of the HP cartridge, I decided to test this one before ordering a full set of color ones.The cartridge fit fine, and the printer seemed happy with it. (There was a dialog asking to validate it as a genuine HP cartridge, but obviously that wouldn't make sense.) For the first few prints, it seemed OK. But after 10 page or so, a series of smudges appeared down the left side of every page. I tried removing, gently shaking, and replacing the cartridge a number of times, to no avail. I tried the cleaning page (although the printer cleaning process never touched the black, cyan, or magenta cartridges, which I verified with HP, who still hasn't gotten back to me about why the cleaning process doesn't match the manual and online instructions), and closely examining the cartridge for problems.In the end, I was forced to order a new HP cartridge. Using that eliminated the smudges.I don't like paying exorbitant prices for the HP cartridges, but if this is an example of the quality of the compatible cartridges, then there really isn't a choice. And even at half the price of the HP toner, they're still too expensive to experiment with different brands.",0,0
R1Q2XLNNOLBXIZ,"I bought 4 of these packs to distribute around my hospital during Breast Cancer Awareness Month (BCA month = October), even noting the review about the ink coming off in hot weather.  Well, there are no ""hot weather"" days in Missouri's October, and the hospital has AC; nevertheless, within 2-4 days of placing them at different departments around the hospital all the pens were completely white. No more printing left on them at all. The only way to tell they were the same pens was the pink end-tip formed out of solid colored plastic. If they had only lasted for a few weeks or months of wear I could somewhat rationalize it based on the cheap price. As it is, the reason for buying these pens (the BCA printing) didn't even last til the end of BCA month!

R3UBPA47BVCFFX,"I can't believe this has a 4 out of 5 rating. Frost King tape is terrible. I've been insulating my windows and patio door for years and every time I give Frost King tape a chance, I regret it. The tape will keep coming undone while you're trying to put it up. It will bunch up and roll up under the plastic while you're laying out the plastic, making itself useless and forcing you to redo that side. Any little bit of moisture built up between the window and the plastic will cause the tape to come undone. If you have a window that you never open and want to insulate for year round insulation, there's no way this tape would be good enough. You would have to redo the window every season, multiple times a season if it's a bathroom window due to the moisture. I've even tried doubling up on it and laying out two strips of tape on each side of a window. It seemed to work better but it still has difficultly lasting through a whole winter. I'm just not impressed with it. It's bad tape and a waste of money.If you want a less frustrating and more durable tape then I recommend DUCK double sided window tape. I never regret using it and if you have any experience at all with window and door insulation, then you'll also notice the difference. My only complaint about DUCK window tape is there's not much to a roll. 1 roll seems to be enough to do 1 and a half windows, and you'll easily go through at least 2 rolls if you're insulating just a few windows.

After printing less than 10 pages in the first month of ownership, the printer stopped printing.  This Epson printer initially worked great.  Now it goes through the motions, but pages come out completely blank showing error code Ox9D.  After wasting valuable time with customer service and exhausting the squence of steps directed by the printer, I searched online for a remedy and followed all available instructions, but this printer is useless.  I replaced the small temporary ink cartridges as directed and discarded them - a popular recommended remedy is to re-insert the temporary ink supply cartridges and power it up.  Based on Amazon reviews, I believed I was buying an ideal printer that I could rely on for years to come so I purchased $60+ supply of ink to be well equipped for future needs.  After only 6 months, I realize this printer is only suitable as filler for a garbage dumpster.  I have an Epson label maker than works great, but proceed with extreme caution before buying an Epson printer.

I bought it based on the good Wirecuttter review, but I'm pretty sure they didn't use the printer for long or on a regular basis.Here is a list of my issues:* Broke after 1 yr 1 month. Just won't power on period. And after I just bought $70 in ink.* Seems to use a ton of ink. I was constantly needing to replace the ink cartridges on this printer, and they are not cheap!* Does not have a good ""low power"" mode. When it goes to sleep it doesn't wake up from a wireless print job.* Does not print black when color cartridges are out of ink.* Design is just bad. Everything from how it opens to replace the print cartridges to where the ethernet cable connects - in a visible location on the side, to the esthetics of the thing - Ugly. I know it seems trivial, but I much preferred the UX of my HP ink jet I had before this one.I will say that the print quality and scan quality is pretty good.

R1X3TJ5PQHHA60,"I had read the bad reviews of this thing on Amazon, but I needed a cart this size in the worst way. When I saw it at my local Ace Hardware today, I thought about it for about 30 seconds...then figured I'd take a chance on it. After all, it couldn't be as bad as the reviews on Amazon made it out to be, could it? Turns out it wasn't. It was a hundred times worse! OMG. Who in their right mind could even design a product this bad? And even if that was allowed to happen, what genius at the manufacturer decided it would be a good idea to sell this thing? Did anyone associated with the company even try to put it together or use it??? I doubt it, because if they had this cart would never have come to market. Never. Ever. It's virtually impossible to assemble. The package touts ""no tool assembly."" Little did I know that that meant there was literally nothing holding this thing together. No screws, no clips, not even holes for ends to stick or snap into. It's all pretty much based on gravity. I felt like a circus juggler while assembling this cart. I was holding lightweight pieces of painted steel, but they may as well have been chainsaws. That's how hard it was to get this thing together. And after it was together, and the casters were popped on? This is the painted steel version of a house of cards. Yes, it's that flimsy. Shame on you, Whitmor for even making a product like this. What were you thinking?? If someone offered to PAY me $100.00 to use this, I would emphatically say ""NO!"" Needless to say, I returned this travesty to the hardware store. Do yourself a favor and DO NOT order this. If you do, I guarantee you will regret it with every bone in your body. If I could have rated this zero stars, I would have.",1,1

It took me 10 minutes of disappointment after disappointment trying to cut different types of paper, etc to ultimately decide I needed to return it.The plastic is a sub-par grade, very flimsy.The blade does not cut through paper very smoothly, not one sheet, much less 3 as it claims often not at all. It tore newspaper with the blade, rather than cut it, it caught it and tore it.

R2Y2WEAOVT0Q87,I used this in my classroom.  It worked great for about two months then wouldn't sharpen pencils any more.  Asked for a replacement under the warranty and was sent one out in about two weeks.  This one arrived broken right out of the box.  The mechanism inside it just clunked around loose in the casing.  It didn't function at all.

I wonder how many people who gave this five stars after a week never updated their review when it broke.,0,0
R3AEOT5XF9FU1U,My wife bought these to make our annual Christmas cards and they’re awful for that. Neither dye based nor pigment ink ever dries on their glossy finish and adhesive paper peels right back off.

I have a very wide knowledge in software troubleshooting as I am tech savvy, so I did some digging and finally found an app that works with my all of my android devices, so that was a problem solved. Now mind you, if you're not as tech savvy as I am, an average person wouldn't be able to figure it out as the Epson website does not have a solution to the problem. I have printed about 50-60 pages since 5 days ago, Today 12/05/16 I turn the printer on and it runs through it's head cleaning, then stops, shuts off, just to turn back on and do it over and over and over and over, you get the point. Ink was full, now completely gone! I cannot connect to the printer neither through wireless or usb connection at all, to manually reset it or fix. Epson has no solution and neither does internet for the problem I'm experiencing, and it won't even give me any error, NONE! Per Epson's user guide, I've disconnected printer from the outlet and pull the plug out of the printer, did a reset by holding down power and stop button for 7 seconds or more, waited 15 seconds then plug everything back to no avail! I'm attaching a video I took of the problem I'm experiencing with this printer, so you can see what I'm talking about. BTW, I had to stop the recording because it took over 4 minutes and it still wouldn't stop, very very frustrating!Thank goodness I'm still within a 14 day period so I can get a full refund, oh and I bought a 2yr warranty because the sales guy kept on with it, I now see why! I will never buy another Epson product again! I still own NX110 that I only used for scanning and fax because my HP was for printing photo and color pages.

I was so excited to find a simple, low cost replacement toner cartridge for my HP printer.  The product description said I had to replace the chip from the HP cartridge to the new cartridge.  How hard could that be, I thought?  After all, I am a pretty handy guy. The package arrived with the tools necessary for the chip replacement.  Nice.  A piece of paper referred me to the chip replacement instructions.  Searching, I discovered that they were NOT enclosed.  Back to Amazon I went, and watched the nice video  (Watch it first if you think this is easy to do - my bad for not watching in advance!)  I opened the printer and saw the chips.  They are SMALL.  REALLY SMALL!  See the attached picture.  I tried to remove the chip per the video.  No luck.  I tried calling customer service.  No one answered.  I fiddled around some more and the chipset came loose!  I was on my way.  When I went to put it into the new cartridge, I discovered that I had to apply about 50 pounds of force to mount it properly, WITHOUT damaging the chip.  After 5-10 minutes, I succeeded.  I went to replace the cartridge, basking in my success, and, IT DID NOT FIT properly in the printer (yes, it was the right cartridge!) I tried calling customer service again.  Once again, no answer.

R2J38WKEV3Y79R,"This is my out of the box, initial review.Pros:-Nice build quality. Metal body, internal mechanisms like the spring are enclosed inside, so they will not fall out if you have to tamper with the ink cartridge.-Writes well on different materials, including wet paper. This is good because I work outside when it rains, and I needed something that wouldn't smear everywhere on damp paper.Cons:-Poor ink delivery. Feels like you really have to push down on it to get it to write good, which is easier said than done when you're holding flimsy paper in your hand. Does not write very well unless basically perpendicular from the writing surface.-Loose action for deploying pen. Not as tactile or ""clicky"" as I would have hoped, feels like it could easily be activated while clipped to me shirt/pants. Also feels very awkward to hold in the hand and click with the thumb. You have to press it down about half an inch.-A lot thinner than I would like. If the pen is even slightly wet, you could easily loose grip. Not very meaty nor much weight. I also own the pocket-sized space pen, which is roughly the same width because it's supposed to fit in the pocket nicely, but the full-sized pen should be wider.-Clip is unnecessarily thin and hard to get a grasp on. Sharp edges pinch you while trying to lift it up.-Design (or lack thereof) is boring. Would be neat for the option of getting a Space-X type logo on the side. Black matte is easy to lose track of.I will update my review after a month or so of daily job grind. Initially, I'm not very impressed. It's not as much of a ""tool"" as I initially bought it for, more of a brand and concept that wasn't very well flushed out. It's a NASA pen. That's cool, right? I would have hoped so, anyway.

I have tried ballpoint pens of various brands, gel ink, rollerball, pencil, marker, sharpie pens / fineliner pens, you name it.It sticks well, and it's great that it's recycled materials, but it is a terrible writing surface and I would rather spend a few extra dollars to get post-it brand recycled sticky notes than buy this product again.",0,0
R31KUULX9QR9ZW,"I bought this three-in-one printer because it was highly recommended and my Canon printer was not compatible with Yosemite. I can only advise everyone that this is a horrible printer, the tech support is dreadful and ignorant, it is noisy, and slow. I junked it and bought the Canon Pixma MX922 and now am (relatively) happy. I wouldn't even give it one star but it's mandatory. It is even unclear what size ink cartridge one should buy. I ordered a large size of the correct number and it didn't fit. You even have to look up online at the manual to learn how to insert the ink cartridges.

R2M0KTM7PTVS8B,"Updated April 22, 2016I saw a review of a related item with the samt idiotic wheel assembly.  There was mention of 2 cotter pins shipped with the equipment.  With my cart, I received ONE cotter pin and 4 bending bolts for the front and back wheels.  And, on my older Trimmer cart, I DID receive 2 cotter pins.  I tried those, and they DID NOT WORK.  The ends of the cotter pins are too small to be reliable held in place.  I would STRONGLY suggest the manufacturer come up with a RELIABLE way to keep the back wheels in place, because I love these carts, and I don't want to have to provide engineering instructions in my refiews (I have bought a replacement for this cart from Overstock, because I want replacements for the PARTS THAT WENT FLYING AROUND THE NEIGHBORHOOD.  Then, I am going to fashion RELIABLE back-wheel retainers out of jumbo paper clips.  Probably a D-shaped arrangement.  I am confident that THOSE won't come off and leave me with a bunch of springs all over the block.  Why can't these people use a Jesus clip or something?Update April 16, 2016.  I have to do this.I have had to reduce my review to ONE START in the hope that the MANUFACTURER WILL READ IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!WHEEL FASTENERSWHEEL FASTENERSWHEEL FASTENERSWHEEL FASTENERSWHEEL FASTENERS\Do I have to say it again? FIX THE WHEEL FASTENER DESIGN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!A back wheel of my just-purchased EXTRA-LARGE shopping cart fell off, and of course, parts went flying all over the neighborhood.  Get it?  Got it?At least they had the sense to cap the bending bolts on the FRONT WHEELS, and on my own normal-sized one, I duplicated that by shoving balls of electrical tape into the tubes by the front wheels.I'm debating whether to pick up a new extra-large for the spare parts or go to the hardware store to buy some sprigs, washers, and heavy steel wire and keep the old one.  By rights, they should send me a replacement WITHOUT requiring me to ship this heavy thing back.  Unless somebody WRITES ME FROM THE COMPANY and offers me some kind of solace, I will NOT restore the 5-star review.tHE least they could do IS HAVE A PLACE WHERE i CAN order replacement parts!Putting a ""bending bolt"" at the most vulnerable place on a wheel/axle assembly always struck me as the dumbest idea I've ever seen.  I've done my best to compensate for this stupid mistake; I would appreciate it if the manufacturer would meet me half-way.  They need MORE STABLE AND CERTAIN fasteners on the BACK WHEELS.Update March 8, 2016My wife has passed away, and I am now involved with a lady who lives about 3/4 mile from my house.  The ""large"" shopping cart is rated at I believe 50 pounds, so i bought the extra-large, which is rated at 96 pounds.  I assembled it today, and it still has those weird ""bending bolts"" for the back wheels.  I bent the ends on the back wheels as described below, but i really wish the manufacturer of this product would come up with a better way to hold those back wheels in place!  It's going to be interesting to see how this thing holds together when I take 50 lb. of cat litter over there.  I'll keep you posted.I cannot drive, and so I have had many a shopping cart.  In the old days, I used a really common two-wheeler that squealed like a banshee - these were all over the place!  I got a 4-wheeler from my mother-in-law, who got it from a garage sale, and last week, the last bottom rod fell off; the other rods were Jerry-rigged with wire, and I didn't feel like taking the trouble to fix it again.  I will keep that one for a spare.Assembly: It took a long time to assemble this, because I managed to rip the instructions in half while unpacking it.  But once I figured things out, the assembly went perfectly.  I did decide to do a couple things other people may not have done: When I put the large wheels on, I put the bending bolt through both the wheel and the cap.  Then, I squeezed the open end of the bending bolt together with pliers.  Finally, I bent the straight end of the bending bolt up against the groove in the cap.  Now, I know it's never going to come apart.Usage: In the store, the handle is about the same height as a grocery cart, so it's easy to walk it around.  I got the cart liner, and so I never use bags unless I know there will be leakage from something (such as raw meat.)I drag my shopping carts around a lot, sometimes for miles.  When dragging this one behind on the large wheels, I find it balances much more nicely than the others I have had.  It's also almost silent, and has a very smooth feel when dragging!  If the sidewalk is smooth, it's very comfortable to walk this cart on 4 wheels, although I never recommend this for any cart over long distances.I might have taken a star off for assembly issues, but they really didn't bother me.  All in all, I'm very happy with this product.",0,0

R160XSWXV0PS55,"UPDATE 1 Year Review: The positives I gave this chair some credit for on my initial reviews was looks and cushion. Well, after using this chair 3-5 days a week while working from home for a year, I can honestly say the initial cushion quality has gone out the window. The cushion has not held up....to the point where I’m shopping for a new chair already and I plan on spending a lot more money to get a sturdy, higher quality chair. This chai wobbles and moves in places it shouldn’t now, I feel the cheap sub material through the cushion now, and so honestly regret this purchase. It looks decent and is okay if you’re a lighter/smaller person it might be good for the only, but otherwise run away.I originally posted this review with a 4 star rating, but after working from home for a week on it, I am updating my review to sow a 3 star rating based on how uncomfortable I feel sitting in it for a long period of time. It has its upside but ultimately it is a small/tight fitting chair that is now with the money for taller people wanting it for regular use.Cons:I saw some reviews talking about how narrow the arm rests/seat area is. I figured these were picky or oversized people. Turns out they were right. Compared to my prior chair from Office Max, this chair is WAY more narrow. I’m 6’3” and “normal” sized/athletic shaped and slender....my hips are right at the arm rests (not touching but very close). Compared to my old chair, the arm rests also extend towards the front of the seat more....coupled with the narrow seat opening, the arm rests length makes it harder to get out of the chair at an angled direction. I have to swivel my chair completely sideways and stand up straight instead of partially turning and sliding in or out sideways. Also, the seat is not only narrow sideways but is is “short” longways.... sitting all the way back, the seat goes about halfway toward my knees.... my old chair went almost to my knee area (difference that is noticeable in comfort/weight distribution ). It seats almost like a driver side seat in a car given how most of your weight is on just your butt and instead of spread down your hamstrings, too. The chair just seems disproportionate and smaller than it should be. Smaller people might be good though. Last complaint is I ordered a black chair and they mailed me a white one. Easily fixed but still annoying and shouldn’t happen.Pros:Whatever shortcomings it has in comfort because of design/size, it at least got it right in the padding. This chair is one of the more comfortable home office chairs I’ve sat in under $200 when it comes to the seat cushion. The padding seems to be thick and solid without being too supportive or too soft. Aside from that, the overall look is very sharp. The chrome is nicely done and spruces the chair’s appearance up. They did a good job on the overall look. Also, the chair went together quite easily. Packaging was good, too.Conclusion:While there is enough of a cramped seat feeling to make it worth 2 stars deduction, and if it was too much smaller I would have returned it, the chair is nice enough looking and cushioned enough to make the $105 chair worth keeping now that I have it...and at the end of the day it is just big enough to work. I work from home and have already spent several hours sitting and it seems to be a a decision I’ll be able to live with, but I wouldn’t order it again if I could do it all over.",0,0

Epson couldn't figure out how to write decent install software?  Next, let's talk about the fact that there are all kinds of 'monitors' in the software that are little more than intrusive malware.  They suck down resources while monitoring everything you do with the printer so that they can spam you with BUY OUR OVER PRICED INK NOW! messages.

RLTKRHUHNWCT4,"Update, 11/2016: The ""finish"" on the leather has nearly completely come off the seat and parts of the back, so it looks TERRIBLE. I think this started a long time ago, but because I'm often oblivious to gradual change, it somehow just recently computed in my brain. The chair needs to be replaced, and probably should have been replaced a couple of years ago. Not recommended.-----Original review below-----I'm 5'3"" and of a pretty small build. This chair is either a little too big or a little too small for me, depending on whether or not you think I should be able to sit cross-legged in an office chair. The seat is also a little too deep for me to sit perfectly comfortably, BUT, both of these things are true in nearly every other chair I've ever sat in (including my ""other"" office chair, which is a Herman Miller Aeron chair).This is basically as comfortable as the Aeron for me, but it is less adjustable, so your mileage may vary. I have to say, I suspect that this would not be big enough for a significantly wider person, but I don't know for sure. I'm astonished that so many other reviewers seem to find this so uncomfortable due to the firmness -- I think it's perfect in that regard.Assembly was not the easiest thing I've ever done, but I did it on my own (see the first sentence for more on this!) without any major problems. Overall, the chair is a nice balance of firm and soft, it rolls smoothly but not willy-nilly, leans back but doesn't make me feel like I'm going to fall, and it's easy to adjust. I think it's also more attractive than a mesh chair, and I like that it looks professional, but not imposing.Office chairs are pricey, but this one seems competitive. I think whether or not it's right for you will depend on how important it is to you to be able to adjust every little thing, and whether you prefer a firm or soft seat. There are no flaws to this chair that would make it a bad buy, it just comes down to personal preferences.",0,0

RMII5MZGG0U6E,"I bought this product back in October (on the 18th) despite having had previously disappointing experiences with HP. I thought perhaps their product quality had improved given some of the other reviews on the products. Was I truly disappointed. The first one I received worked for about month before it decided to start jamming up. It would jam up on ever print attempt and it appeared to be due to a physical misalignment of the print head, which was catching the paper. Of course, as is Murphy's law, this occurred on the one week of the month that I do the largest 'print work' from my home office, needing to print out dozens of reports for review.I contacted customer support and after explaining to them (in painful detail) what had a happened and what troubleshooting efforts we had taken to rectify the problem they proceeded to advise me to... go through all those troubleshooting steps again. I understanding 'due diligence' but I also understand that when a customer has expressed (in detail) that they have already went through all the standard troubleshooting steps you probably shouldn't make them go through it again; it's a very telling sign that they actually already know the steps.After about an hour of troubleshooting and back and forth, the customer service agent actually advised that they would send out a new printer but wanted to charge me shipping. Needless to say I had to put up an argument about that to get it waived because, well, the defect was theirs not mine. Then they proceeded to inform me that they had to take my credit card information so that they could charge me 200.00+ if I did not return the broken printer. I mean, I guess I understand that but who keeps a broken printer?Now I'm on my second one and it ran well for about a month (roughly). Now it's constantly loosing it's connection and requiring me to restart the printer to connect to my computer, for printing. I can't even get it to communicate with my computer for scanning despite the fact I've had no issues doing so on the last two samsung printers I've had. I'm at the point where I going to have to call in to customer support again (probably for another hour) to resolve the communication issue because their software can't resolve it.Honestly, find a better printer and skip this one.

R2MPLJERCIXUNT,"I conducted a Great Pen Review a few months ago, in which I purchased a 12-pack of the following 0.5mm pens and distributed them to friends and family for evaluation: Pilot Precise V5 Stick Rolling Ball Pen, Micro Point, 0.5 mm, Black Barrel/Ink (35334), 12-Count  Pentel EnerGel Liquid Gel Pen, Fine Needle Tip, Blue Barrel, Black Ink, Box of 12 (BLN15-A)  Pilot G2 Retractable Gel Ink Roller Ball Pen, Extra Fine Point, Clear Barrel, Black Ink, 12-Count (31002)  uni-ball 207 Retractable Micro Point Gel Pens, 12 Black Ink Pens(61255)  Sharpie Pen Fine Point Pen, 12 Black Pens (1742663) The overall favorites were definitely the V5 and the EnerGel.  The EnerGel was generally preferred by those who liked a higher ink flowrate, while the V5 was preferred by those who liked a lower flowrate.  First impressions of the Uniball 207 were quite good, but occasionally these pens drew the ire of my reviewers when they stopped writing seemingly randomly with large volumes of ink still remaining.  The Sharpie pen, while better than expected, feels like a marker (because it is) and doesn't have wide appeal.The Pilot G2 was scratchy and terrible all-around; this appears to be a problem with the 0.5mm tip size, as I have heard great things about the G2 0.7mm. Sometimes the ink delivery would slow to a crawl, and other times it would stop completely; sometimes it would then return to normal later, other times it stayed broken.  Dropping or exposing the pen to the 'real world' in any way increases the probability that it is bound for an early grave.There are some truly fantastic pens out there - see especially the Precise V5 and the EnerGel - so there is no need to spend money on one with this many issues.  If you really love the G2 design, perhaps try out the 0.7mm instead - the tip isn't as fine as I require, but at least it doesn't have the ink delivery problems that this pen does.",0,0
R3PCQ3KQQ1H1Z8,"I bought this printer because of its rear loader. I print shipping labels often, and loves the idea of being able to keep regular paper in the tray, while putting shipping labels in the rear loader for later use. First of all, the machine does not allow more than one sheet in the rear loader at a time, which is just STUPID. Secondly, every time I try to place a piece of paper in the rear loader, it tries loading the paper, makes all sort of adjustments to the paper, then inevitably gives me an error message, saying ""printing is cancelled because paper was inclined while loading."" Which means NOTHING. I remove the paper, wait the 30 seconds for it to reset, then try again, sometimes, trying more than 8 times before it finally decides to work, and accepts the paper. Meanwhile, I did nothing differently. All other aspects of this machine work fine,. but considering this is why I bought it, I'm rating it low. It causes me daily frustrations. I may smash it soon, ala Office Space.",0,0

After the first one, which was enough of a waste of my money, I was stupid enough to let a salesperson convince me that the newer models were better. they are not. I've had this printer for 6 months and I printed a few pages in it a total of maybe 5 times. For that small use, I had to change ink in it so many times that it just became immensely frustrating. At 6 months, it simply stopped printing altogether, no matter how many ink cartridges I changed, and it kept asking for new ink...blank paper is what I got. THIS IS A COLLASAL WASTE OF MONEY. NEVER AGAIN.",1,1
R1DVVKOSCMGSKR,"I was so excited to find these neat, clear drawers. I had previously made purchases from this company and was quite pleased.These drawers were going to be perfect forMy organization project...you know, perfect look, perfect fit, all that! I needed a tots of 9 but decided to get one and make sure it really would work like I needed it to.Unfortunately I was extremely disappointed when my drawers arrived. On the “cabinet” side of each drawer there is a circular mark/ blemish that is VERY visible and really takes away from the attractiveness of the drawer set.  I thought maybe it was a defect, so I took photos and emailed mDesign. I was told that these circles are on everyone one of these types of drawers. They said there was nothing they could do about it, it is how it is made.I had to wonder, why wouldn’t they show this one of the many photos that are listed here, to sell the product? It seems like they have made every effort to hide the fact that the blemishes are “normal.”It seems like false advertising in a way.I kept the drawer set and will use it in another way, where it doesn’t matter if there are three blotches on the side. I will lay itOn it’s long side, so the defects don’t show.I still have this product a couple of stars, at least the manufacture replied to my email and it really is a neat set of drawers. If you don’t mind the design flaw.I have added pictures, so you may honestly decide for yourself.",0,0

RPHMDV5KJFW5R,"I didn't find the chair comfortable or very functional.  The seat cushion was surprisingly firm - too much so for my taste - and sitting on it for an extended period of time even with breaks wasn't very comfortable.  I'm around 160 lbs for reference.  The lumbar adjustment is very limited and somewhat flimsy.  I think just the bottom portion is intended to provide the most support while the top just floats there not doing much.  It only adjusts a couple of inches up and down and fell just shy of where I wanted it.  The armrest material is a little hard and didn't extend up as far as I expected.  If you are fairly tall I imagine you might want these a bit higher (I'm 5 ""9 and had them maxed out in height).  The head rest is not adjustable other than being removable (this is no surprise as it's not an advertised feature) but unless you have the perfect upper body height or only want to use it when leaning far back it's basically useless.  I also found that the chair sat a bit high for my liking.  I had it completely bottomed out and would have liked the ability to lower it by another inch or two so I could not only sit lower but have that little bit of give you get from the pneumatic cylinder when sitting down.  Generally your thighs should be parallel to the ground when seated and I couldn't accomplish this.  The mesh back was something I'm not at all used to so while it wasn't all that comfortable for me I can't say there was anything really wrong with it - I'm just used to cushioned backs.Assembly was another problem.  The chair isn't overly complicated as there are only a few parts, however there are a series of bolts and washers of varying sizes. The instructions are barely suitable to be called instructions.  They consist a parts list which in my case didn't list all of the parts that came in the box.  Above that are a small handful of few pictures on how to assemble it where you need to match up part numbers to the part pictures below then find that piece - but zero instruction outside of that.  You can do this by yourself which I did but it would be much much easier with some help.  The way the pictures demonstrate assembly don't seem consider gravity.  Since you are most likely stuck on Earth you're better off with a helper or assembling it in a different order (i.e. ground up maybe).  My kit came with a bunch of lock washers which weren't indicated in the assembly instructions anywhere but I assumed needed to be used.  The real deal breaker with assembling this chair was that I only received two of the four bolts needed to secure the seat to the base assembly properly.  I was able to work around this but shouldn't be expected to do so.  In the end I properly assembled the chair in 20-30 minutes but was left wondering why the assembly instructions were so lacking.  Maybe they are pushing people to pony up the extra money for 'professional assembly'.Overall I wasn't that impressed with the chair and will be returning it.  I took a gamble and it didn't pay off.  I was looking for an ergonomic chair and thought I could shortcut a few hundred dollars - these chairs can be supremely expensive.  Next time I'll make sure there are reviews that span a few months if possible so I can at least gauge how the chair holds up and get a better overall feel for it.  At the time of my purchase there were only 15 reviews that spanned less than a month and all but a couple of those reviews seemed suspiciously positive.",0,0

R1WHRUYDESNKNB,"Update:  Returning this pad.  Another day and I can't stand the smell any longer.  My recommendation -- DO NOT BUY!Original review:  The JETech Mouse Mat with Gel Wrist Pad will eventually do what I want it to do -- keep my wrist from getting sore during a long day at the computer.  I have a Belkin wrist rest just below the keyboard for the same reason.  Comparing the two is interesting.  The JETech wrist support is firmer than the Belkin.  I haven't determined if its good or bad yet, just different.  The Mat with Pad helped helped my wrist already, after a few days of using it.  Assuming it lasts it will overall be a good buy, as its a lower cost than the alternatives.The one negative -- it stinks!  It has a strong chemical or mold smell to it.  Kind of the same as the smell a mop that's been sitting in a janitor's push bucket for days smells like, though a bit more chemical.  I'm hoping it goes away, but its been 3 days and the smell hasn't yet decreased.  For what was $3 more, the next time I would choose the Belkin, as the Belkin keyboard wrist rest came odor-free.",0,0

R37Z1URFFDBNHF,"This wasn’t my first self inking personalized address stamp. The last one I had lasted about 7 or 8 years. It was an “ideal 80” stamp I ordered online. After it broke I decided to try amazon for our new stamp, because amazon has everything!I really like the font for the name. I was very pleased with how that turned out. The font for the address, however, was a disappointment. The font is very tiny and very bland. It’s such a lame font that I think it looks weird up against the other font. I’m sorry for the silly photo with nearly everything blacked out, but I’m not too excited about throwing my personal info out there. Hopefully it’s enough to give you an idea of the size of the font and how bland it is.My main issue is getting it to stamp legibly on an envelope. It’s definitely more finicky than my old stamp. On flat paper it works well. On an envelope with uneven areas (created by the folded contents) it ends up illegible. Probably 6 times out of 10 this happens. Whereas my old one that probably happened 1 time out of 10. And this is the reason for the low rating and the reason I’m ordering a new stamp as soon as I’m done with this review.I thought maybe, with time, I’d figure out a technique for more consistent results, but I ordered this in March and now it’s November.

R3AALKBTIQEFXU,"I've had Phone Power since 3/2011 so my ""free"" year is about up.  I'll try to review this best I can to address the various aspects of Phone Power service vs. cost.  This was my first experience using VOIP.I bought this locally and had it setup quickly.  The adapter connects to your router and you can plug in two phone lines.  There is also a USB adapter to use with a computer/laptop but I have never used it.Setup & use: setup was fairly easy.  I believe I had to go online and log in (create an account) to activate the 'clone' line.  The clone line is a nice feature that allows you to take a second call or place a call while the other line is in use.  For instance, if someone calls and your child/spouse is on the line but you need to make a call then you can use the clone line to do so.  You can also receive a second call.  Both lines use the same phone number so you still have only one number.  There was a time (maybe happened twice over almost 2 years) when I've had to contact Phone Power to get the clone line to function.  I also have it setup to email me when I receive voice message which is a nice way to get a WAV file of the message so you can get your voice mail through email while away.  I also like the option to access my account online and be able to block unwanted calls.Customer Support: As mentioned previously, I've only had to contact PP perhaps twice (I can only remember once but I do believe I may have done it twice).  The wait was not long and the Rep logs into the adapter over the internet or will have you perform the log in and instruct you on what to do.  The rep took down an alternate number to reach me just in case since if you need to power cycle the adapter you will of course drop the call.  Always have been able to resolve the issue and get things working within a reasonable time.Call quality: I've not really had any issues using the phones.  I had DSL (6 Mbps) and now VDSL (Uverse - same speed).  When I switched from DSL to Uverse, I simply unplugged the PP adapter from my router to the AT&T router and it worked without any additional setup needed.Billing/Fees: As my title suggest, visit their website to determine your costs.  Like everyone else they advertise what they charge for their plans but there are taxes & fees.  Their website will allow you to enter a zip code to see what those taxes & fees will be.  The first year I paid in full (prepaid) and got the second year free.  First year FSLS Tax rate was 7.3%.  They charge by year on the prepaid so you pay for 12 months of Regulatory and 911 Recovery cost/fees.  The next year (free year) you will be billed for that years taxes & fees and in 3/2012 the FSLS Tax was over 11% - so all said in done the total cost is around $310 and comes to about $12.92 per month.International calling:  Our plan has 60 minutes of international minutes but be aware that it only applies to certain countries & type of numbers.  My wife is Filipino so she calls the Philippines a bit and sometimes friend/relatives in UK and Australia.  Land lines are not too bad and may be included but mobile calls will cost.  It is still cheaper than she was paying previously (close to being the same though).  You will be billed monthly for any of these ""additional"" charges but we tend to be under $10 normally and not over $16 on heavier use months.  Again, visit the website and click the International Calls tab and you will be able to do a search by phone number or by country to see what they charge and if it will be included in the 60 free minutes/month.My two years are about up, so I'll review their cost structure and see if it makes sense sticking with them.  I have no problem renewing with PP (Phone Power) as I have not had any major issues with them.Update:  I recently switched to AT&T U-Verse internet and it  does not play nicely with Phone Power.  A Phone Power rep helped get things working again by opening up the firewall for the adapter but every so often I do have to power cycle the PP adapter to get the phones working again.  This only started happening once U-verse was installed instead of the old AT&T DSL line.Update again: After trying to get me back as a customer and not succeeding they sent me a bill 3 months after I canceled!  It was actually a ""collection letter"" stating I owed and if not paid they would charge my account another $25 for collection costs.  I email and asked for more information from them and they provided an invoice for Jan 30 through Mar 8 showing international calls.  I checked my credit card and they had charged twice in February so I doubt the amount they are saying I owe is correct.  They recently sent a second letter with an additional $25 charged - I will not pay anything since they closed my account online and I cannot verify what they are charging.",0,0

R88R6EHZBTRE9,"I did my share of research online, and read reviews on a quite a few websites.  In retrospect, I think I should have paid closer attention to the other negative reviews. Of the positive reviews, I doubt that the posters recognize what happened ""behind the scenes"" with their hard drive and operating system (see last paragraph).  To be fair, the unit I received may have been defective, but keep reading....I received the product and downloaded the most recent software and drivers.  Went through the install process as described.  Tried scanning my first card.  The scan quality was so horrible that I think I may have received a defective unit.  Each scan looked like a blur of colors and lines.  After 10-15 tries, the software was able to pick up the NAMES (just the names!) on the business cards about 1 out of every 4 times.I decided to uninstall the software, and this is where things got messy.  The install program apparently installed multiple programs to Windows XP.  The main program is a resource hog. Uninstalling doesn't remove everything installed.  This is extremely sloppy programming and shows a lack of ""respect"" for customer's home computers. Even if I HAD received a defective unit, the software and install/uninstall experience deserve the 1 star.  If you are like me, and like to keep your computer clean and running well, the software with this product makes a mess of your hard drive and operating system.  I had to sift through my registry manually and run specialized software just to ensure that everything was removed- and I'm STILL not 100% that I've completely erased the traces of this software.  Even if I could get a new unit that actually scanned well, I wouldn't.  The software and install/uninstall process is just sloppy.  Inexcusably sloppy.",0,0
R2FI1ZCP8RNE88,"I never write reviews but I had to for this printer because it is the worst!  It worked well for about a month and then the printer heads started clogging and had to be constantly cleaned.  And it didn't just take one cleaning, it was usually 3-4.  Then it would print well for a SHORT time before there started to be lines and faded colors again - and now we are up to around 6-7 print head cleanings and the printing still doesn't look good.  I read from someone's review that cleaning the print heads uses up ink - maybe that will explain why just after I cleaned the print heads 6 times that my newly replaced yellow ink cartridge said it had to be replaced!  And it was when I was just printing a black and white copy - but the printer wouldn't print even that until the yellow ink was replaced.  The problem with printers is that you NEED to have them print reliably because it is always when you are printing something important that you NEED at the moment when they print garbage or refuse to print.  I will NEVER buy an Epson printer again. And I will NEVER buy another printer from Office Max because their sales people talked me into buying junk.  I should have known better and checked for reviews on my phone while in Office Max before buying this printer!

R281DLDU6DIC33,"I don't normally write reviews, but this product was so awful that I felt it was my duty to inform others.  My wife is a teacher and we rely on our home printer quite regularly. We previously had the HP Officejet 8600 series (2 different printers, and printheads went bad on each both times), and although both had hardware failures, they at least performed their basic functions.  We wanted to stick with HP because we find the ink replenishment to be convenient.  When we saw the 8720, we thought it would be an upgrade, but we were terribly disappointed.This printer cannot print on cardstock.  The specifications clearly state it supports cardstock (up to 110 lb card), however, when we tried printing on 100 lb cardstock we stumbled upon 2 different issues;1.) it was unable to print on the 100 lb cardstock consistently.  The image or document you print will be off-center on the page, and this issue is amplified if you try to print more than 1 copy. The more copies you try to print, the further off-center the pages will print, resulting in significant loss of paper and ink.2.) it was unable to print duplex.  you are completely unable to print 2-sided with cardstock.  the printer would feed 1 page, flip, and then report a jam as it attempted to print on the second side of a sheet.This printer is vastly overpriced as it cannot manage even the most basic of functions including printing on cardstock, and printing duplex. STAY AWAY!",0,0

RTW67S8PVSVBY,"This chair took a long time to put together and now I have to take it apart and return it.  The lower back support is just above the seat and the gap between the back and the seat is not as large as pictured.  When a person sits in it, the lower back support pushes against the person's bottom and not the lower back.  With the seat being made out of the same slippery mesh material as the back, for me this means that I feel like I am sitting too far forward in the chair and I feel like I am perpetually sliding forward off the seat.  There is no tilt up mechanism under the front of the seat to help with this.  This seat does have tilt backward, however, and has a tension adjustment on that tilt which is nice, and it also adjusts up and down but the material and the design make it impossible for me to use. The arms rests are low, but I expected this from other reviews. It also came with a dent on the top of one of the shiny silver chair legs. One other thing about the mesh material on the seat cover is that dirt can fall through the holes and sit there.  While waiting for customer support, my cat jumped on the seat and I noticed some kitty litter stuck under the material.  In theory, this seat would be nice if the back unit was higher up, if the seat material was less slippery and without holes, and if the front of the seat tilted back slightly or had an adjustment (though it would likely raise the price).  I understand that the chair is not expensive, but a cheap office supply store chair is more usable than this one for me.  Hopefully this review helps.",0,0

R10OYE1UIGFPRR,"I bought this on Sept. 10, 2015.  I had to call Epson to help set up the printer.  They only set it up for copy and fax so I had to call back to set it up to scan. The customer service reps are hard to understand.  They do not do a good job of explaining the set up process.  Maybe it is because they are just reading out of a manual like most overseas customer service reps do.  In March of 2016 I started having problems printing with the black ink.  The printer doesn't recognize the ink cartridges I installed.  I use only original Epson ink.  The black cartridge will not print correctly it skips lines when it prints.  The chamber that holds the ink cartridges can not be opened without forcing it open.  It slides so far over to the right that part of it is under a piece of plastic and the chamber door can't be opened properly.  I called Epson today and they are going to send me a refurbished printer.  They won't give me a refund and they won't send a new printer.  So, I am going to get someone else's problem just like someone will get my problem once they refurbish mine.  Obviously, this happens quite frequently.  The reason I bought this printer is because I read good things online about it.  Well they are not true!  It is very hard to operate. Every time you want to accomplish a task you have to go into the settings and change them.  Not user friendly.  The worse part is I cannot print with the black ink so I am waiting on a ""new"" REFURBISHED printer.  Good luck if you buy this printer.  I can't rate it ZERO stars or I would.  Epson is suppose to have good printers. NOT THIS MODEL!!!!!!",1,1
R141QBD6D7DANS,"So I bought an Epson WF-3620 a little over a year ago.  After a year, the ink got clogged and would not clean or work.  Tried a bunch of things and basically had to throw it away.  I thought it may have been my fault for not printing frequently enough to prevent the clogging.  I liked all the other features of the printer, so I foolishly went and bought another one.2 months later, the new one clogged too.  This time we had been printing once a week to prevent clogging.  Ah...but I bought the extra warranty from Target.  So all would be fine, right?  Not.Target said I have to go to Epson.  I call Epson and tech support proceeds to walk me through a multi-day tech support process to check and clean the heads.  After literally going through all the ink cartridges, $50-80 worth, they conclude that they will send me a new unit.  I complain along the way and tell them about all the ink we are going through.  I ask for replacement ink.  They don't care...tech support is foreigners and they don't seem to understand when someone speaking English is getting angry or frustrated.  Not their fault, it's Epson.I will never buy inkjet again, and definitely never Epson again.  I had a Canon pixma before...it lasted a couple of years, then printhead went bad.  Inkjets are worthless.I really believe it is a scam.  Now I see this Epson model has 25% bad ratings...and I'm on my 3rd one.  If I could write 1,000 reviews on how bad this is I would.  But Epson would just come out with another bad printer, get people to use it, sell their ink, and repeat the whole cycle again.  Hopefully it catches up to them...good products mean something.Stay away from this...and Epson!",0,0

I asked what was wrong with the first unit and they said it was MELTED. They also tell me that I need to turn off the power and unplug it at night because these units melt inside if they're left plugged in. WHAT??

Hoping that replacing with genuine HP cartridges will resolve the problem.5/15 update - Purchased, cleaned, & installed three genuine HP cartridges and the printer is back to working great. Updating rating to two stars since LD Products was prompt in responding to complaint and sent label to ship items back for full refund.",0,0
RBVKMQWCIF46C,"I bought this package of Hybrid Correction tape out of the rest of the brands I viewed because it came in a pack of 10 for what seemed to me a good deal. However, they do not work. After I used the first one possibly three times on one document it no longer worked, The tape twisted at the tip area and I could not get it to work. I tossed it and thought it may be a fluke. Now I opened the second pack and it is doing the very same thing. I do not enjoy writing and posting negative reviews, but I could find no way to contact the company prior to this writing. I wish they did work!",0,0

The software is user friendly and after some adjustments the two are working fine with the text I downloaded to the Name tags.  So some reason the Red LED name tag will not except the text.

R3638BX7ZC37AJ,"August 7, 2009 - UPDATEI have printed several pages since my first review and I am happy to report that the prints using the black inks have looked much better.  At the quality that I am receiving now, I would purchase these cartridges again.  I have used the cyan and yellow inks as well and have not had a problem with them.===============I received these in the mail.  They were individually wrapped GENERIC cartridges.  So were the colored ones that I ordered from the same company.  This is not what is pictured.  I opened one up today and the ink leaked all over my hands (Perhaps I squeezed it when I took off the plastic piece).  Anyway, I cleaned the cartridge up and placed it in my printer.

For the positive the scanning and network setup were easy.  That's it.The printing is a nightmare.  I never go on Amazon to review, but giving me low color ink cartridge after one black & white image is beyond ridiculous.  To make matters worse, you need to have all color and B&W Cartidges full in order to print ANYTHING.  I just bought new color ink to print one colorless doc and am willing to toss this thing because of the unnecessary frustration.  Stick with HP, never buying another Epson product again.",0,0
R3ECK53W87YFK6,"If I could give this ZERO stars, I would.I purchased this trimmer for my wedding invites, as I screenprinted mine by hand.The very first pull of this blade wouldn't cut through my paper, dislodged the blade from the runner and started cutting into the plastic paper holder. It took me about 20 minutes to attempt to fix it, and at that point the blade was running on the metal strip it was supposed to cut beside.Eventually I fixed it, but I had to cut each invitation one by one, 200 sheets with five different cards that had to be cut one by one because this hunk of junk can't handle more than one sheet at a time. I would have been better off with an exacto blade and a ruler.None of the cut edges of the paper are sharp, they're all ragged.

R1GOOUX9B1WR1H,"There's a reason ONE THIRD OF THE REVIEWS ON THIS PRINTER ARE ONE STAR.  THERE'S A REASON....ACTUALLY, SEVERAL REASONS.  Overall, it's a poorly designed piece of junk that does not perform reliably.  It's consistent, but unfortunately consistently lousy .Changing ink cartridges successfully has been a constant challenge.  It won't recognize replacement ink cartridges..Epson or clone...about half the time.  When working in a home office without other printers to turn to, that alone is reason to take a sledge hammer to this piece of junk.The default setting is for two sided printing.  I couldn't find how to change the default.  Called customer service, and through very broken English was told there was no way to change their arbitrary 2-sided default other than to manually uncheck 2-sided printing in the printer dialogue box MANUALLY FOR EVERY SINGLE DOCUMENT YOU WANT TO PRINT.  I found it hard to believe such a moronic process was the only option, so the following week I called back again with the same questions....how to set the default to one sided printing and was told the same answer I got on the prior call....in even harder to understand attempts at English language.I should have sent this loser back the first time it wouldn't recognize an Epson cartridge, which was the very first time a cartridge needed replacement....and almost every cartridge change since then.  In addition to the recognition problem, the gizmo that holds the ink cartridges is supposed to slide to the left when the machine is opened up, but it sometimes does and sometimes doesn't.  If it doesn't, it's very difficult to raise the lid over the cartridges as it's blocked by another part of the printer.  Did I mention lousy design??Bottom line:  steer clear of anything Epson.  Their poor excuse for customer service is only exceeded by the terrible design and poor quality of their products.",0,0

R2NCA0JHAV3HHG,"I have avoided writing this review.  The first one arrived promptly and well packaged.  When I go around to setting it up, it went crunch, crunch, crunch and said ET phone home.Amazon was very prompt at sending a replacement.Figuring mass production has a few problems some times, I was disappointed but please with Amazon's usual great service.  Unfortunately, family health problems keep me focused on important things not Epson related.SO.... about 45 days later it was time to setup the Epson.  And Crunch, Crunch, Crunch..I got to call Epson customer service.  I really don't mind that we don't speak the same language, but a lousy phone connection is really not to be excused.  After many repeated question, Sherlock decided I had a hardware failure.  And I thought Epson had a hardware failure.  The replacement arrived in a few days, it appeared new but in plain packaging.

RO97JSDY1D6EB,I actually chose this chair for the rose gold color but it turned out to be a decent chair!  It's very pretty and the rose gold is perfect!  It's not super plush...it sits me completely upright and seems as if it will support proper posture.  There is no lumbar adjustment but I think it will be sufficient for me in my home office.  Shipping was fast and assembly was easy.  I am not sure on the longevity but I will update my review if it doesn't hold up to daily use.UPDATE: I have been using this chair for over a month now and it certainly is not meant for full-time use.  The height adjustment doesn't stay where it is set- you sink slowly over the course of the day. The lack of support means this is a good chair for a casual office but it you work full-time from home like I do- this chair won't cut it.,0,0

RBX3V543VX7Y2,"I have owned this printer for about 1 year. I have had LOTS of issues with it. Often, (usually when I am the busiest) the printer loses wifi connectivity with my computer and with my husband's tablet suggesting it's the printer rather than the device which I'm attempting to print from that is the problem. I then have to uninstall then re-install the printer. Usually this works but it is time consuming. My second issue is the cost of the ink cartridges which if I buy locally is around $50 for the set. The printer will not allow me to use anything but the Epson brand. Even when installing the Epson brand cartridges often the printer wont recognize them and continues to tell me to install more cartridges. Sometimes I have an impt work report to print and the printer just refuses to recognize the full cartridges or wont print one of the colors. I am writing this review as my only recourse to defuse my frustration. I purchased new cartridges @ $50  and couldnt get the printer to accept them, called tech support and told them the printer reads the cartridge as empty. He suggested I buy another set then call back. He had no idea what the problem could be and since Epson ""assumes"" it is operator error he did not offer a refund on the cartridges. So I would be paying $100 for a $89.99 printer with no guarantee it would print!! Well, so I decided to write this review instead.",0,0

I'm sure that the card companies probably have something to do with this particular size Envelope being so overpriced because all the money being lost from people making their own cards.

R1HDUCABFSB0IO,"I'd try to send this back, but it's hardly worth the trouble. But while the product itself is fine, the ""4-strips"" actually turns out to be TWO, half-width strips--saying ""4-strips"" infers you would have four complete velcro-like, stick-to-each-other strips. But of course each ""strip"" is useless without a mate to stick to, so ""four"" is really TWO. In addition, unlike the Scotch branded product this is derived from, these strips are half the normal width sold at Amazon, or brick-and-mortar stores.Since I cannot tell whether this was intentionally vague, I haven't given a one-star review.

Although both shipments contained product boxes with previously used parts taped back up in a box that looked like it was thrown from a moving truck several times.

When putting this together there are 4 parts (corners with wheels).  The corners fit together where one side is larger than the other and fits into the other corner piece.  Both are then bolted together in (1) place.  This is not a sturdy design at all.  However, a drill and some extra bolts can solve this easily.My major problem with the second shipment is I was sent 3 of the same corner pieces which make this thing impossible to put together.  I say impossible, but I will make it work by drilling and adding bolts where I need to.This thing comes with some junk screw hardware so I will be drilling some extra holes for added support, and making this thing work for what I want.

Instead I was swayed by some review site to get this Epson. It's LOUDER by far, sometimes seems like it's going to throw itself off the table. I'll admit, it's faster than the Canon was. But the Epson ink is insanely expensive and runs out all the time even though we are extremely light users. Just had to order another $36 black cartridge. And they make it really hard to use remanufactured ones, which the Canon didn't seem to mind. My adice, Don't buy it.=====This isn't a printer, it's an ink selling machine.We don't print much. And we are told to change ink all the time. There's a little blinking light, bright and very annoying, and little alarms telling you to change ink long before you actually need to. The ink is expensive, unless you buy the off label brands, which Epson has kindly done everything it can to make impossible to use in its machines.I would much MUCH rather pay $20, $40, $60 more for the damned printer to NOT have to hassle with this every three weeks. I have to cover the little blinking light to work (since it blinks basically all the time, telling you to buy ink). I had a Cannon before that used ink much more slowly and wasn't such a dick about pushing you to buy... plus accepted off label brands. I hate these guys and will never buy another Epson product as a result of this.

R3DX0T2PM5XO8,"I've had this printer since July 2014. At first, it was great. I like the AIO feature & was happily printing, scanning, and copying for months. I have a Canon photo printer that prints great, but the ink can get really expensive. I sacrificed high quality printing for an every day printer that seemed to receive good reviews. However, the longevity of this printer is the problem. After a while, the print quality started failing. Prints were streaked, almost like a bad photo copier. I went through repeated head cleaning, but every nozzle check showed missing lines. I thought it might be a bad ink cartridge. I burned through almost 2 black XL cartridges trying to clean the print head. I only use Epson inks, so this is a costly venture. It wasn't worth it.

I didn't treat it roughly or even go camping or anything with it.  It was just on my keychain and I didn't use it much and one day it just fell a part.  I am waiting for the response from the seller but for now I have to give it a low rating because it broke on me and I haven't treated it roughly what so ever.,0,0

RPTST1UL21YJ0,"Hi,I hate writing bad reviews, I really do, but it needs to be said.Please read this company's policies THOROUGHLY before you do business with them.  I've found out the hard way that they don't support cancellations if, say, you're wandering around in a Best Buy not even an hour later for work related items, and find this exact same product for not only two dollars cheaper than their asking price, but obviously, in a far more convenient format (just so you know, I got on my phone and attempted to cancel my order right that minute.  At that point, less than an hour had passed since I placed my order).  They haven't even thought about shipping it yet, but I can't cancel my order.  Why?  Their rep said that the whole process is automated and therefore can't be stopped.  Words.. I don't have words to describe how fishy that sounds.So.  Now I have to wait for it to be shipped to me.  Who knows when?  Then I have to process a return because they don't do cancellations.  Do they pay for this return?  Oh... no.  You do.  For all you people out there looking for a convenient solution to your ink depletion problem, look no further than Best Buy.  Seriously.  No hassle, get what you want right then for $11 and some change (with shipping costs, this is actually a lot cheaper.  I also live in SF these days, which means if it's cheaper in stores here, it might be even cheaper at your local store).Again, I hate being that jerk, but please save yourself the headache and shop elsewhere.Original message I received from them after I sent my cancellation request:""Our apologies, but once Amazon has released an order to us we are unable to stop, edit, or to cancel it. We have totally automated the order process for Amazon orders and they are downloaded and processed before we can retrieve them to cancel them. We suggest that you contact us immediately after you receive the shipment to process the return."".",0,0
RAKEEOPASYY5Q,"This is without a doubt, the slowest printer I have ever tried.  I just replaced an Epson WF-630 which is by far speedier than this one.  I wish Amazon allowed a video review because I would love to show just how slow it is.  A full page color print takes over a minute to print so I don't know out from where Epson pulled that 10 pages per minute statistic but it is a blatant lie!  Yes it is easy to use but everything moves slowly and it makes horrible noises while its pulling it self together to get ready for a print job.If speed is what you are looking for, this isn't it.

I would have preferred the envelope didn't have any windows - so I could print on the envelope directly and the customer wouldn't have issue aligning the address to the window.Envelope #2 ~ The glue came completely; it wouldn't seal.Envelope #3 ~ Was sent out and has yet to be received by the intended recipient.

ROZE7R6NBYXN,"UPDATE:I finally gave up on this chair mat. Even with a professional heat gun, heating it up then weighing it down on the floor, it returns to a rolled position if taken off the floor and curls at the edges when on the floor after it cools. I don't know how they managed to convince this mat that its natural state is ""curled up in a useless roll"" but that's how it is. I ended up filing for a return/refund on Amazon. DO NOT recommend buying this item.ORIGINAL REVIEW:Don't make the mistake I did and think that you don't need to check reviews for something as simple as a chair mat. Apparently, it's completely possible for a company to mess up such a basic product! It has a bit of a smell, though that seemed to go away after laying it out in the sun for a few hours, but that's not the real problem.It came so tightly rolled that it required the help of another person just to unbox the thing and ATTEMPT to lay it flat. But it will not lay flat, no matter what I do. Heat? Nope. Pressure? As soon as that's removed, it rolls back up again. It also isn't particularly secure on the carpeting, because the little pegs on the bottom are short and rounded - they don't GRIP the carpeting.Right now, I'm holding it down with some heavy items on all the edges, hoping to train this thing to stop rolling, but I highly doubt that'll work. If it doesn't, I might have to return this failure of a mat. Otherwise, I might relegate it to the hard floor in the workshop. It isn't useful for carpet, which I bought it for. HIGHLY disappointed.",0,0

RSPXJ9KQR85FK,"I wanted to like this printer. It does everything I need a printer to do and it is economical when it comes to ink. I read numerous reviews prior to purchase. My previous printer was an Epson Stylus NX115. Photos looked great and documents looked great. I had no real problems with it other than it was an ink sucker. When it finally began having issues after getting old, I tossed it and purchased the WF-3620. From day I had problems. For one, just about any photo you print will feed from the feeder instead of the rear feed slot. This is not just a matter of settings. I attempted to contact Epson customer service about this issue a few times and never once received a response. So when I want to print a 4x6 photo, I must remove the whole feeder cassette, remove the up to 250 sheets of plain white paper, and place my photo paper in the cassette. Then I reinstall the cassette and tell it I added 4x6 photo paper. Trying to do this to the rear feeder will just give an error telling you that you asking it to print on the wrong size paper and it will spit out your blank sheet of photo paper and print on plain white paper. Why the rear feeder exists, I have no clue, as I have been unsuccessful in using it in any sort of useful manner.Assuming I am not computer literate and this is just user error, you may still be tempted to press on. ""It won't be like that for me"" you might say. ""I know how to configure these things properly"". This would have been my reaction (I am one of the IT people at my work and it is my job to configure new workstations, printers, etc, while the more experienced people handle the server, access lists, etc).Print quality for photos is passable but not as good as the Stylus was. It is faster and has all the new ""cloud"" features, allowing you to upload scans directly to dropbox or print from some other geographic area (why people need to do this I havent quite figured out). Documents never looked real great. They always were a bit blurry and obviously not from a laser printer. Definitely not professional quality. After a few months the document printing looked so bad I was willing to spend all day aligning and cleaning heads. Finally after numerous (hours) attempts, I gave up and completely changed out the ink cartridges even though the ones I had were only about 3 weeks old. The print head had developed a smear. No setting would fix it. I tried to trick it by telling it I was using thicker paper and that didn't work either.I then went to where I bought it (Staples) and looked for a new printer. I had no intention of buying another 3620. When the salesman came by I asked about printers and eventually the story came out. He asked where I bought it. I said here.He says bring it in. I say its out of warranty and used. He says bring it in and Ill swap it out. SO I did.The replacement has not developed a smear but it does not print professional quality documents even on its finest setting. Mixed photos and text leave obvious lines in the photos and color bands. Text not dark and sharp. Using only Epson ink at first did not make it better. I switched to a different brand. Everything exactly the same. It's not a bad printer. I wouldn't call it bad. It just isn't real good.,And I'm still waiting for Epson customer service to respond to my emails from 04/2015......I'll edit if I hear from them but don't hold your breath. I uploaded a sample print on Normal quality setting black and white. Notice the banding on the photos.",0,0

R1EY7XP2VRHWFY,"I ordered this to replace another that I've had for a couple years. This obviously works a little better, as it has a new blade. I actually really like the wire, it makes cutting a lot more accurate than my old one. I can cut two-three pages at a time and it looks great, but more than that, it starts to look a little like an older blade made the cutting, with the slightly fuzzy edges. Picture paper worked well, but I'd really like to find one that has crisp, clean edges. I might need to go up in price range, and I would say for the price this is probably as good as it gets.UPDATE: Just one day after leaving the previous review, I cut two more sheets of paper, individually, and the paper tore on the second sheet. I've only cut about twenty sheets of 20 lb. paper with this, and two or three sheets of photo paper. Not enough to dull a titanium blade this badly. Also, the last half inch or so is curved instead of straight. No idea what happened in between, but, it now makes my old one look great. I'll be returning as I haven't had this a complete week yet.

This tape, clear and sticky, was difficult to remove, and the little that I diod get off the product left a thick, sticky residue behind. It would've taken a few hours to clean the cart, since the tape was on every surface. (see photos) What a thoughtless way to ruin a perfectly serviceable product. And yes, it does stink too. Needless to say, I returned it. I'm not sure who has enough time and will to dedicate a whole day to cleaning of a new product, but I sure think that it ought to arrive clean.  Also, I've never seen a worse packing job from Amazon. I had to use an entire roll of packing tape to get the package back into some approximation of a box to send this thing back.

R19WQ6IWZ203ME,"I found two faults which wasted a lot of expensively printed paper - and then I looked at the critical reviews. I should have looked before ordering but I mistakenly thought that at the high price it should be the best.I confirm the design defects which have been reported by other reviewers:1) This stapler is not suitable for a brochure comprising two or three sheets of paper which are to be folded to create a 4 or 8 page booklet. The reason for this is that there is always one leg of the staple which gets folded too far, pushing it back through so that it protrudes through the spine of the booklet. If you don't mind being restricted to producing booklets with more than 12 pages then this first defect may or may not apply. However, by the time I had wasted hours printing and destroying brochures due to the staplers ineptness I had no motivation to experiment with more sheets to see how many it needed before it did what it was supposed to do.2) The guide does not hold it's position.

This item prominently displays such a 'review' on this site, also raving about how this is no ordinary pencil sharpener but SOMETHING SPECIAL YOU NEED.No you don't need this. It is an ordinary pencil sharpener, nothing special whatsoever. The very top positive review claims its SPECIAL because its round shape prevents breakage, as long as you know as much as he does about utilizing its SPECIAL ROUNDNESS. No, it doesn't prevent breakage, no matter how you turn the device, the color pencils still break. Thats because Prismacolor pencils are known to break easily and this sharpener is no better then any other. Also, over time the blades get dull, and the duller they get the more breakage happens. I reached a point where I thought, oh look the sharpener blades have screws in them, I'll just remove them, and put in fresh blades,  like I can do with any Dollar store sharpener. But no, the screws don't come out. Who makes things with non removable screws??? Sorry but there is a kind of cynicism on the part of the manufacturer here to make it look like they can be taken out and replaced, when they  cannot, and when most other sharpeners the screws come out. In addition they have the metal sharpener itself fixed in place by the screws, so its non removable too. So now I have to toss the whole thing into the trash, adding to the waste stream. Many artists care about the environment and try to reduce adding plastic to the garbage. The manufacturer couldn't care less by making it impossible to avoid.

I bought this thing three years ago. I've always had print quality issues with it. Never used aftermarket, always OEM ink. Always fighting with the stupid print quality and lines. Heck, I probably burned through an entire set of cartridges just printing test pages and alignment pages. It seems to burn through the ink faster than it should when it would work. When I'm VPN'ed into another network for whatever reason it breaks printing on this guy until I disconnect and then the queued job will go through. Other printers don't have this issue.I'm about ready to take a sledgehammer to it right now because I'm trying to get the driver installed on my second laptop just so I can scan some invoices to email to a client and I've been fighting with the stupid installer for an hour now. First it detects the printer, but then can't ""contact"" it. I finally realize it's probably my VPN. Get off of that and now it detects just fine, but during the install wants to update the firmware. Fine. Only it fails for whatever reason. Then it just won't continue finishing installing the printer and scan driver.I will never ever shop an Epson again. This thing is such a piece of $#!7...",0,0
R8S0TBA0BMN8Q,"I have ordered this product for work multiple times and decided to order for my home office.  I loved my first order, however my husband had to work from home and ended up spilling a whole cup of coffee on it. Loved the first one, so I decided to place a reorder of the same item. My first order was in December of 2020 and this order was from February 2021.  I have attached the following pictures.  The ones with the wood background are the old pad, the ones with plastic are the one I just received ant the last one with the black background is the image on the item in amazon.  As you can see the product is not the same.  The paper in the mat itself was just fine and seemed like it was the same thickness as the first order.  However, the corners appearance and quality is way different.  The first one definitely  had more contrast, was thinker (padded) and as you can see on the back pictures a complete secure back.  The 2nd one is more of a dull brown, no contrast at all, and the back of the corners are the edges flopped over and poorly glued.  They do not have an image of the back on the product listing in amazon, however as you can see from the front image the color and contrast is definitely there.  I am not one to write bad reviews but was so shocked by the difference in look and quality.  Same price, same description, same pictures on listing but definitely not the same product at all.",0,0
R33W0UOY1BHFK5,"I have never given anything a 1 star review but I feel compelled to do so for this pencil sharpener!  I even suspect it's a fake Derwent.  It worked for about a month (I sharpen a pencil maybe 4 times a week), then it has the problem of the holder not working.  The part where it holds the pencil in for sharpening snaps back as soon as I turn the sharpening handle.  The pencil is then no longer held in place.  I tried to manually push the pencil in while turning the sharpening handle, and that does not work either.I bought the product, when it stopped working I did an exchange.  A new one came and it worked for a while.  Then just as my return window closed it stopped working, giving me the same problems as the old one!!!

R2XO26BMA6YDCA,"Bought this printer less than a year ago based on the raving reviews online. In summary, when the printer is working it is a pretty good one. Prints relatively fast, easy to setup, and pictures come out fairly nicely. It is relatively large but I was concerned about the longevity of the product since it appeared to be well ummm, cheaply made. Well, after several months, an error message 0X10-Scanning error started to pop up and on start up the things shakes like crazy. It tells you to turn off the computer and turn back on for the fix just to get the same thing happening again. Called technical support and they determined it was a hardware issue like I originally thought. So basically my fears came to fruition. It appears another reviewer and probably more wrote about a similar problem. Epson said they would replace it upon receiving the defective one since it is under warranty but I'm trying to get a full refund and buy something else that will last. Luckily I kept my old cannon printer which has lasted over 1 year while I transition. Would not recommend and would not trust an epson printer again.",0,0

I went to grab my papers and most of the ink had disappeared :( I then read the package that the pen shouldn't be left in the heat because it is heat sensitive...but I hadn't read that before and didn't think it would mean that my ink would disappear for good from the paper! I didn't even put the two together at first because I was drawn to the erasable fact and never really read the names of pens..so ""friction"" is really true to the name!

R20M5H8RGK884O,"Shipped in a box for best protection however box was mishandled, smoosed, and had one corner dented with a small hole. The boards were slightly curved but not bad enough to return and wasn't attributed to mishandling. Some of the boards corners had slight indentations.  Was able to straighten out most of the curve by placing boards underneath a heavy book. They straighten out quicker by gently bending by hand individually or 5 at a time. The measurements were accurate as described on Amazon. If the bags were slightly wider and the boards completetly straight I'd up my rating to 4 because not all of the bags were clear.  Holding each bag up to a light I saw some imperfections. None of the boards were chemically treated evenly on the one side. When looking at chemical side up and tilted so when the light shined on it could see the chemical visible and it wasn't evenly distributed on the board and was uneven with patches-blotches. You would never notice just by casually looking at the bags and boards.The boards did fit the bags with space to put the comic with a little wiggle room and will accomodate  regular comics but not silver.  I will use these bags and boards for regular common comics.The price was only $22 and a couple of days later see the price went up to $37.Even though Amazon backs their products including 3rd parties, has excellent customer service, and has my back for a return and refund due to no fault of my own I plan to to purchase comic book bags and boards at my comic book store so I'll see exactly what I'm getting and have no surprises!!",0,0

RU0CDTLQ3TGE3,"It is my first time I am giving something less than 4 stars and there are several reasons for that.First of all, be careful about the screw cap. I was playing with the pen with the excitement of the nice thing I got for the price and the cap got stuck. How is it possible? Let me explain. Anytime you force to open the cap, the screw for the cartridge part turns open. So there was no way to open the cap unless you try something like claw like tool. Or you just pull it hard and it is no longer a screw cap. I am effectively using it as a regular clip cap right now.However, I accept that was mostly me being novice. The real problem was the writing mechanism. I bought the FP with medium nib(I don`t even know if you have any other option). But if you have the option certainly buy a fine nib or sth. That is because, it literally wastes the ink. I have heard it being a wet pen but I was not expecting it to such degree. I bought jinhao cartridges along with this pen and I finished a cartridge with like every 4-5 journal-large pages. I don`t think it is something specific to the pen I had, it is most probably the character of the pen. Medium nib combined with the wet style; you will not be using the pen for a long session.Actually it does not matter the ink is enough or not, bcs you will not be writing long sessions with this pen, anyway. It is heaviest thing I have written with so far and that includes large chalks I was using while I was in school. It is really tiring to write. Trust me, you will have extra muscle on the arm(not hand) that you write with.You can always ask why I am complaining so much for a pen that I paid so little. Actually the two stars it is getting is because I am being fair to the price. Whatever the price is, don`t waste your money if you are actually planning to write with. Because you will not. The only fair reason to buy this pen might be to break it apart so you can get associated yourself with the structure of the fountain pen.",0,0

Five stars is just too much for a cheap pen. That said, these pens hold up very well to everyday use.

The ink cartridges were dried up and it would not print in color. I contacted the seller and told them the problem. They sent me an RMA to send it back instead of a few ink cartridges. I bought them myself. It started printing in color although the quality was not very good. I was in a bind for a printer so I made it work MY MISTAKE!!. I expected the quality to get better.

The Bluetooth interface drops the job even when I am close by.Problem 5. When you chose best quality it goes HYPER-SLOW. When you use standard quality the document is washed out. I have done head cleaning g routines many times with no or little improvement.I liked the description of the printer. I liked the reviews.

But like all the other reviews here, the print head is clogged quickly and the ink dries very quickly inside the printer. If you print every day this might be ok, but I go weeks or months without needing to print.Sent in once to warranty to have it fixed, came back and only worked for another week. Unfortunately the warranty ran out and now stuck with a heap of plastic.Wouldn't buy another Epson product again. Wish I could have my money back.",0,0

RW0PRXCUI4N9A,"Opened the black and got ink all over my fingers, so be careful. My HP printer keeps telling me that it is not an approved cartilage and cant guarantee product and so on. It also shows a yellow warning basically not saying I have an ink cartilage in there.  I printed a page and it was okay. It had a smear on the page and a few letters are do dark you can see them clearly on the other side. I can only speculate what it will be like the more I print things and when I go to remove it. I have not added any of the others so I don't know what will happen than. So I may be back to re-evaluate this product.

R3LYM4544902TT,"Like a couple of other people have mentioned, these are too small to be called #0. We sell DVDs and have purchased tens of thousands of bubble mailers from various manufacturers. A DVD will barely fit in these. When we ship a DVD, we include literature with a rubber band around it. It's like torture getting these in there.And again like another reviewer said, the bubbles are very flat and there just isn't that much protection.The adhesive is another problem. It is not evenly distributed and there are often streaks or even blank areas which has required us to use tape to make sure they stay shut.To sum it up, they're pretty much useless. Better to spend a little more and get a quality mailer that is the correct size, cushioning and adhesive quality.",0,0
RDTBCGZSZMEAZ,"Since I'm not able to reply or comment on other people's negative reviews.  I've been in the digital printing business (copiers) for over 30 years so this is in response to those people a d to everyone else.  If the toner smears after you run labels or any other thicker stock through your home laser printer or a walkup type copier.... it's not the fault of the label material.  It's your printer or copier.The toner (ink) isn't ""fusing"" to the material.. meaning your laser printer or copper's ""fuser"" system (the hot part that melts the toner to the material) doesn't get hot enough to properly adhere the toner to the label stock.  Again.... it's not the label material causing this.I've personally ran over 100 million copies.  If the toner is smearing you need to print the labels on a larger copier that has the ability to select ""heavy weight"" stock.  By doing this.... it heats up the fuse to a hotter temp (600 degrees or more) a d make the material run slower through the fuse unit.  Then the toner won't smear on these labels.  Hope this helps everyone.",0,0

The second cartridge worked just fine. Good fit and no noticeable difference in print quality from the OEM cartridge it replaced. Unfortunately, I'll need to send both back as part of the return but I will still order this again and see if the next 2-pack I get has two good cartridges.EDIT 9 Jan 2016 (changed from 3 stars to 1 star): My replacement order arrived and guess what...the SAME EXACT THING HAPPENED!

R2BSIVTURKGIP,"It's a sad comment on our collective standards that this printer is rated 4 stars and a top pick at my favorite gadget review site. I bought it to replace my 6-year-old Canon all-in-one expecting the technology to have jumped ahead by leaps and bounds and was shocked that the Epson was worse in almost every way.Photo printing - Washed out and extremely slow to print.Loading trays - There are two, but the rear one is only for envelopes and labels. If you want to print photos, you have to remove all of the letter-sized paper and replace it with photo paper, then swap them back when you're done. IMO this defeats the purpose of having to loading trays.Touch screen - It's the mushy type that you have to press really hard against.Interface - The setup menus are many and difficult to use.Build quality - Made of cheap plastic and feels flimsy.Document printing - The only aspect I was satisfied with. Fast and crisp.I ended up returning the Epson and instead got a Canon MG7520. The difference is like night & day.",0,0

You would think thatreplacing a GK420t printer with another GK420t printer would be easy. If you need a printer that will connect to younetwork do not buy the GK420t. Buy the GK420d printer.  This one has the ethernet connection.I noticed that they intended to sent me exactly what I was returning, two GK420t printers. So I canceled that order and ordered the correct printers.

RN1I35236KUUZ,"This ink immediately threw a Canon error B504 upon installation. Unfortunately, this error typically requires replacement of the entire printer since this line of Canon printers do not allow you to remove a cartridge until it is empty. I happen to know a work-around to remove the full cartridges, and am hopeful that replacing them with Canon cartridges will save my printer. Amazon has agreed to process a return for this product, and hopefully everything will work out, but I can't in good conscience recommend this product to anyone after my experience.Update 9/6/2017- I received an email from Kingway this morning. The Kingway representative asked that I process my refund through Kingway directly instead of through Amazon. They said that if I processed the refund through them, they would not require me to return the cartridges, and in exchange they wanted me to delete my 1 star review. The Kingway representative said that s/he was a new employee on their probation period, and needed my help to keep their job, and that the negative review was influencing their working performance. They also offered a workaround to remove the B504 error.Their workaround to the B504 error did not work and would be completely unhelpful to a normal consumer that does not know how to remove the cartridges while full. In addition, I told the Kingway representative that I would prefer to process my return via Amazon and that I would not remove my 1 star review.

The cartridges arrived and were mounted in a styrofoam holder and they each had a simple black plastic sleeve over them. The instructions mentioned a pull tab for each of the 4 cartridges.  None of the cartridges had a pull tab. I think that is / was the problem as the manufacturer must have skipped that step. I installed them, ran some test pages and there was a noticeable leak of toner on the pages so I had the HP clean itself. This did not help.

The colors still bleed and run, obscuring my writing. The only way to stop this is to hold the pen perfectly vertical and barely push when writing (translation: can't be done comfortably). On top of that, several of them are drying up with nowhere near the amount of use my Expo's got.",0,0
R33VZEAOKPEO3R,"I have owned and used this chair daily, spending many hours each day in it, for more than three years. I think that gives me ample experience with the product, so I decided it was time to write this review.Don't buy it.The Aeron Chair is marketed based on its ergonomics and customizable features. This chair, despite the hefty price tag, does not have most of the adjustability, and unless your body just happens to fit the shape and size of the basic chair as-is, and unless you do not mind the fact that you have no control over the tilt, you will hurt after a while of using it.OK, point-by-point:The chair back - in rest position, the angle that the chair back makes with the seat is too great to contact your back in an upright position for keyboarding, so you may find that you will spend most of your time perching on the chair without any back support.Lumbar support - this comes as a separate gizmo that can be purchased extra, but it isn't furnished with the basic chair.Tilt - The chair tilts, but you cannot adjust the tension, and there is no tilt lock. I repeat, THERE IS NO TILT LOCK. When you lean back, you will lean back very, very far - too far for comfort. Also, the back is not high enough to support your head or neck when you lean back, so forget using that extreme lean to rest your tired back and neck muscles while on the phone. I found this chair to be extremely hard on my neck for these reasons.The armrests - are not adjustable. I am a mere 5'8"" and they are too low for me, so my arms are completely unsupported. Will yours be? If your arms are not supported as you work, you will fatigue more quickly and your posture will suffer. Other reviewers have mentioned taking the chair apart to adjust the armrests. That's a great hack if you can do it, but I will leave it to you to decide if you have the skill and tools to disassemble the components of this chair to make the arms do what chair arms are supposed to do.The seat - the much-vaunted waterfall front of the Aeron chair seems to be either loved or hated. After all these years, I find that I hate it. It places much too much pressure on the backs of my legs, and that quite simply hurts. I ended up putting a cheap memory foam cushion on my expensive chair. (Note, I have the fully-loaded, top-of-the-line adjustable Aeron at work, and in this respect, it is no different. I had to get a cheap cushion for that one too.)The pneumatic height adjustment - works fine. It's nice to have one positive thing to say about this chair.In summary, the Aeron Chair's reputation is staked on its adjustability and good ergonomics, but the basic Aeron has neither.",0,0

Don't really know but it stopped printing in color cleanly after 1 month and stopped printing cyan. Can only return for 30 days so avoid this printer. Even after days of cleaning and all new cartridges still not printing. EPSON Printer Cartridges are also more expensive than you think because they do not last as long. In addition, printer doesn't have a draft mode so it uses a lot of ink every time.

R1YG17QYV36DUL,"Although these bags and boards seem of good quality (I'm no expert), I found that 15 out of the 100 bags were too small for the boards by anywhere between 1/8"" to maybe 2""! Yes, 2"" short of the stated width. I thought they were for oversized baseball cards or something.I could forgive one or two of the bags being like this, but 15% of them? Way too high of a failure rate, and now I have at least a dozen unbagged comics. I'm not really inclined to order another 100 for this. If you still want to order this product, keep this factor in mind and get more than you need, or just buy from a different manufacturer that has better quality control.",0,0

R20TVNCIND72FH,"When I first started using the pen, I loved it. It wrote smoothly and the fine tip was perfect for my handwriting as I write extremely small. It wasn't heavy to write with either and the grip was comfortable to write with. I rate this 2 stars because I actually really loved the pen when it was working. After about a week, the pen started writing choppy, as if the ink wasn't working. It was no longer smooth to write with and I'd be mid-writing and nothing would even come out. It became progressively frustrating to work with. This was with both pens too. Not sure if I got a faulty set of pens, but for the price I was extremely disappointed that I didn't even get a week in with this pen before it started not working for me. I feel like I seriously got ripped off. Will not buy again.",0,0
R1DZLWE6CSS26J,"I would have given this pen 5 stars if it did not run out of ink after a month. I bought a black and blue Frixion Ball pen to use for writing notes. After a month, the blue pen ran out of ink and shortly later the black pen. I decided I would give it one more try using the refillable ink. Less than 3 weeks later, the black pen ran out of ink. This is a horrible product. I don't understand how it gets 5 stars. Another friend experienced the same think with the black, blue, and RED pens. I contacted Pilot to let them know about the problem I had with their pens.Pilot's response to my compliant:The FriXion erasable gel ink pens and highlighters have a new kind of thermo-sensitive ink that is designed to write smoothly and erase cleanly.  The FriXion ink refill has been designed to deliver optimal ink performance.  As a result, the write out of our FriXion pens is approximately 1045 ft.I guess I'll return back to my faithful Pilot G-2 07 pen. Has anyone else had these problems or is it an isolated incident with the Pilot Frixion ball pens?",0,0
R2S8X5AVUFFYNL,Don’t discount the poor reviews I did and I regret it.The MFC machine is great when it’s functioning. The double-sided printing in color is fantastic. however when you have to unplug and plug it in to get recognized on the network for bonjour printing with Apple products it’s a little frustrating.  Every time I want to print I have to unplug it and wait  for it to shut down then plug it in and wait for it to start up and be recognized on the network.  At this point the only thing we want is for the Airprint function to work.  HP let the warranty run out and now just refuses to provide help. I’m looking forward to my next printer that will not be an HP.,0,0

R12XZKQJJG3E8S,"I was disappointed by this product. It’s very sensitive, and I had major problems with air bubbles when applying to the cutting mat - so many bubbles. And then when cut, because the stickiness is so sub-par, the pieces start to curl or move from their original positions.I was excited about the good price, but it really did affect the appeal of my new labels. However, I will note that this seems to work better for very large images/cuts rather than smaller ones. So, if you’re trying to do very large pieces, it may be worth it.Edited to Add: I realized after I completed the review and was searching for other brands…that maybe this wasn’t meant for use in a Cricut, as so many of the other search results were not. Clearly, I wasn’t paying close attention when I was buying. Still! Definitely don’t recommend it for a cutting machine!",0,0
R3A9G1QSFY0EMF,"This printer will be great for the first year, maybe first year and a half that you own it. Then the print head will start to fail, and you get ""smudgy"" printed results and ""missing dots"" on the print-head test. (Yes, I've ran the print head cleaning utility countless times and swapped in new ink cartridges and it never fixes the problem.)I'm on my fourth one now in 3 years. It's nicer when they fail before the first year is up, because then you can get it replaced under warranty after spending a few hours of your time dealing with their customer support and tech support departments. Of course, you're out of a printer for the 8 weeks or so that they take to ship and refurbish and send back. But when your unit lasts a little longer than one year, your warranty has already expired and it's probably cheaper at that point to throw it in a landfill and buy a new one.Sometimes you might get lucky and find this model on sale at a big box or office supply store for around a hundred dollars, at which price point it would be OK to keep throwing them away and replacing them every year or two. I wouldn't pay more than that for this model again. Fool me once! If you don't want the inconvenience I've described of having to keep replacing your printer, look elsewhere.In conclusion, I must say that despite the print head failures, this is really an excellent printer and I would give it a five-star rating if it weren't for my fourth one suffering the same exact fate as the others before it. This leads me to believe it's a design or manufacturing flaw, not just a lemon or unlucky experience. With that said, if I can find this printer on sale again for around a hundred dollars I would probably buy it again since I have so much ink for it. Printers these days just seem like disposable commodities, not so good for our environment or landfills but I don't know of any other alternatives for the small home/office user like myself.",0,0

R1YPBD5YYEMQVT,"I rarely give ""bad"" reviews so this is weird for me. When I got this calendar, I was so excited! I needed a new dry erase board calendar because my old one was starting to fall apart after 5 years of college and moving around and a couple bad hang-up jobs. I liked that this one was just a huge calendar and cork board in one and that it came color-coded for my meal planning, doctor appointments, events, etc. I also liked the lack of a frame because the frame is what started coming apart on my old one, which caused the dry erase part to slide over top of the cork board part at the bottom.When it arrived, the one corner was bent in. I was disappointed but it didn't seem like that big of a deal to me. I used command strips and hooks to hang it up rather than the hardware it came with because I live in an apartment and don't like putting holes in the walls if I don't have to and the board is really lightweight. I started to notice the cheapness of quality in the coming weeks. The cork board is so thin that it will only hold up maybe an index card with a push pin. I have a key ring pencil sharpener that I used to keep hung from the cork board on my old calendar on a bigger push pin, but this board won't hold it up longer than a day. Then I noticed the dry erase part started to bubble. This may be related to the corner dent I mentioned earlier, but either way I can't get the bubble out. The board itself or maybe the markers are also VERY sensitive. If I'm writing on the board and I'm not careful I'll wipe off 4 days without realizing it.Overall... great idea, but not executed properly in my opinion.** Edited: I did find these same dry erase boards in Target today and they looked fine - I think the reason my board warped so badly was because of the corner dent, but it looks like other reviewers experienced the same (why do I never trust bad reviews?!). However, I am not changing my rating because as it turns out from buying another board, this board does wipe off too easily (it's not the markers after all, although the markers go from fine tip to really smudgy with just a few uses) and the cork board was still thin and useless for me. Just wanted to make the update - if you're going to buy this product, try to find it in a store locally so that you can make sure it is free of defects in order to avoid wasting time and shipping money.",0,0
R1V804VW3CF4J1,"I bought this to replace a Canon printer that had broken after 5 years. First, let me say this looks like it could be a good all-in-one. The touchscreen is cool, it seems to print fast, setup was easy and connectivity with my Galaxy S5 worked great. The reason this gets only two stars though is because it arrived defective. The ADF (automatic document feeder I think) did not work correctly. With only a single page in place, it worked most of the time (MOST of the time, sometimes it still threw an error for no reason). With more than one page, the first page would be scanned fine, but the second would always (always!) cause the printer to show an error indicating a paper jam. I tried this about 100 times before contacting Epson. Epson was zero help and mentioned exchanging it. Well... if it's already having problems on day one - and I don't see any issues with the hardware, my guess is this will eventually happen with any of these. So, back it goes. I'll be buying a Canon again. Final note; the software it comes with for scanning appears antiquated. It wasn't even as robust as my old Canon's software. That's really sad.

It’s difficult to cut the tape and when you do, the remaining tape doesn’t stick to the cutter, it falls inside and sticks to the bottom. The cutting blade sticks straight up (the cutter on the tape dispenser I currently use sticks out with a flat portion on top before the blade) so I thought maybe if I bent the cutter forward, the remaining tape would have something to stick to. Nope again. Also, the sides of the organizer stick up so high that you can’t easily grab the tape to pull and cut, you have to slide your finger inside between the tape and the wall, which isn’t convenient. If you don’t do it right, you’ll push the tape off the cutter and down into the organizer again. The cutting blade isn’t secure in the unit either and can easily slide in or out. Should (hopefully) be able to secure it by clamping it with needle nose pliers. The metal is also pretty flimsy and bends easily, so one of the sorting slots was crooked when it arrived. The good thing about it being flimsy is that it was easy to bend the sorter back up. I'm honestly disappointed because I already have things to do what this organizer does (tape dispenser, pen holder, sorter etc.) but I thought this would be a perfect way to clean up my desk a bit.",0,0

RXFD7BOG6ATPM,"This is a very poorly designed product. I saw a few reviews saying their pens had broken but I hoped mine would be ok as the pictures of the pen look great. Once it arrived I took it out of the box and was very pleased with how it looked. As soon as I started using it however, the ink cartridge slipped into the body of the pen, which not only prevents the nib protruding as it should, but it also prevents the telescopic mechanism of the pen from fully closing. Very disappointed with this item.",0,0
R1VQBJP233HEVE,"For the price, I was hoping for perfection.  I don't know what to say, I still can't get used to it now 4 months later.  Two main issues, for me.1. Although I am somewhat sensitive to noise, I thought I could get over this, but I really can't.  If I could return it for a quieter version, I would.  This just doesn't belong in a home, more of an industrial sharpener, for offices maybe.2. When cleaning out the shavings, you take the silver disk off the top then lift the clear container up. Seems simple enough.  But if the shavings are more than 2 inches high up the cup, they don't stay in the cup and just fall out on to the table.  Highly annoying.Giving it 2 stars because it does at least sharpened pencils as promised.  Make sure to give everyone using it instructions on how to use it: put it in, sit back and WAIT for it to pop it back up at you when it's done. If you don't, you will only be aggravated at how difficult it is to pull it out yourself.  For me, I could send this back, I would.  I was hoping the money I was spending would have given me something fantastic.  Save your money, get something quieter.",0,0

R1ISZ6U5MY75AZ,This printer is extremely disappointing. Unless you have a lot of money to spend on ink cartridges that is. You must install all three colors and black ink for any type of printing to occur. The printer does not use all of the ink in the cartridge before it has a warning sign that you need to replace the cartridge and it will not print using Existing ink in other cartridges. Also the printer seems to think it needs a new cartridge of ink if you haven’t printed in a while which is very frustrating if you conserve and don’t print a lot like me. This printer has been a big waste of money I would never buy it again and I wouldn’t want anyone to rely on it. I gave it one star because I can’t give it zero,1,1
R2W4614D07JAN1,"I have had this printer for over 1 year now so I feel qualified to leave a review.  I am very unhappy with it.  It prints inconsistently, often with black streaks, and the color printing looks very unprofessional.  Color prints come out looking like you used a printer from 1999.  And yes, I am aware how to change the printer settings before I print to get ""fine"" and ""high quality"" prints.  Still bad.The scanner button on the printer has never worked. So to scan I have to go into my computer and find the printer on my computer, then scan through my computer.  It took me a long time to figure out this hack so that I could get the scanner to at least scan. A horrible printer, I wish I never bought.  I am not even going  to delve into the fact that EPSON printers don't allow you to use replacement ink refills, only their expensive EPSON refills. What??If you look at all the positive great reviews, they are from people receiving a free printer.  Yes if I got this free, I probably would have no complaints....why complain for something free? I mean, it does print sometimes. And you can hack it to scan.  And you can use EPSON ink cartridges.  But unfortunately , I had to use my hard earned dollars.  So if you are being offered this FREE, for your review, then yes go for it. If you have to pay, stay away.",0,0

R2O535MJY35F0I,"I have had this printer about 13 months. I bought this printer because it had separate ink for each color, I was tired of wasting ink just because one color ran out. Also because it is wireless.Good:When it works, it works ok.It's intuitive to use, all things considered.Printing is fairly fast.***UPDATE: I just wrote this review a few days ago and since then it has started printing uber slowly.Bad:It just won't pick up wireless print jobs most of the time unless I reboot it. It says its there and diagnostics say it works fine but nothing. Even Epson couldn't explain it.After about 6 months the power button will not turn the thing off or on (but it does ""wake it up""), so we have to unplug it to turn it off and back on again, which I would really never have to do if it printed right to begin with. Even after the re-plug, sometimes it will print, sometimes it won't.It takes a long time to turn on and seems to dump ink going through its checks each time. It's definitely an ink hog.The advanced settings are over-complicated. Even the Epson people kept saying ""I don't know why it's like this..."" while walking me through a fifteen minute procedure (when it was still under warranty) just to get the manual feed slot to work (the back slot where you can put special paper in, like envelopes). They did get it to work....once. I just don't use it anymore.Changing ink cartridges is VERY time consuming. I timed it once at TEN MINUTES that it had to sit and think and whir and think and click and think just to load a stupid new cartridge.It updates software FREQUENTLY and then often makes you reconfigure it each time. Each update tends to drop it from the network and I am TIRED of trying to print.Everything else on our network works fine. Each ""fix"" I apply works for about one print job then I am back to fighting it.Also, the scanner quality is poor.  The scanner top feed does not work. It scans the bed instead even though the display acknowledges you have a scan document ready in the feeder. Same issue as the back slot.The only reason I still have it is because I spent a lot of money on this, still have a lot of ink, and cannot afford a new one, so I keep rebooting it, reinstalling it, etc. I even tried installing it on different computers.I gave it two stars instead of one because, until the warranty ran out (less than 2 months ago), the Epson people were nice and helpful. Also because it worked pretty ok for about 6 months, though I was seriously disappointed at the color quality from day 1. We had a second printer for a while that was several years older (a cheap HP piece of crap that lasted longer than this thing) and it printed much better.UPDATE: just a few days later I am having more problems. Now it prints double-sided or single sided when it feels like it, not how you select to. Also, as noted above, it started printing very slowly. Everything is like in slow-motion on it, the paper intake, output, the actual printing. Also, the print quality got significantly worse despite new ink that I had purchased JUST before the major issues started. Ugh. Everything prints looking faded. I ran the print-head cleaner, etc. No improvement. Trying to keep it running until we use the ink then this is going to the recycle.",0,0
R1H63CBS0EQQ8I,"I debated remanufactured ink cartridges but the reviews convinced me to try, especially since the price difference was significant.  Once installed my printer recognized them as ""genuine refurbished HP cartridges"".

I reinstalled and everything was fine for a couple of printings then I got the message again.  Another reinstall worked for one printing.  Then the message ""incompatible ink cartridges"" appeared and a reinstall did nothing.  I researched and could find nothing to help.  Eventually I had to take them out and replace with regular (overpriced) HP cartridges, thereby spending more money in the long run because the remanufactured ones were full.  They would have been great value for the money had they worked.  The print quality seemed a little off.  It looked as though too much ink was used and the print looked ever so slightly fuzzy.

R58VLN8LKPJWT,"I have this really thick eyeliner pencil (Tarte SmolderEYES).  None of my regular sharpeners were big enough to handle it, and I really like the color, but it was getting to the point where I couldn't use it any longer.  I didn't want to pay for shipping from Tarte so I bought this.Well.  This mangled the end of my eyeliner pencil.  It didn't trim the wood part evenly and it completely crushed/smashed the eyeliner inside.  I lost probably a half inch of product trying to get this to work.  I held it in both hands, trying to see where I'd have better control of the pencil.  I held the pencil as straight as possible inside the hole.I think part of the problem was the blade was not sharp enough for this particular pencil (for which the wood part is fairly hard, to be sure).  At any rate, the smashing of the eyeliner part of the product all over the inside made the blade hard to clean, too.This *may* still work for pencils even larger than the Tarte SmolderEYES, where they can't wiggle around as much in the hole while you sharpen them.  It also may work for sharpening products that aren't as hard on the outside, and for products where the actual makeup part is firmer than with the Tarte product I was attempting to sharpen.  (I ended up buying the Tarte sharpener for two bucks.  Live and learn, I guess.)  I will save this because I may end up with a really thick cosmetic pencil one day, where this may come in handy.",0,0

RH3BTCZ8K8G69,"First of all, there's an amazing review here by ""Doctor.Generosity"" going over the problems with these printers guzzling ink then refusing to do anything until you buy ink. Please take a look at it: http://www.amazon.com/review/RZ9U43V2GQZ2/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JXLGF06I would like to address their reliability. These printers look amazing and work great, for about a year. This printer will print fantastic looking stuff for you, I promise. However, I've owned two other Epson printers, including a WorkForce, which both died in a year, under very light load-- a few pages a day max. Neither printer made it to ITS SECOND REAM OF PAPER. Both times the printers died, I was stuck with overpriced ink tanks I would never even get to use. Both printers jammed and stripped their gears. Making a printer which breaks over a simple paper jam is reprehensible! Epson's response was to offer me a discount on a new printer that would break.We need to stand up to this culture of disposable products that bully us into doing what they want (refusing to scan a document when its out of ink). Your best bet right now is a Brother or Samsung I would think. Vote with your wallet and don't put up with this.If you decide to buy this printer, know that you'll be buying a new one next year, and factor that into your decision about cost per page.",0,0
R13N79KDPWZ0CV,"I am not one to write reviews on products until i have had the time and opportunity to give the product a proper trial. We have owned this printer for 6 months, it is used on a regular basis but not daily. It is used for business purposes. The printer has never been one to stay connected to the wireless network, we do have the latest in tech for wireless broadcasting at 100 MBPS. I have spent a couple hours with Brothers tech support to no avail.Pros: When it does print it is clear and precise, fax works well and scanner is good.Cons: Hard on ink, we purchase the OEM ink by brother, it never gives the number of pages indicated by the product (1500). Rarely use the color ink, mostly black ink is used. But if one of the color cartridges runs out it will not print even though the black cartridge will be full.Purchasing any printer today in the market of a throw away society is a gamble. To do over I would not purchase this product.PS we do have and use another Brother printer that works as it should and it is two years old,",0,0
R2UHFQO4LI1X7K,"I have only tried to use the black cartridge so far, and the printer (HP Officejet 4500 G510n-z) refuses to print with message ""print cartridge problem : [black]..."" . There seems to be quality control issue at LD if something as simple as making a cartridge work for the printer it is intended for, is an issue. I wonder if I have wasted money on the other cartridge as well. I guess I will know when it is time to replace that as well...Unfortunately, one star is the lowest I can give...The Manufacturer/seller is not even bothering to respond to multiple concerns raised here. I wonder what Amazon has to say about this? The cartridge does not work, no matter what I tried - shutting the printer down, cleaning the cartridge contacts, etc. There is no way to refute the fact that this is a bad product.

R20WT7SUQQW7CU,"After searching several stores for a 2-hole pencil sharpener and coming up empty handed, I decided to search here.  This one got some great reviews so I was pretty excited even with the $7 price tag.  We desperately needed a 2-hole one for my kids' larger colored pencils.After a few weeks of use:I absolutely hate this sharpener!!!!It constantly breaks the lead.  You will finally get it to a point only to write with it and the lead falls out/breaks or sometimes you can't even get it out of the sharpener without the lead just falling out.  At first, I thought it was due to a particular pencil brand until I tried it on every brand of pencil we have and it does this with every single one.  What a waste of pencils when you think about having to sharpen a single one at least 3 times before you get a point you can actually write with and it not break.  I have many other sharpeners, much cheaper than this one, and have never had this problem with any of them.  I'm not a novice pencil sharpener either.  I like to draw and color with my favorite medium - pencils.  So I've probably sharpened double, if not triple, the number of pencils as the average person.  I find pencil sharpening to be pretty relaxing, but I'm not a fan of waste, whether it be time or resources, and re-sharpening the same pencil over and over again is just ridiculous.The shape of it actually hinders sharpening a bit - It hardly holds enough for one new pencil being sharpened and you can't see how much you've sharpened already because the shavings completely cover where you should be able to see.  I have many other 1-hole sharpeners with a different shape that I never have this problem with.The door....Oh, the door....I don't know why I originally thought this would be neat or a good idea.  It's awful!  It gets in the way.  You have to hold it open or it wants to collapse down onto the pencil you're sharpening and with pretty significant force too.  I wondered if this was the reason the pencil lead was breaking, however after holding it up for a bunch of pencils being sharpened, it didn't seem to make a difference.  It's just an annoying and unnecessary feature.  It's really irritating to have to open the spring-loaded door and hold it open to get the pencils in.  I'm assuming it's an added safety feature for young kids, but it's small enough for it to be a safety hazard around young kids anyway and with the easy to pull apart shavings compartment, what's the difference?The sharpener itself really doesn't seem that sharp either as it takes more force to get it to sharpen the pencil than others I have.  This could be why the lead continually breaks.My 6 year old has tried to use this sharpener and could not do it.  She has had no problems with other sharpeners, but she just can't sharpen pencils on her own with this one.I would not recommend this.  Look elsewhere for a user-friendly 2 hole pencil sharpener.  If I find one I like, I'll update my review with it.",0,0
R1BX15ISDA4YTK,"This seems to be a perfectly good chair mat. This would be a five star review, except Amazon, the manufacturer, or some intermediary has chosen to cover one of the stickers on this mat with a giant opaque black paper sticker that immediately shreds when you try to remove it, leading to hours of sticker-scraping fun.I don't know what that sticker said, but it must have been pretty horrible if they were willing to ruin the product to protect us from it.",0,0
R2I807YVNE4AYP,"Great for general home office use.  I don't print photos. Excellent at not, repeat not using large amounts of for ink periodic maintenance.  Allows me to scan multiple pictures at a time and place them into individual tiff or jpeg files in one step.  Duplex printing works well.  Copy functions allows for image preview of copy before you actually print the copy allowing you to make adjustments without wasting paper and ink.  I replaced a very thirsty Lexmark after 24 months use because it consumed large quantities of maintenance ink with this Epson.  I'm very satisfied.  If I could upgrade one thing I would like a larger led screen so I could more easily see copy previews.Downgrade: August 2018Have to downgrade this review.  This one lasted me 3 years of very light home use.  In the end, the print quality became very poor.  I purchased mine in February 2015,  It became unusable for printing this month.  In 2018, I was running nozzle cleaning every day before I could print.  Sometimes several times a day.  Over the last year, the print quality has fallen off so I replaced it with a  Brother Laser HL-L2370DW.  What a sweet deal.  I bought it at Best Buy for $99.00.  Toner cartridges cost $40.00.  Effective cost per page is 3.5 cents per PC Magazine which gave it an Editors Choice for 2018.  That's half the cost per page of an inkjet per Consumer Report with laser print quality.  I'm now using my Epson AIO for scanning when I need it.  It's not just Epson, I've owned HP and Lexmark as well.  If you study the Amazon reviews you'll find an unusually high number of 1 rated reviews on these types of machines.  The AIO concept results in inferior products, IMHO.",0,0

R352NY4RYSMZ6H,"I HATE THIS THING! This printer might work if all you care about is multi page feeding / scanning. That's the reason my husband bought it. We were in a hurry to get a new printer because our old one suddenly broke. We FAILED to read the reviews!I use printers primarily to print out pictures. This is by far the worst photo printer I've ever used! The quality (I'm using Epson cartridges, not even compatible generics. So there's no excuse!) is awful! I'm using the same photo papers I've been using for years, so no excuse there either. The photos are set to print on glossy photo papers and high quality, but there's no vivid photo option like some other printers, maybe because it's simply not capable of making anything thing ""vivid"". I'm having to drastically increased my photo contrast in order to make the photos look borderline acceptable. It also takes 4-5 minutes per 8.5x11 page of high quality photo printing. That is 4-5 min per page of awful noise I also have to put up with.The low ink cartridge notification is unrelenting. There's an orange light that would flash all day, all night, despite my acknowledging *OK*. Then when the printer decides the ink is actually out OUT, it stops printing and beeps. WHO DOES THAT?I'm trying to print some pictures out as I'm writing this review. F* this, I'm going out to buy a different printer today! And I'm not going to be getting an Epson!

R1PXK30C2FEEJD,"After one year of use, this printer met its demise with what Epson customer support is calling ""hardware failure"". Of course, it was just past warranty so Epson recommended a service center nearby (it will cost as much as a new printer). Every previous inkjet printer that I've owned (other brands), has lasted several years. I was drawn in by positive reviews not noticing the very common error message ""0x97"" which is a death warrant. Printer had a pleasant design and lots of nice features. No complaints about the printing quality. WiFi connectivity was buggy, constantly requiring reprogramming home network, but we put up with it. I'd recommend connecting via Ethernet cable for a more reliable network. You will pay through the nose for ink cartridges. Crazy how expense even black ink is. We paid over $265 for ink over a 9 month period and I don't consider my household to be heavy users. Going shopping for a new printer!",0,0

R2AT2PQNSJOUBY,"After reading some of the other reviews, it's possible that I just got a bad batch, but unfortunately the majority of these pencils weren't very sharp (to be specific, they had that terrible piece of wood that went up to the tip of the pencil on one half of the lead tip, leading it to only be 1/2 sharpened).I, like a few other reviewers, bought these for middle school students, but was disappointed because they would often need to sharpen them when they were given, which added way more time and somewhat defeated their purpose.Anyways, I went with the ""Dixon Golf Pencil"" by Ticonderoga for the same price and they were all really well sharpened straight out of the box.

R6VOIZ6010D5E,"Disappointing. I purchased this printer along with the extended warranty because it received good reviews. I wanted a reasonable duplex printer/scanner combo. First, it was difficult to set up wirelessly. Printers don't come with manuals anymore. After the installation failed twice, I phoned only to find out that I needed to use a notebook device to set up the printer with my computer. Really?!? The ink cartridges looked small. They worked fine the first time but, after replacement, the printer did not recognize the Magenta cartridge, which meant nothing prints. I went online to research it and tried the recommended troubleshooting tips. No success. I e-mailed Epson who made me repeat the troubleshooting to no avail. Finally, they tell me something is wrong and I must phone Epson. I told them I want this thing out of my house. They say I cannot return it but can only get a replacement. So I phone and the new person verifies the troubleshooting and tells me there is something wrong. They say I must give them a deposit to have the new printer sent. When I protest, they say I can send it (and pay shipping costs) and they will send the replacement upon receipt of the original. Epson employees conspicuously do not comment about the extended warranty. I think I must switch to Brother printers. I wish I could just return the Epson and be done with it. This is just sad.I received the replacement printer--a refurbished product. Sad. I finally got it installed wirelessly. (I hope you own an iPad.) It is having difficulty connecting to my devices. For example, I just sent a print job from my PC and it didn't print...until 5 minutes to later. The iPad also printed after two minutes. A Test Page gives me an error. It has been 5 minutes and a Webpage has still not printed. The last thing I want to do is talk to Tech Support again. I plan to ask someone at work to get the thing working.",0,0
R2YMEYMNR4I1QO,"Update/addon Well Epson finally sent a replacment WHICH LASTED LESS THAN 2 months itself before dying I will NEVER purchase, suggest, or use Epson printers again if it's my choice to do so. Origonal review below.I bought this for my home because it had reviews about how much cheaper the ink was and how good the printer itself was. WELL, I can tell you there must be a LOT of reviewers or people either getting paid by, compensated in some way, or work for Epson &/or someone else to get those reviews! I have 20 + years as an electronics tech and I HAVE never had as much trouble out of a printer EVEN the HUGE ones I do for local hospitals and data centers! So far had to fight this thing for 2-3 months because I cannot be without a printer at home, since I will have to send it to Epson or an Epson service center for the warranty/service and really don't have the time to travel to my office (10 miles one way) to use one for the kids to do homework or every time we need to print something etc. I really didn't want to buy one while I went this one for repair but due to it becoming useless on a daily basis now I guess I will have to and don't even ask about ink we print the same amount as the last one (an HP) and I go thru 3Xs as much ink and its COST just as much as the HP's ink did! I can guarantee I will NEVER purchase another EPSON if I have anything to say about it!

I bought it based on the other reviews, but I've been horribly disappointed by both the quality of the product and the customer service of the company.

I called their support and after listening to it beep they sent out another unit. The next unit lasted about a day and started doing the same thing. I tried contacting them again but they claim to never have received my email. (They received it before, so seems strange that all of a sudden they don't receive my emails.) So, I have to wait for a time when I can call them again. Now they say they can't send me another because it is past 30 days. So now I have to send it in to be repaired. I asked what was wrong with the first unit and they said it was MELTED. They also tell me that I need to turn off the power and unplug it at night because these units melt inside if they're left plugged in. WHAT?? Yep, they say they see melted boards because people leave them plugged in over night. Oh great, that seems like a really solid piece of equipment you're selling that can't stand being plugged in.

R26JJXDA8FYEFV,"If I could give negative stars I would.  Not only do these not work but, they actually damage your printer.  You can print with them but, the cartridges continually leak - giving you terrible splotchy output.  And instead of getting better, they leak worse and worse over time.  So, initially you keep going because you hope that things will get better but, they never do.  Things get bad quickly!  Eventually, you can barely read text because of how bad the output quality is.  Then you finally throw them out because you have given up.  Then, you put regular brother toner cartridges back in but, it's too late.  The bad toner ink has damaged your fuser roller.  Even though you cleaned the mess up, you will never get a decent page out of your printer ever again.  And, a new fuser assembly will cost more than the printers worth.

My biggest gripe is they do not provide an instruction book, only a start-up sheet - if you want the full instruction book, you have to try to find it online and print it yourself!

I was wishing they had example pages printed to make things more clearer and give me some inspiration.  Instead they included this small booklet that was so hard to read because the quality of the printing.  The lettering was so blurry I couldn't even read it.  I tried looking for something on Youtube, but all I got were product reviews.  They do have videos of a guy in front of a erasable board which still wasn't any help.  At the end of the day I was so frustrated, uninspired and overwhelmed.  A lot of the pages were redundant.  There's the month page, then you have the week by week page which is has more detail of each day but most of the stuff you wrote in the month page is repeated on the weekly set up.  It reminds me of the old fashioned day planners.  It was not what I was looking for at all.  I should have returned it, but decided to give it a go anyway.  I filled out a couple of pages but soon tired of it.  I got bored of writing in my weekly goals, then my daily goals which were my weekly goals.

R3W3IAVXJSJYCE,"As an Army vet myself I like to support my fellow veterans. This product looked like a nice way to keep up on things in my spare time by reviewing the cards during down time. The problem I have and why I cannot give a better rating is that there are lots, lots of typos, inaccuracies and missing information.First the deck could benefit from an acronym card defining all the acronyms used. You can’t expect people to learn anything if all you give them is a bunch of two letter bits of info.Secondly, the product was either hastily or sloppily put together because it is rife with typos and misspellings. Rangers hold themselves to a higher standard. These cards should reflect that. I mean seriously? You can’t be bothered to proofread them?The overall packaging and presentation is not bad, but I am seriously disappointed at the lack of quality control in terms of the information on the cards.In addition to fixing the typos and defining acronyms, there are a couple other things that could be incorporated to make this a quality product.I will be happy to give a better rating if the vendor improves this product. Let’s face it, this is quite a simple product so improvements should be easy. Reach out for advice if you are stuck vendor. Happy to help if you ask.",0,0

But when I put my first package on the scale to weigh it, probably about 2-3 lbs, it only gave me the weight in Kilograms or Ounces.This was not useful because I had to recalculate the conversion to pounds and still ended using a Flat rate priority mail box because I wasnt exactly sure of the weight.

R1A62TP1IP5R79,"All these Vine reviewers - do you actually use the printer/scanner?  Are you really being objective when you get the equip for free?Coming from Canon MX882 who's print quality has always been good.  Getting frustrated with document feed jams and how fast ink goes through on that unit.  Saw the great reviews and jumped on this.While I only gave this 2 stars - the printer has the ability to get 4 stars if they would just fix some issues with firmware/software.  Fifth star, I'll hold back a little more.- Deduct for giving what seems to be sampler ink with new printer.- Reports of printer not printing at all when one of the inks are out (e.g. cyan goes but all you want to print is gray/black and it won't let you).  Will confirm this.  There is no reason to require this.- Scanning - scanning from device is unnecessarily hard.  Have to click 3-5 buttons depending on scanning you want to do.  Canon could do this with one button.  Unnecessarily difficult.  If they would just allow you to assign a default scan to destination and allow the B&W and Color Buttons to be configured to scan or just be used as what type of scan you want it would be greatly improved.- Printer shakes a lot when printing.  Surprised by this.- Contrary to others, setup especially when configuring to do things other than print, like scan wasn't flawless.  Requiring the Epson event manager to be running is confusing.Plus side,- the print is good quality - same as Canon MX882.- I like the idea of the XL cartridges.",0,0

I regret I did not.Like most other buyers of this product over the past 1.5 years, I did not receive a ""bluRAFIA Schmidt K5"" ink converter!  I received an incompatible bait-and-switch substitute.ORDERING THIS PRODUCT IS LIKE PLAYING ROULETTE. YOU WILL LOSE ALMOST EVERY TIME ! ! ! Consider yourself a winner if you get the correct ""bluRAFIA"" labeled product delivered, even if it is a re-order from an old trusted seller.If you are lucky, as a consolation prize you may get  a generic  ""Schmidt K5"" ink converter rather than brand-name ""bluRAFIA"" version.Like most of the buyers in the past 1.5 years, I wasn't even lucky enough to get the generic ""Schmidt K5"" ink converter. At least those are made by Schmidt and are identical in every way to the brand-name ""bluRAFIA"" version except for the missing ""bluRAFIA"" label.Mine is not a clear plastic 3 inch converter that is labeled ""bluRAFIA"" on the large chrome band. It is a thinner and shorter unlabeled green converter that does not fit securely into any of the high-end vintage pens I have that require a ""Schmidt K5"" ink converter or its equivalent.The substituted green converters seem to be smaller Standard international Converters which happen to fit many modern off-brand fountain pens or those designed to use modern ""Universal"" ink cartridges. Many novice fountain pen users have been buying this Schmidt k5 product over the past 1.5 years without realizing they were shipped a smaller substitute converter. It seems they are very happy if it just happens to fit. If you see a positive review of this product praising a green converter, that buyer did not realize they did not get a Schmidt K5 converter (which is almost all positive reviews in the past 1.5 years).See the ""Comments"" section of this review if you want more details and sort them by ""Oldest"".",0,0
R23HHDP4E6E2WU,"I always looked on people who give one star as cranks, but I don't see how else I can rate this machine. I have a Brother laser printer that works fine. I am sure this one will if I ever get it set up and fixed. But it came with clogged black nozzles. Unfortunately, because of travel I wasn't able to open the box until after the 30-day return period for Amazon. That's my responsibility, but it doesn't let Brother off the hook. No black. The cleaning programs produced no improvement but did use up all the black ink. The Guide suggested trying a replacement cartridge. I went out and bought one. This improved the black performance but still left lots of gaps on the test sheet. I called Brother. Nice person in Jamaica. She initiated a deeper cleaning, which however used so much ink that I ran out of ink on all cartridges and the cleaning stopped. My local Staples doesn't carry the ink for this printer. I now have to take another trip and will not be able to continue for a couple of weeks. I have spent--in hourly rate--several times what the machine cost.

Not until a cartridge ran out of ink did I learn that you CANNOT print, even in black and white only mode, if any one of the cartridges is out of ink.  ALSO, it won't actually tell you specifically which cartridge needs replacing.  AND it keeps dropping the ink levels down lower and lower WITHOUT EVEN PRINTING ANYTHING!Had the error that can't print because (some unspecified) cartridge was empty.  Went to ink level screen, it said yellow was out., cyan low, ,black had 200 pages left.  Replaced yellow cartridge and without doing anything else went back to ink levels to see what they read.  Now cyan was OUT and black only 100 pages left! So since I can't print as long as ANY cartridge is out of ink I HAD to replace the cyan.  Replaced it and went back in to check in levels again.

He defiantly ended up with the better sharpener.  So much better that I'll likely have to buy her another one because I feel guilty that hers so junky compared to his.  Perhaps i'm being a bit harsh, but i think it's essential that the shaving door have some type mechanism for opening and closing it that prevents accidental messes. This one has non - pick it up and tilt it and the door falls off and spills your shaving all over the floor. Had to put a piece of masking tape on it as a temporary solution.  JUNK .  If i'd paid $10 then i might forgive this obvious design flaw, but given what i paid, and the fact that the Westcott cost less and is 2-3x the quality, it gets a 1 star in my book",0,0

Plug/unplug so device reboots and allow it to download.- IF YOU DON'T UPDATE YOUR FIRMWARE BEFORE signing up with Phone Power you will never be able to do so as they LOCK YOU OUT of the device that you OWN.- Calls to Phone Power support are handled by teens and twenty somethings with very little actual knowledge of the voip industry.- Rude/condescending responses to inquiries - ALWAYS BLAME YOUR ISP ( I have two connections DSL + Cable) both score extremely highly in voip tests- Phone Power test server is JUNK -  use Visualroute servers to test voipPhone quality is acceptable not great.

R24HKSEN9SWF1L,"Booo.  I was so disappointed that this cart was such a bust.  I live in a historic neighborhood, one that comes with mature tree roots wreaking havoc on the streets and sidewalks.  I made it the 1/2 mile to the grocery without issue.  I was pretty annoyed that the back wheels don't swivel, making it impossible to turn the cart when pushing it through the grocery store like a traditional shopping cart.  Because of the bad reviews I read about weight and making sure the bottom doesn't bow, I was minding my list of veggies, a few dry goods and 1 gallon of drinking water.  All was well and I headed out of the store.  No bowing, no squeaks.  Nothing to show any signs of stress.  I walked on the street for part of the way as the sidewalk is pretty non-existent because of the tree roots with makeshift ""bridges"" and I wasn't going to test it.  Once I got to a place that I could move safely onto the sidewalk I hit a small pothole and SNAP.  The entire middle plastic part of the wheel snapped right off.  There I was, standing there with my sad, broken-down old lady cart.  i had to call my husband to have him come pick me and our groceries up - which he was none to pleased with since it was football Sunday and he had regaled himself to the man-cave and determined to not wear pants for the entire day.  It was $30, so I should have known, but I'm really not happy that it didn't even make one round trip to the store.  Wouldn't recommend it.",0,0
RZPYEXQMNY6QI,"I'm not seeing too many products that fulfill this particular need, so I'm glad I bought this, and I'll continue to use it.The Good:- Feels sturdy enough- I like the size. It's nice and slim, so it fits the glove box easily.- I like how thick the card is that you can record the maintenance history on.The Bad:- Needs to be at least a half inch taller. When you fold your service receipts in half, they stick out above the folders. You'll have to keep them all the way in the back if you don't want them blocking all the tabs. You can close the top flap with them in there, but it's not completely flush, so it won't close as tightly as it would without them.- There needs to be at least one more maintenance card. They make it look like you get two cards. One with the labels on top, the other without. You don't. You just get the one with labels on it, and you tear those off. Really misleading. For older vehicles, or those of us that like to do more work than just the regular maintenance, there's not going to be enough space. My card is more than halfway full, and I'll be pretty close to finishing it after some work I'm doing this week. That sucks.Overall, this will work fine, but it's always annoying to have little issues that make it pretty obvious the person selling it doesn't even use it themselves. Playing tricks with the photos to make it look like you're getting more than you are honestly doesn't even deserve two stars.",0,0

R39K16Z3P2LEGJ,"Many people review PhonePower service and give it 5 stars soon after they get it. Believe me, I would've done the same thing just 6 months ago. But I give them 1 star and here's why. I switched to PhonePower 18 months ago and was a happy customer for a year. After that it all went downhill. I started having problems, couldn't make calls, couldn't receive calls. Called tech support, they do try to help but after a few days the service would be dead again and I would call again and someone would try to help again. One day I spent 1.5 hours on the phone with their tech guy who went through everything and couldn't tell what the problem was but after a few ""unplug, plug back in"" tries it started to work again only to die a few days later. After trying many different things and dealing with restarting the PhonePower adapter on a DAILY basis, I was convinced that it was the adapter that had gone bad and I needed to replace it. So I call tech support, complain about no service and ask for a new adapter that I could try out. Every time they refuse to do that (even though they say they could technically do it) but first they give you a ticket number, tech support calls you, asks you to restart the adapter a few times, the phone works again, problem solved, yeah, UNTIL it dies again the NEXT day. I call again and ask for a new adapter and mention that I've dealt with tech support numerous times but the problem is still there and all I want is to try out a new adapter. They say their normal procedure is to have a tech guy call you and diagnose the problem. They sound like a broken record and there seems to be no way around it. I even threatened to cancel the service and was told it's my choice to do so (of course it is but to me it sounds like they don't really care if I do). My problem is that I pre-paid 2 years of service (stupid idea but lesson learned) so the remaining 6 months would be a waste of money (I doubt they would give me my money back).So, if your service works like mine did for a year then great, but don't hold your breath, one day you might have to deal with this nonsense tech support. Wouldn't recommend PhonePower to anyone.",0,0

R1JTDCHVE0LB9M,"Review after 9 months:- Constant print alignment problems- Smearing- Skipped lines- Heavy color ink usage even though I almost never print color or pictures- Black ink runs out fast even though I use the faded-grey draft mode for more than half my printsThe quality problems are so persistent and grievous that I can't imagine using this for business.  I use it primarily to print worksheets for my two kids, and UPS return labels.  Every time I try to use it for something where quality matters, it disappoints.If this was truly low-initial-cost printer (40 dollar job), then I would accept getting what I paid for.  While this is still an inexpensive printer, the ink costs add up quickly and I will have to consider dumping this since it cannot print anything decently and is too costly to print casually.Note: The printer will not print black if I select black-only if even one color cartridge is reported empty.  I'm disappointed that the Epson is deliberately set up to stop printing black just because a color cartridge is out and did not allow a workaround to print black only. Shame.I've found the scanner produces poor image quality.  I would like to scan my children's artwork on paper, but I get better results taking a picture of it with a camera.  I suppose the scanner function works adequately if you're just using it to replace fax.Printing can be good quality if the right ""inkjet"" paper is used so it doesn't bleed too much.  I think this is the first inkjet I've had where I won't regret having it instead of a laser printer, but I also wouldn't replace the lasers at the office with anything like this.  It's definitely a home, personal or small office, low-productivity printer, and it has limited page sizes.  Personally, the thing I miss the most is double-sided 11x17, but admittedly that is another category/price-range.I have done some photo prints on this, which I would not plan to do regularly.  This is not a photo printer.  I used photo paper to print some proof-of-concepts for an offset print project.  The print quality was quite good, but the printer left roller marks with many tiny pin prick dents on the paper.  There may be an adjustment for this, but it's not worth it to me to figure out.  It was awkward enough just changing paper sizes and orientation with the poor user interface.  For photo printing, I still prefer a laser-exposure mini-lab type system (Fuji Frontier etc.) - In other words, I send it out to a service.I frequently have alignment problems with the printer.  I get places on the page where the image is shifted left or right.  I've run the print head alignment utility several times but it still has alignment problems on occasion.",0,0
R1HA3KW9398TU6,"UPDATE- (merely 2 weeks after my initial review).  Dropping to one star.  The presenter stopped working after a week and a half of use.  I changed the battery, and it was not in any way abused.  It might have just been a dud, but it seems like the old saying rings true-  you get what you pay for.As a school teacher, I go through my fair share of presenters.  Because of the seemingly short life of presenters in general (some have stopped working, one was stolen, and one ended up taking a bath in a students spilled water) I bought this cheaper version, in hopes of not blowing 30 or more dollars every other year or so on a new one.  The long and short of it is that this presenter works- it’ll get the job done when you need it to.  It’s got decent range and the laser pointer is ok (not super focused, but again gets the job done).  My biggest issue with this presenter is that there is ZERO intuitiveness in this product:  to move your presentation forward, you have to hit the down arrow.  I’ve been using this 4 times a day, 3 days a week and I’m still messing up the flow of presentations by going backwards when we need to move forwards and vice versa.  Yes, this is user error, but moving forward should be the up arrow.  One other potential flaw is how flimsy it feels.  I constantly worry that it is going to break or outright snap in half while I use it.  But, you get what you pay for, and for 12 bucks I’ve got a presenter that works and I’m happy with it overall",0,0

R1A8B5HALR35XJ,"Update to my previous 5 star review.  When I ordered the HP 92/93 cartridges I ordered two sets.  The first set worked fine and lasted a long time.  The second set which I just put in worked fine at first and then ink faded out after only about 10 pages of printing.  I put my printer thru the cartridge cleaning cycle and the amount of ink got even worse.  Useless cartridges.  Sadly it is obviously hit or miss with these and I will never be buying again.______________________________________________________________________________________________________________Previous review  - Both HP 92 and 93 cartridges work greatIt's been over 10 years since I have given remanufactured ink cartridges a shot.  They were always leaking and worked streaky at best.  So I've been buying the HP 92 and 93 dual pack to be sure they would work.  But the cartridges are very pricey and when I saw the price and reviews of the Valuetoner cartridges I decided to give them a shot.  If they didn't work out - nothing really lost due to the price.  I was totally impressed with the purchase right upon receiving them.  The cartridges are packaged individually and with great care.  They also come with detailed and clear details on the cartridges themselves, how they work and how to troubleshoot if your printer won't see them as valid cartridges.  It all went very simply for me.  My printer noted that they weren't authentic HP cartridges but accepted them right away and printed the test page the same as after every cartridge installation.  These cartridges did not leak at all upon opening and printed flawlessly upon installation.  The test page was perfect and after about 100 pages both cartridges have not streaked or faltered in quality at all.  I see some people feel some cartridges are not performing as they wish.  Honestly that has happened with authentic HP cartridges to me many times as well.  I print many photos and often with the HP cartridges they would start fading or streaking after only 10 prints and I would have to put my printer through the clean cartridges mode.  With these Valuetoner cartridges that has yet to happen.  I am more than thrilled and impressed with their quality and the professional packaging of the company.  I highly recommend giving this company and these cartridges a shot.  If my cartridges do indeed start to falter I will adjust this review accordingly to be as accurate and helpful as possible.",0,0

Unfortunately, I now think this is the norm for this product and not the exception. The cards I received were coated in some sort of white powder that I just spent 20 minutes trying to wipe away (not a great experience as my guess is that it's some sort of chemical), and even after the cleaning process many of the cards are still unusable. I really like the concept of this calendar with it's storage pockets, two-sided number cards in yellow and red, and both English and Spanish words.

It works amazing on my desk, gripping the tablet so it doesn’t shift around as I use it. The tape does NOT work hanging things on the wall. I worked to hang 16 frames (as advertised) and within the first 20 minutes one of the pictures fell. I put it back up hoping it was a fluke. In the next 20 minutes two more fell, and a full hour after that a 4th fell and shattered.Anything horizontal, it can hold well. Anything palm sized or smaller it can hold on the wall. Anything else is useless.1 star because I can’t give 0. I bought this to hang art and that didn’t happen. A gross disappointment.2 stars for removal because it is hard to tug the tape off but it doesn’t leave any residue past a small film you can wipe off. Surprising with how well the tape sticks to surfaces when you try to remove it, you’d think it could hold up a picture frame.DON’T BUY THIS unless you plan on horizontal use only",1,1
RLNXDTDKA0GS4,I bought three tagging guns. Two were Yazy Craft guns because they were cheaper. I paid extra for this Amram gun because I saw good reviews and I thought it might be my favorite of the three. After tagging 1500 products with my employees I can definitely say the Amram gun is worthless. It was worthless after tagging 10 products. Everyone hated having to use it and eventually it was just discarded to the side. The YazyCraft guns worked remarkably well every time. So if you need a tagging gun I recommend purchasing those instead.,0,0
R35M5YVTZM6134,"Wife's review on hubby's account:Please do not buy this. I hated it. The bottom piece and its gel insert both will not stay in one place, making it nearly impossible to use the way it is meant to be used. I straight up had to duct tape the bottom to the top piece very well , along with taping the gel insert in and the piece of crap still fails to serve its purpose well. Waste of money. Big mistake. If you can somehow get it to piece together securely without problems, you will notice that your wrist starts to hurt after a few days. Just avoid the nightmare.",0,0
R3IMFUC861DBPZ,"I purchased the notebook from the Basics website. The concept and the structure of the notebook are great. However, the execution of the notebook is less than excellent. While I don't intend to make a return, as I ordered internationally and the functionality of the product is somehow fine (also, I love the colour of the cover- girls will be girls!), I was hoping for a much better aesthetic experience.Let me give you a little insight into my notebooks obsession, before I jump to the feedback. As the daughter of a librarian who later got to own a school supplies store, I grew up around paper, blank and typed. I have developed a ""taste"" for paper. And granted, I have no expertise in the production and design of paper, blank or typed, I have great expertise as a consumer of notebooks. My ""must"" souvenir from whatever country I visit is the ""best notebook I can possibly find"" walking through the old neighbourhoods of Barcelona, along the charming streets of Zielona Gora, or anywhere else, really. I carry on me at all times 2-3 notebooks: one for my inner truths, one for planning my days, and a Bamboo Spark for mixing paper and digital when working. I could go on and on, but I will stop now. I was hoping this notebook would be some sort of 2 in 1 and reduce my paper load. It didn't. Bottom line, I am a notebook freak. That's where this feedback is coming from:- the sideview of the notebook looks somehow messy, not at all like a high-end notebook/planner. This is exactly how it looks out of the box, I did not put anything inside it.- the cover has small colour defects, caused by the elastic bands- the inside of the cover looks poorly glued. So much so, that just 3 days into using it, the cover is starting to fall apart.- also, the way the elastic band is glued on the inside of the cover does not look entirely professional, and because of the thin paper (to which I will get back later), it may cause ""bumpy"" handwriting on the following pages- when opening the notebook, the first page was glued to the cover in the corner, which caused an ugly breakup seconds later- the ink used for the text is not always equally distributed, the aspect is messy- the pages are rather thin, as the very thin fine-liner managed to almost imprint the other side of the page:- the back pocket came with a corner and a non-flat aspect- and last, but not least, one of the selling points is (potentially) misleading, or at least inconsistent: the description reads lined but the pictogram on the back of the box shows dotted pages. Now, dotted notebooks are my absolute favourites in the world. I was actually a bit disappointed when I didn't locate any dotted page in the notebook.Any single one of these ""faults"" would be easy to overlook, even by a notebook geek like myself, but all of them together kind of ruin the ""premium experience"". Totally not worth the 30 bucks + international shipping. Had I read the reviews before purchasing, I would have spent my money on a real notebook (yeah, it's more of a planner than a notebook).",0,0

R1243G2T5IKA85,"As the saying goes, you get what you pay for. I ordered two sets and sorry I even ordered one.There are more negatives with these pens, than positives. The pastels (WaterChalk) are completely useless. Although there appears to be ink, in the barrel, little comes out and when it does, it's very scratchy. The same holds true for the neons.The metallics and glitters flow OK, but you have to shake the ink down, to get the ink flowing and continue to shake, during use. However, don't shake too hard, since the barrel may fly out of the casing. Took me a few minutes to find the barrel on the other side of the room, the first time I used the pens.The ink also takes some time to dry, so be careful not to accidentally smear an area, you just finished working on.Another pen, the nib literally, fell out of the pen completely. No pressure, just went to use the pen and the nib, fell out. I expect, with more use, other nibs will soon follow suit. See image.I didn't expect a great pen, for the cost, but I did expect all pens to at least work. They are very poorly made, so don't expect much.I sincerely believe, those who left positive reviews (minus the 50 unverified reviews), were pressured by the seller to leave a review and left reviews, prior to using the pens, based on the case the pens are packaged in, which is the best part of the entire item. Presentation is great, but I would rather receive good pens in a plastic bag, than a fancy case, with lousy pens.I wondered why the title stated: Perfect Gift for Age 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 years old - now I know.

I thought this may have been a one-time issue, since they've been plenty sturdy and rigid up until this point. So, I ordered another batch of mailers...same thing again. When I reached out to customer service to tell them about the issue, they simply said, ""These are the same mailers as we've always had."" No effort to hear me out or to rectify the issue.

R263OUDU7RLFUC,"Garbage pens - there is more moisture in the Gobi desert than the ink of these pens.  A further insult is that I only received 8 out of 12 pens.  Oh yes, they arrived loose, unhermitically sealed in a plastic bag within a plastic bag, and not the box illustrated above.  I had initiated a return to Amazon but resigned myself to eating this loss, rather than staining my reputation with Amazon: I don't think they would believe that I had received a plastic bag of 8 pens instead of the 12 I had paid for.  Even that wouldn't be so bad if even a handful of these accursed pens actually ejected the consistent iota of ink necessary for a ballpoint pen to function/have a purpose for existence.As it is, after shaking vigorously for 20 seconds, about an inch of ink will come out before it goes dry.  These ""RT BLX"" pens were highly rated on WireCutter etc, but my personal experience has embittered me towards this entire brand, for the next 7 lifetimes.  These pens, if I haven't been sufficiently clear, are not just entirely useless, their very presence soils the sight and spoils the mood.In summary, I wish to inform the good folks at Amazon to know that they are stocking literal junk in the form of these pens.  I obviously don't recommend them, and I lost good money buying them. And if you are compelled to buy them, I strongly recommend counting the pens, and trying each one immediately after receipt, and sending them back in a timely fashion if they don't work.Thank you for your time, and I bid you a fond adieu.",0,0

RJ4U12LSC3CEY,"This review is about my experience and not a review of the planner itself as I have not been able to use it yet. I ordered direct from their website.I ordered the A5 size planner because I like to carry it with me, like a journal, pretty much how it is intended, I don't like the bulky B5's and haven't used one for that reason, which is why I was actually a PassionPlanner user for many years. So I was excited about the A5 in freedom mastery, I've been watching their company grow for years, and just waiting for the smaller planner size. What I didn't know when I purchased the A5 was that the layout was completely different than the B5. It is not very obvious in the details nor in the ""description"" which is a generic video that reviews the B5 size. So I ordered the A5 size assuming it was the same layout. NOPE, 1. all the months are in the front part of the planner, and 2. the weeks are not ""5a-10:30pm"" time slots, they are just blocks of days that are stacked, e.g. block for monday, tuesday and weds on the left page, then on the right page thurs, fri, sat, sun. there are little checkboxes on the left edge with a "" : "", I presume for entering your own time.So, I requested a return given it was unclear that the layouts weren't the same. Well I ordered the planner on 10/3/20, received it on 10/8/2020, and on 10/9/2020 I requested a return. I got an email saying they'll get back to me soon and gave a ticket for tracking progress. I kept checking the ticket and it said status: ""awaiting your reply"". So I figured they were super busy, but literally 2 weeks in I was getting impatient. So on the ticket I indicated I was still waiting to get a response. The next day, still no response, so then I thought ""awaiting your reply"", was there something I missed? Was there something I was supposed to reply to? So I wrote again, saying just that. Then I get this email, generic type ""we see you've gotten the planner, tell us how it is"" type thing, so I responded ""still waiting on a response from my first question. This is 10/23/20 by the way, they finally respond and apologize profusely, asking if I want a return they'd refund, but I'd have to pay for shipping, but if I wanted an exchange they would wave the shipping for the new item. I thought that was reasonable. So I responded around 10/26 that I was willing to try the B5 since I was still interested in the planners process. They responded that I would get a separate email with an RMA#. But there was no comment on the planner I was wanting in exchange...now 10/29, still no email with RMA#, so I wrote back again, they said I should have gotten an email from UPS, but nope, checked spam, trash, inbox, with every variation of searches for ""UPS"" ""RMA"" and the number they gave me...nothing.

I believe in honesty.  Look at the dimensions listed: 27x17x7.6.  Now that's bizarre, obviously.  It's not 7.6 inches in any dimension.  Dimensions can be critical, in my case 27"" high would not fit under my desk, but in reality it does.  That works for me.  It's top is level with my sitting down kneecap.

Also, it gets used every day, seven days a week so it never sits for long periods of time without printing. Once the heads clog, running the cleaning cycle over and over does nothing, aligning the heads does nothing, replacing the ink cartridges does nothing. I now have regularly-spaced horizontal banding and smears on the text. The first printer went 1 1/2 years before the printhead clogged. The latest one went only 3 months.

The paper feeder is incredibly flimsy.  You can not print continuously with glossy paper unless you don't mind a constant paper jam or the paper going in crooked.  When the feeder jams it rips the edge of the sheet rendering it impossible to try to get through again. Out of 100 sheets of glossy paper I've wasted 22.  This is very frustrating.  I can not recommend this product unless you want to print on regular paper or on dvd's.  Don't purchase this if you work with photographs.",0,0
R2IKNOCRU1OTU7,"Don't buy Epson!  Contrary to the Consumer Reports Reviews, this printer has been horrible.  Quality of print degrades very quickly.  Ink cartridges are super expensive given that the quality of prints are so poor.  Each cartridge one only lasts a month to two months with moderate to low use.  Overall:  Epson is scamming customers.  Stay away!",0,0

R6M6RQI092TP2,"I play CS:GO, just under 6000 hours in and still going strong. I have used many mousepads over the years. The list includes:Logitech G440Razer Goliathus Speed LargeRazer Goliathus Speed ExtendedHyperX Fury S ProHyperX GTF-XCorsair MM300 ExtendedCorsair MM600Steelseries Qck+Steelseries Qck+ LimitedFnatic Boost ControlFnatic Boost SpeedA Used Cutting Board (literally)As well as many not special or famous brand mousepadsI do not consider this a fast mouse pad. I have played with hard pads, soft pads, and hybrids. It has the worst aspects of both kinds of mousepads. The Static Friction is very high as a result of the mousepad's surface. Static Friction is the force keeping an object at rest, as in not moving. Some people prefer high friction mousepads so they can ""stop on a dime"", right when they wish the mouse to stop moving, they just stop applying force. This is not a typical high friction mousepad.The problem is that this mousepad has an odd ratio of the Static Friction to the Kinetic Friction.Kinetic Friction is the force stopping or slowing a moving object.Its difficult for me to explain precisely how one of the problems feel;When the mouse is moving in one direction, in order to then move in a different direction while moving you have to overcome the friction of the mousepad again at that angle. I assume it is because of the way the stitching is done.I haven't had this issue with other higher friction mousepads.It makes it difficult for me in games that requires non straight line movements.I switch between mousepads sometimes based on situation, or how my mouse feet are behaving. Currently my pair is the HyperX GTF-X, and the Razer Goliathus Speed Large. With the GTF-X the static friction is low, so small movements in any direction can be done with very little effort. The kinetic friction is very close to the static friction, so I can consistently make wide turns with small adjustment after. With the Goliathus Speed, the static friction is slightly higher, but the kinetic friction is lower it requires less force than the initial force to keep the mouse moving.I play a Support/2nd-3rd Entry role on my team; I recognize that entrying is easier with the Goliathus Speed, so I can do several 180° turns, and they don't have to be accurate on the small scale, since it is close range and teammates are engaging. Otherwise the GTF-X is comfortable for everything else.I cannot effortlessly use the QCK+ Limited because the static friction is higher than is comfortable, and the kinetic friction while moving is still rather high, but less sticky feeling than the static frictionThis mousepad fits neither of my roles and therefore I can not recomend it personally. Some of you may prefer the way it feels. If you play other games, the issues I stated above will likely not apply.P.S. My feeling of fast and slow may be radically different than others because I played on hard pads much of my career too. I would even mix lotion with water on a folded rag and coat the surface of the hard pad with the mixture, wiping it clean every few minutes. There was so little friction that If I put a folded peice of paper under one side, the mouse would slide off the table. I had to apply force to stop the mouse when it was moving. If I lightly tapped it on with a finger, it would slide accross until its feet dropped off the surface of the hardpad.Please consider my perspective in your evaluation of my review, and your decisions because of it.",0,0
R2XUTVLE0PGW34,"Ditto to the negative reviews.  My last 3 Ampads have been (a) 2 of 3 not printed (or not cut) straight so lines not parallel/perpendicular to edges of paper, (b) 1 of 3 roughly cut so saw marks clearly visible on pad end, (c) 1 of 3 holes not punched to fit 3-ring binder nicely, (d) 3 of 3 right margin too small for page numbers, (e) paper progressively became thinner over my last 3 pads so that my current pad pages are thinner than printer paper, (f) pages don't tear off nicely (must cut down glue on top, after using about 3 or 4-mm of paper, I used to be able to just rip the glue off the top, but try that now and the entire glue band will separate), (g) glue as just described and doesn't keep cardboard back on very well.  So these pads are not what they used to be.  On the other hand, they are much less expensive than they used to be.  I'd rather pay more for a quality product.",0,0

R1SF68ZFODN1XS,"Buyer beware. The replacement lamp I got was 3rd party and not made by Benq as advertised. I bought this several months ago when my projector told me that the lamp will need to be replaced soon. When I received it I noticed that it wasn't in the same packaging as my first replacement lamp from BenQ and it looked slightly different. I have yet to put it in my projector as my current lamp is still going strong. Going back a looking at the reviews since my purchase I see lots of people stating that it has damaged their projectors which makes me very apprehensive to install this lamp.UPDATE:My old lamp finally gave out and I gave this one a shot. Thankfully it didn't immediately pop or damage the projector as others have reported. However the color is very muted and has very low brightness. To make things worse after about 10 minutes the color will mess up causing sections to go black and white and become distorted.The seller that fulfilled my order for the bulb by BenQ (which wasn't actually by BenQ) was P-Lamps. Unfortunately it seems Amazon clumps all of the same product together regardless if they're OEM or third party. My suggestion would be to avoid P-Lamps (or any other third party) and buy directly from Amazon which, unfortunately, is not the default seller.",0,0

R2EWLTYFAWTZAI,"I hate this printer more than words can say. I spent way too much money on it, and it has CONSTANTLY malfunctioned, from the installation 7 months ago to everyday use. I tried to take it back, but after 3 months, I have to deal with the manufacturer directly.I run my own business, so I'm pretty savvy with computers and printers. I know more than the basics. Yet I am constantly on the phone with Kodak Tech Support, trying to figure out why the printer stopped working--yet again.  At best, I get a few weeks of printing without a problem. Then, once again, I'll get an error message.  Usually, uninstalling, then re-installing the software does the trick.  And their tech support is good.  But who has the time to keep calling them, and spending 30-60 minutes on the phone, while we go through their scripted problems.  WHAT A PAIN.  After it happened again today, I decided to write this review.If I could get my money back, I would.  I will NEVER buy another Kodak printer as long as I live.UPDATE 8/05/13I had customer service set me up--yet again. Told them the problem. They assured me it wouldn't happen again.I used the wireless version for several weeks, printing without a problem. Then I needed to do a scan. Uh oh.I avoided it until I couldn't any longer, then attached the USB port. Scanned. Sent to my computer. All good.  Took out the USB port and guess what? I've lost wireless connectivity.Again.And nothing that I do will restore it.  Yet again.So, for now, I'm using the damn thing with the USB port. I just can't take another call to tech support, only to have it happen all over again.Like I said. I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER KODAK PRINTER AS LONG AS I LIVE. Oh, and by the way, the ink isn't any cheaper, anyway (the whole reason I avoided an HP printer). Sheesh.",0,0
R1FW9VRSISRMIG,"Like others on this site, I was looking for that simple manual pencil sharpener from my childhood.  Sadly, this is not it.  It's not the cheap construction that bothers me.  I taped the pencil sizing disk in place to deal with that, and I un-tape it when I need to change sizes.  I also keep the entire silver bin taped as well so it doesn't fall off.  No, the maddening reason for this 1-star review is that it constantly breaks the lead while sharpening pencils.

First, I did expect a larger box, the same size as the box of bubble wrap I got from sam's club, but it was quite a bit smaller. When it came time to use it, I first noticed how thin and cheap it looked. Then quickly found out how thin and cheap it really was-- even though it is perforated, it tends to rip and shred in any spot when you pull it out if the box. Plus it's not going to do much for protecting any of our possessions because it is so fragile. I would have returned it, however we needed it right then since we are moving. We will probably end up making a last minute run to the hardware store tomorrow to find some better quality foam to reinforce.

R2NHI8C4NR8C1W,"Why oh why does this cart have so many positive reviews? This thing is grade A crap.Assembly was straightforward until I reached the casters, which should have been easy as well. Not a single one of them correctly popped into place, they’re not the exact right size for the metal legs of the cart, not to mention that one of the cart legs is slightly oval shaped instead of circular. Even with padding, I bruised my hand and got a blood blister trying to force the things in. I knew then that I should give up, disassemble, and return the product. Did I? No.Have I mentioned that thing thing is cheap? It’s VERY wibbly-wobbly with my Cricut Maker on it and I don’t expect it to last long. I’m convinced that if my cat jumps on it, the whole thing will come crashing down. I can’t store anything else even remotely weighty which essentially defeats the purpose of the shelves/drawers. It shakes a fair amount when my Cricut is in use, to the point where I worry that my design will be flawed. The casters are incredibly cheap and very small, not large enough to roll over.. well anything really: certainly not a throw rug, the tracks for my sliding closet door, or the line where my carpet changes to linoleum.

R1X69E0B67ZVTJ,Pros:- this tape would be good for low tac applications only- competitively pricedCons:- this is not a 'strong hold' as advertised. I was using it on the back of some 45mm wide PVC trim to stick it up against a PVC frame. It failed. Quite miserable (yes I had prepped both surfaces before using the tape etc). It couldn't even hold the weight of plastic which was about 3mm thick.I would not recommend this tape other than for light duties.I hope you find this review helpful.,0,0

R1JGRE2FD16674,"These other reviews were exactly right.  I installed this door stop to prevent damage to the wall. Instead, it immediately put a nasty gouge right into the new wood molding I had just installed around the door.  At first, I thought I must have installed it incorrectly.  But no, that's how this thing is supposed to work, by pressing the metal edges of the stop on the door and molding to keep the door from opening too far.  Wood molding can't stand up to that metal edge so you immediately get a major ding in the molding.  Crazy!  Do no buy unless you have a metal door and molding (although it would probably put a dent in metal molding too).",0,0

All three instances, the plastic tip at the bottom that holds the pen in seems to pop off. Not enough glue from the factory, maybe, but nonetheless...I can't recommend these pens with such a high failure rate.Giving it two stars instead of 5 because some work, and they were only $10, but that still means I paid around $5 per  pen, with an extra cartridge of ink.

R2F2FGPXICNPC5,"You can purchase more ink to fill the stamp but just be warned you will need to have that on hand if you intend to use the stamp regularly.The design worked out only took a couple of proofs.  Included pictures.I'm on the fence about recommending.. 50 stamps seems pretty suspiciously low for a vendor that also sells the ink to resupply.  However, I'm no expert so maybe 50 stamps is about the max this stamp can handle.  That will take a long time to verify.I gave roughly 3½ stars due to:1.  The 2 week time-lapse between buying / receiving coupled with the low first supply of ink.2.  Low amount of starter Ink3.  Physically the unit itself seems to be able to lock down inside the included lid to prevent ink drying but I cannot get it to lock & each time I try it wastes ink by pressing the stamp against the inside of the plastic lid.4.  Physically the top label was off center so I had to put a sticker on to show where the true front was located.5.  Wasted a lot of ink (still counted in my total) just testing it on a piece of paper until it started to actually be acceptably clear.Nothing is deal breaking on its own but it all adds up to a lower rating over other outlets.EDIT:  Refilled but doesn't work anymore.

I wouldn't even call them pastel colors so much as they are just very, very light...3. I would be willing to put up with that BUT the pens SKIP A LOT. This is  a deal breaker. I've reached a point in my pen game where skipping is unacceptable.I'm willing to imagine that the pens I received are just a bad batch.

R2FWJZXREIIXDM,"I used these with an Epson WF-7620 printer.Thus far, I am very happy with these ink cartridges. They are certainly not as rich as the Epson cartridges, and I would not use them for work where print quality is of great importance, but I am happy with them to use for general printing and scratch-work. The cost saving is tremendous. The only issue I had stemmed from attempting to use a ""fine"" quality ink setting when printing. This resulted in my printer nozzles becoming clogged. Since the printer can clean the nozzles, it merely resulted in wasted ink, but be warned.Update: I have gone through 2 of these cartridges now and my opinion still stands. These are great for scratch-work, but I have noticed they do not handle very fine lines very well. No number of print-head alignments fixes this, so I can come out with some hazy images (in my case, music staff lines). This isn't a big deal for what I do with them, but it's good to know. I have also noticed that my printer gives me false low-ink readings, however. Keep that in mind if you purchase them.Update 2: The 2nd time purchased a set of 2 of these cartridges, I was sent cartridges of a different brand, E-Z Ink. I'm not sure who owns that brand, but a customer representative told me that, when they do not have the LD branded ones in stock, they will send out others. They did vouch for the quality of the cartridges and there is still a ""lifetime warranty,"" but this is unnerving because it was not wanted I ordered. I will have to see if the E-Z Ink carts work as well as the LD ones, but it renders reviews for this product somewhat useless if a customer cannot be assured to get what they have researched via reviews. For this, I'm docking 2 stars, because I consider that an egregious issue.",0,0
R2IX9FBEYERYC,"The ink quality is ok. Very expensive and if you have one color missing, the HP 8600 will not print at all, not even in black due to their smart chip installed on the ink cartdriges.

I will be moving to a company such as Epson which realizes that gouging customers for the price of printer ink with their smart chips isn't worth it. I'm going for the new Epson Expression EcoTank cuz these babies can be easily refilled with ink which is much more affordable than actually counting the amount of pages your cartridges will do before they run out. I do a lot of printing and the amount of cartridges I've purchased already is enough to buy 10 new printers, plus the amount of empty cartridges that I've thrown away in the garbage could start another plastic landfill..!

I'm probably returning the pen and ordering another, hoping that this was just some kind of mistake and not all the purple pens have blue cartridges, the description says the ink SHOULD be purple so we'll see.

I used these cartridges for about a month without any other problems, but I went on a 10-day vacation and when I came home everything I print had white horizontal lines across it.  I cleaned/aligned the print head repeatedly, but to no avail.  I reached out to FUZOO and they said I caused the problem by allowing my printer to sit idle for a week and a half.  I guess I should have hired someone to pop in once a day and print something while I was on vacation?  I never had any problems with my old HP cartridges (except the sky-high price), and I've gone MONTHS without using them at all.After FUZOO made it clear that they didn't have any intention of fixing my problem, I bit the bullet and bought new HP cartridges.

R2FY1A6T4TZATJ,"We are not impressed at all with the poor performance of this machine or the support from Samsung regarding the issues we are experiencing.  The main ones are as follows,1) Wastes a lot of paper printing error pages that cannot be turned off when a page fails to print correctly.  The print driver is supposed to support all the way back to OS X 10.6 and it does work, some of the time.  The same driver from OS X 10.9.5 works more often but still has issues printing random PDF files and many Pages files.  When it fails, it typically starts spitting out pages with a few odd characters printed and will not cancel.  The only way to stop it is to pull the drawer out so it stops pulling paper and wait for the last sheet pulled to cycle through then shut off the machine to clear the print job.  It does not clear from the panel button that is supposed to cancel jobs and does not and it can't be stopped from the print queue in OS X after the job has been sent to the printer.  Many of the files that won't print right from Lion print just fine from Mavericks.  All of the pages that don't print correctly print perfectly on a Xerox Phaser 6180DN.  Support's solution was to uninstall the printer and reinstall it with the same driver.  The solution sometimes works but mostly not, and one shouldn't have to keep uninstalling and reinstalling their printer just to print.2) The cartridge that comes with it should print 3000 pages at 5% coverage according to the specs for it (D203S).  We have had it use 83% of the toner with 1572 pages printed according to the web utility the machine comes with.  We are not printing graphics, just pages of text at 12 to 14 point and that would have been three reams of paper but we have barely gone through two so the counter isn't even accurate.  The specs for the toner capacity is simply not accurate for the D203S cartridge and the driver can't accurately count the number of pages it actually prints , including the error pages with a dozen odd characters on one line.3) Every time the printer comes on the lights dim.  This machine draws more power than the more than five year old four color Xerox Phaser 6180DN.  To get the power saving features it claims to have you have to sacrifice toner.  We are not using the power saving features because Samsung toner costs more than the wasted electricity.  It has not flipped a breaker yet but it is really annoying to have the lights dim all the time when using the printer.I selected this printer largely on reviews here on Amazon knowing that many people also had noticed its power hungry nature but I did not read issues with its unreliability in printing from older Apple OSes.  Personally I can't recommend this printer at all or the Samsung support solution. At least their support person spoke fluent English without a difficult to understand accent - too bad their support solution doesn't consistently work.",0,0

I had bought this 2-pack set earlier to have on-hand when I ran out.  But the problem is the printer randomly says ""The cartridge is damaged.""  This happens with one, two or three of the cartridges.  I reboot the printer and it seems to work (no error) but when you try to print - there comes the error again.  I swapped out all the ink twice (I bought a 2-pack set) and the randomness of the error did not stop.

R3RMJU8FI30GIQ,"20120425 UPDATE ...-------------------I think that I should mention that the NeatReceipts uninstaller leaves a lot behind when finished.  Granted, it did say there were a few files it could not remove; however, 610 megabytes in 274 files in 53 folders is a bit much for me to have to remove manually.  If it were possible, I would now rate the developers and the writers of their software as ZERO Stars because they were extremely sloppy and totally non-professional by leaving a lot of ""rubbish"" on my computer.  They really need to be ""Neat"" and clean up their mess!Also, I did notice, reading the logs, after uninstall, that they do have TWAIN drivers though not seemingly accessible to other software.AND, the change the Neat software install performed that causes the System32 folder to be displayed at each reboot was not fixed during uninstall.  Sloppy, totally sloppy!20120423 Original ...---------------------I really had great plans for this NeatReceipts Mobile Scanner and Digital Filing System. There were many receipts from two and a half months of travel and QuickBooks was ready. There were plenty of business cards to glean contact information. My plans were dashed! I am not sure where to begin in describing what this device and its associated software did NOT do for me. It was supposed to collect information from receipts. It seldom if ever processed the receipt especially if it was long. In all but a very few instances, little or no information was extracted from the receipt - and, what was extracted was mostly incorrect or put into the wrong field.  I am certain this was because of the terrible job of scanning. I tried business cards. Not much luck with them either. The scanner did not do an adequate job of scanning to allow the software to make a reasonable attempt to collect the contact information from the business cards. Neither black-and-white nor color scans of documents faired any better. The results were the same even after the calibration process was done.Over all, the device was a disaster and proved to be an exercise in futility.I manually corrected the flawed scanned-receipts to determine if the interface to QuickBooks offered maybe a reason to retain the unit (QB has a horrid UI)and it is very expensive to put QB on additional computers.  Well, the Neat unit's software did transfer some, but not all, of the data that might be collected from a receipt.Something annoying was, after install, at boot, the system32 folder started being displayed.  At one point, it became necessary to delete the database.  I could find no information in Help or on their website.  The only solutions available was to uninstall or just delete the folder containing the DB. It sorta worked; however, there were some artifacts left behind that could not be eliminated (showed 19 receipts but there were none).If you track cookies, this unit communicates with cloud.neat.com (...) each time the software is launched (session and secure).  Their cookie ""must"" be allowed for the software to operate.  If you are into reading the license, the license seems to restrict use of the software to one and only one computer while someone at neat wrote a FAQ that says the software can, also, be put on a mobile device.I guess I would have thought that the scanner would have had a TWAIN driver but it did not and could only be used with their software (in Device Manager it appears as an imaging device).Other reviews indicate the unit worked. It was very disappointing when the one I received did not even come close to actually working. I gave some thought to getting a replacement. I decided that I had put enough time into the device. I have returned the unit to Amazon.com.",1,1

My primary complaint is that, although the specifications indicate that the interior will accommodate standard 8-1/2 x 11 letter paper, the front-to-back interior dimension is actually a bit smaller than 8-1/2 inches. Papers curl at the edges unless folded.Update - I have taken this chest out of service. I recently needed to get out some important papers for business at a local military installation. When I opened the chest, all of the papers inside felt damp and had a bad smell. This is despite having a large pouch of desiccated silica gel inside to try to lower the humidity. I don't know if this is the result of moisture getting in from outside (the chest is kept in an air-conditioned closed in the master bedroom) or if it is chemical out gassing from the plastic lining or insulation.

R3K3DRZLYQ6XKF,"I am getting discouraged in finding a quality laptop tray. This will be the second one that I am sending back. I read the reviews, and they were so mixed that I decided to give it a chance. I don't like that I would need to add my own adjustments to make it more functional e.g. adding something to the little side drawer so that it will stay closed until I want it open. If you were to tip the tray sideways even just a little for any reason, it will slide right out. Also, the little laptop bar that keeps the laptop from sliding off of the tray, is detachable, and a very weak piece of wood, so if you remove it a couple of times, I don't think it will hold up very well. In my opinion, it should have been glued in and made to be stationary for stability, whereas it wiggles when something is not propped against it and could probably be popped out with handling/storing. The tray came with a ding and scratch or two in the paint, but I think they occurred during the painting/staining process. It looks nice enough if you don't look too closely at it, and the propping portion was great and very functional. Overall though, for the price, I was worried that with the lack of quality (strong wood material) that if one of my 3 children were to knock into it accidentally, or if it fell for some reason, it just wouldn't hold up. $30 isn't expensive, but it's not inexpensive either, and I really need something with durability, but that looks nice and works in a functional way.

(And, I usually can find SOMETHING positive to note about a product).Cons:Installation was a nightmare. I originally ordered this for the desk in my office. However, once I received the astonishingly weighty tray (over sixteen pounds), I realized that I would have to drill sizable holes in one fairly expensive desk. Rather than nervously bore holes through a valuable piece of cherry, I decided to first experiment with it on a less pricey piece. And, thank goodness for that! Not only was installation a struggle (I needed an extra person to help me), but the end results was far from ergonomic. At first, I just assumed that I would have to ""get used to"" it (maybe years of ingrained, bad habits would have to be broken). Turns out, this was just painful and bizarre. No matter how I altered the product, it was just awkward. And, ""awkward"" soon translated to aches. Perhaps 3M needs to reexamine their design ... perhaps it's just a problem with me.If you were considering this on a whim, I vote that you skip it.

The falling leaf on the main picture looks lovely, but the one I received had a bright orange, cartoonish leather sticker, or something, instead of the elegant leaf stamp.  The front had fine yellow/gold glitter on it in some places, and some came off on my hands.  The 2 stars I gave it were because of the feel of the leather on the back cover (so nice and soft), and the fancy leather edging (very well done).  I wish the company could post the exact journal they were selling, as they must all be very different.  I did send it back and receive a refund, so I was only out about $10 in shipping.  Still wishing I could find one similar to the one pictured.",0,0

They don't stick to any of my cups...and when they peel off they leave a nasty sticky residue and then hair and dust stick to that and it basically ruins the cup (or I have to invest time to get that off).  They don't stay on my Klean Kanteen stainless cups for even a 3 hour day at school...either the stainless part or the plastic top.  They do stay on my Camelback for a week or so, with hand washes.

R12RWILGVFDCFT,"This is (obviously) not an OEM lamp. It had two good reviews, so I thought I would give it a shot. Unfortunately, I could see immediately out of the box that it was of inferior quality from the original lamp.The bulb was crooked in the housing.The glass on the bulb was not nearly as thick as the original bulb.The protective glass in front of the bulb was swirly, as if it were different thicknesses in different places.The wire going into the end of the actual light was caked white and pointed upwards.Despite this, I tried it anyway, being as I had no lamp. This lamp was DIMMER than the old 2100+ hour lamp I took out. It had a rainbow pattern horizontally centered on my screen. The little light it did put out was uneven. I wondered if there were something wrong with my projector, but when I put the old lamp back in, it was brighter, no rainbow and evenly dim, so definitely the bulb was defective.It's nice if you can get a good lamp for a reasonable price, but this one wasn't it for me.",0,0

RVKW1N71G2H0P,"As other reviewers have indicated, the wrist strap portion of the 7” lanyard is not large enough for a man to slip his hand through. The seller’s photo indicates the wrist strap portion of the 7” lanyard is 5” long, but the 10 that I received have varying lengths of 4 3/8” to 5”. Only one was 5”, most were 4 ½”. So, instead of having a circumference of 10” (2 X the 5” length), the circumference of most is approx. 9”.The quality of the 7” lanyards is questionable. On 3 of them, the plastic piece that covers the joint between the wrist strap and the 1 1/2” end piece easily slips off (not properly glued in place?). This plastic piece not only covers the joint, but helps prevent the joint from coming apart. Also, on one, the wrist strap material was frayed.Of the ten 17” lanyards I received, one of them is missing the detachable connector, making it useless.In this case, the overall quality probably reflects the price paid.I would not purchase again.",0,0
R3CYTIPJFYD3ZN,"Similar to many other reviewers, the printer was working great before installing these cartridges.  Immediately, it started smudging inks, jamming paper, printing binary text data garbage on top of printouts, and leaving huge ink stains.  I don't know if it's HP doing something deliberate or what, but my printer went from being fine to nearly useless immediately after installing these.  Cleaning the head made no difference.Followup: A couple months of super smudged printing later, the printer stopped working entirely and just spat out an error message when I turned it on.",0,0
RBLO77T53L1MO,I am amending my original review of these pens from what I originally wrote. These are by far the worst gel pens I've ever bought. They pen casing is cheap flimsy plastic which are easily broken while trying to remove the lids for the first time which are impossible it seems at times to pull off. The ink flows out so quickly that one pen barely lasts for one entire picture. The photo posted is to reference a pen I used once on the only picture I colored with it. I'm sorry but when I buy gel pens I should be able to color more than one picture with them. There was several pens so far that we're a one time use pen. Am requesting a refund.,0,0

RL0L5HLXQ5M16,"I really hoped these would work, given their great reviews. But I've used 5 of the 8 cartridges so far and haven't been happy at any point (I'm just printing simple documents / recipes, etc - no photos).They often don't print one color at all (ie red and yellow print, but no blue; another cartridge blue but not red, etc). Sometimes the black cartridge is working fine and the color isn't, and sometimes it's the opposite. There seems to be no rhyme or reason, and I feel like I wasted my money on this pack. It's also super frustrating when you need something printed quickly, and it ends up being a 10 minute ordeal to troubleshoot, test/replace cartridges, and reprint multiple times just to get ONE simple page.Sadly, I'll probably go back to the overpriced Canon brand just so I don't have the frustration.",0,0

R2F2Q8VDPU6XKY,"The good - the ink print colors brilliantly and unlike other generic brands they don't come up short with colors (another brand only prints magenta and purples - no greens or blacks - was a complete waste of money) - these work.The bad - number of prints per cartridge are very inconsistent - my first cartridge generated 45 4x6 prints - after that one another crapped out at 16 prints - and the next at 22 prints - and after that 12 prints (at least with an original Canon cartridge I'm guaranteed at least 65 prints) - in short I blew through 6 cartridges that one Canon cartridge would produce.Update - I'm downgrading this to one star - the print count for 4x6 prints is very low - the four pack of CLI-36 prints an equivalent of one Canon cartridge - so is it worth buying these? Very disappointed with these. The only redeeming factor is the color is faithful compared those awful Lime Ink cartridges that only print in magenta, purple and yellow (funny - their brand is called Lime Ink but doesn't print any greens)",0,0

R2T7RQFWKCTX7F,Before you try and save money buying third party ink do some research on reviews through YouTube.  Sadly I did not do this before buying third party ink.  The common theme from people who print professionally are that these inks will kill your printer.  Which is what happened to me.  I've emailed the company a twice to just try and get a new ink cartridge or a refund.  Today I found out that my printer is dead and the third party cartridge is most likely the culprit.Use at your own risk.  If you have a newer printer I would absolutely not try using it; it will void your warranty as well.,0,0
R2N982Z3GPRHRN,"Works only when it feels like it. I've had this for less than a year and use it a couple times a month for my budget. I have to constantly unplug the USB cable for the scanner to work and all too frequently the software says Neat Software is not responding and will have to close. This had the potential to be an excellent product but because it only works some of the time with frequent restarts is why I'm giving it a negative review. I paid over $100 for this and in my opinion, it's only worth about $40. I can get the same result using a custom built database that's easy to design and my personal all-in-one printer scanner. I'm sorry I took the short cut this time.",0,0

R22JIQZFET2J1S,"Not impressed! This whiteboard seemed like it would be perfect for the job, so I had high hopes when I ordered it.  Unfortunately, it came with small dings and dents in several areas.  I was able to get beyond that because I was eager to get it hung and use in my office and they were relatively small spots.  Once hung, I was super unimpressed with the marker tray - it attaches with double sided tape!! So far, its sagged and fell twice!The part that really bothers me the most, is that the SINGLE marker it came with was completely dried out.  When I went to use a typical Expo marker, the ink bubbled up as if it were not compatible with the board surface.  I tried a different brand and it won't erase! I should have sent it back - it's a process through my department to requisition items and then to return, so I was just trying to let it go but, man this board sucks.So to sum up:- came dented- only one marker included- marker was bone dry, therefore not functional- other markers won't work or won't erase (see pics)- marker tray comes unattached due to cheap designI would have gave 0 stars if possible!!",1,1

First, the battery case is very tight, making it difficult to place batteries in and nearly impossible to get them out again.- Once I put in (brand new) batteries, and plugged in the light, nothing happened!

If you must work on your device, do it at at HOME or at the OFFICE, and NOT in the car. I am POSITIVE people are thinking they can multitask and work on their device or eat while they are driving. This is what this stupid thing is promoting and I do NOT LIKE IT. If a person is THAT addicted to their device and needs it in their face while driving, that person needs serious, professional help. I do not give a flying rat's behind if a person is stopped at a light or whatever. STAY OFF THE DEVICE until you get home or to the office or to a place where one is NOT on the road.

I had to super glue the battery compartment back in place, second off within the first 20 minutes of playing with the light I broke one of the clips.  Third its not adjustable at all so even though it just barely fits underneath my legs in bed, it doesn't leave much for switching positions and you feel pretty much like its glued onto you and you can't move.  Fourth the laptop sits to the left which is really kind of annoying and makes it very uncomfortable for long durations of typing.  Fifth it is very poorly designed, no metal, just VERY cheap plastic, with sharp edges, etc.The mouse pad is the best feature of the entire thing, another reason I chose this over others, but if you are sitting in bed or on the couch you tend to sit at an angle and the mouse will slide right off the thing if you let go of it for say two handed typing.  So it just makes for an awkward experience overall.  It is functional I guess, I could have made the same thing with four legs and a plank of wood though...

R2P845Y5PGBFPF,"Save your money -- this safe failed in within a few months of purchase. Like others on Amazon have mentioned, the locks failed for no apparent reason. I'm glad the lock mechanism failed when the safe was in an open position so I could retrieve the items I had stored, but there's really no excuse for putting such a shoddy product on the market.I rarely write reviews, but this safe has earned its single star rating. Seriously, don't even think about placing your valuables in one of these safes. If it can't stand up to being opened once a month, I can't imagine it would actually hold up during a fire or flood. Also, when the safe fails, making contact with customer service will be a pain since Honeywell doesn't provide customer service for these items and has a third party in charge of replacements.",0,0

RKL2XUQEH4TF4,"My rating was lowered from four stars to two stars after I had to add update number 2.  Definitely pass on this one.This is a large unit.  I use it in an elementary classroom.  The sharpener dials to fit six different pencil sizes which is very convenient for the classroom.  It has an adequate shaving recepticle and is easily emptied.  (I also use the  Stanley Bostitch QuietSharp Executive in the classroom. That unit is more quiet than this one is and it is smaller. It does not handle varied sizes and that recepticle is quite small.)  The Swingline unit is very easy for the children to use and we do not have problems with jamming--I stopped using electric sharpeners in the classroom for several years because of jamming.  The swingline sharpens pencils smoothly as well.UPDATE #1:After using this a bit longer in the classroom I feel the need to update the review. The sharpener jams up and stops working. Sometimes leaving it idle for a short time is enough and we can then sharpen a few pencils but other times we go for days with it not working. Although this is in a classroom it does not get heavy use as we have more than shaprener in the room. It seems that the sensor for activating the sharpener is really faulty.UPDATE #2: this sharpener tends to implement the safety that prevents it from ""overheating"" a bit too readily.  After two pencils being sharpened, it often shuts down.  Although it has various openings, it also is a bit ""touchy"" about how the pencil is inserted.  My original rating is 4 stars but I think I would have to reduce that to 3 stars.  I find my cheaper units to be more reliable.A custodian knocked the unit onto the floor and the black plastic around the opening cracked. If the plastic is held just right it will partially sharpen still.  I think it is disappointing that the motor is OK but a crack in the housing prevents us from still using this unit.",0,0

R1SKI7AXG5BFCY,"Two minutes ago the plastic channels that were supposed to hold the plastic + poster + backing sandwich together let go. Three channels, the plastic, and the poster fell to the hardwood floor -- the corner of the plastic shattered and the poster was folded under and creased. This is a poor design badly implemented because the channels were loose from the beginning and the plastic was too thin. With nothing but friction to hold the channels in place I should have known that failure was inevitable. Thicker plastic or tighter channels or thicker backing or some sort of ridge on the backing for the channels to grip might have salvaged the design but now it is too late. How does one return something like this? Will they replace my poster? I would have given zero stars in the rating had that been possible.",1,1

R3Q9M8LIK8EW6N,"I wanted to like these, but...I bought a 2-pack of the Linkyo HP-compatible toner cartridges for my HP2035 laser printer. Good price, good reviews, I thought. The first one worked rather well and seemed to yield the promised 2,300 pages. The second one, however, immediately put a series of dark gray blotches along the right margin of the page, 7 in all, each about 3/4"" wide. The more pages I printed, the worse they got, clearly a defect in the remanufacturing process. (I'm a retired quality assurance manager. A 50% defect rate in a random sample of 2 items is not a good sign. It could be that I just happened to get the random defect, but... In normal sampling inspection, 1 defect in a random sample of 2 would usually cause the entire lot to be rejected, depending on the specified Acceptable Quality Level, or AQL.)The bottom line is that I can't use toner cartridges that leave blotches. Period. Linkyo's price advantage pretty much vanished when cartridge #2 failed the minute it was installed. I have never had a problem with genuine HP cartridges and I don't consume them so quickly that the cost per year is an obstacle.As I said, the first one of the two was just fine. Hopefully, you'll get the ""good one"". I just can't recommend them based on my experience.",0,0

On top of that, because of how difficult the slot is to unseal, my index finger is all cut up and index finger and thumb nails are destroyed now. (Word of advice, put bandaids on your fingers before assembling as a method of protection). The other negative part of this experience was when I realized some of the metal clips are missing or broken/unusable so make sure you order an excess of the number of tags you need in case your clips are missing or broken too.

This reduction is because my coworker ordered two more of these for our office.  I sent her the direct link.  We were sent two of the ""other"" kind, with a plastic axle and flimsier design.  I brought this to the seller's attention, and their response was ""those aren't made anymore.""This is not ""Heavy Duty""  This is light duty at best.",0,0

RBUJ7XIZH1SKS,"Looks pretty, but beware of the spiral-binding - I immediately noticed that it ""sticks"" every time I try to open or close the cover.  The pages turn just fine, but the cover - which is a very nice soft suede-like material, is thick but flexible enough that it will kind of grab the spiral rings if you are not careful.  It sounds like nothing, because of course you can work around it, but it is super-annoying if you don't want to keep it open all day.Another problem with the spiral binding, IF you keep it open all the way, is that it sticks up pretty high, and if you are right-handed it will get in the way of you writing on anything close to the middle of the page (in this case Tuesdays and Saturdays).  I imagine that for southpaws this problem won't rear its head until around March.Maybe the design is meant to be used so that the cover is folded open back on itself?  Sounds good, but it sticks that way, too, and when you have it open to one page you don't get to see the whole week, as the left page has Mon, Tues, Fri, and Sat, and the right page has Wed, THurs, Sun, and Notes.  As such, you can't get a full picture of the week without keeping it wide open.A huge missing feature is some sort of built-in bookmark, or other way of easily going to the current week/day.  It needs a ribbon, or some sort of tear-off corner perforation.  Otherwise, you have to search for it using the monthly tabs, but every moth is at least 5 pages and it seems like extra work.Major holidays are listed in the back and printed on the dates, but right off the bat I noticed they left off nationally observed holidays. - notably Friday July 3rd, when offices are closed for the long weekend.  I don't know what other ones are missing, but it doesn't give me confidence that this planner will give me a heads-up when I need one.Just now, when I went to take a last look at the cover of the book for this review, it stuck on the spiral rings four or five times before i could actually close the book!  Ugh - I guess I'm glad I got it for free, but I think I'm still in the market for a new desk planner.",0,0

R19RHQABMZYRVH,"At first, these seemed like a huge upgrade - they rolled easier and were quieter and I felt they were much safer on my wood floors.  Of note though, these are taller than your average wheel, so if you are on the shorter side, you may not be able to get your chair low enough after installing these.  I'm pretty tall so it wasn't really an issue - and I have a height adjustable desk, so I was able to easily adjust everything to fit.The reason for the review is I have had these for 19 months - and a few weeks ago, I started noticing grease on my carpet and getting on my socks (I work from home, no shoes) then I started finding little ball bearings on the carpet.

WF-5690 received great Consumer Reports reviews.My issue (see attachments) - fine but noticeable yellow horizontal banding. This does NOT occur on my old OfficeJet Pro 8500 a909a. This is using the highest print quality possible on both (""Quality"" on WF-5690 using Mac print settings or farthest to the right on Other... using Windows settings; High Speed Printing turned off).Steps that I have tried to remedy:1. Upgrade to latest firmware GC07G4 29.DE2. Perform Print Head Alignment multiple times both from Mac and Windows computers (both for Photo and Text printing), as well as from the printer LCD control panel3. The Improve Horizontal Streaks feature in the Maintenance section of the LCD panel, which seemed to have no effect despite changing to the minimal (-10) and maximal (+10) settings4.

RJ4GXXHNJN4LM,"Well, what can I say, it's the first bad review I've given for a 3M product.The rolls of tape inside these are 300 inches, which means they are much less than the standard 450 inches.On top of that, they are not so simple to use.  One has to pull out the white tab, to which the tape is stuck, then pull the tape free from the tab.  After that, it's pull and tear as before.Before you fold the white tab back in to close the dispenser, you have to make sure the tape is tucked down against the tab, or it could fold stick-side in, which is no good.All in all, a poor design.  perhaps they can redesign it so one doesn't have to mess with a tab, or ensure that the tape is tucked a certain way upon closing, but until then, I'll be sticking with the standard dispenser.Keep in mind, the tape (apart from being shorter than normal) is just fine.

I may as well have bought a $40-60, or used my computer.I am in a hard statistics class, and an equally difficult engineering class. One day I had discovered that I had lost the TI-92 I had bought years ago in high-school. I loved my TI-92 and it had proven useful well into college. I bought this because I had thought it was the most advanced calculator that TI had offered, and I had a test that day and NEEDED something to use to check my math. I expected it to have all of the functionality of my TI-92 at the very minimum.I was happy to discover that I no longer needed to use the TI-92's unnatural grammar to perform integrals, and sigma additions. (With all of the , separating clauses) Then I attempted to do a definite intigral between two numbers, and hit enter.""Unsupported on this calculator. Buy TI-nspire CAS""I cussed, then I flipped through the options, and chose indefinite intigral, figuring I could calculate it myself.""Unsupported on this calculator""I threw the calculator down on my desk with enough force to draw the attention of the TA who was giving the test. Honestly, the durability of the thing surprised me, it did not break.After a quick explanation as to the source of my behavior, the TA decided, fortunately, NOT to throw me out of the test. I continued the test, solving the integrals by hand, unlike any other student in the test, who were all equipped with the 'class recommended' TI-89. I ran out of time with a third of the questions unsolved.I'd return it, but the box is opened, and I don't have the receipt.Thanks TI! Thanks to you I only scored 61.2% on a test that I could have probably gotten about 90% on had I had a proper calculator that could do everything your more primitive models could do!

As I'm currently taking a math course I decided to splurge on the rotring 800 (silver) because the previous rotring pros were so comfortable to use even for long periods of time (I also explicitly tell my youngest that she's not to draw using THIS one). I have purchased two of rotring 800s, the first arrived last week Monday, and the second pencil arrived yesterday afternoon. Within days of receiving the first I noticed I was constantly having to screw the components of the pencil back together, and by Thursday the feeder mechanism stopped working.

The replacement arrived Sunday 27 Sep, and instead of working on my math homework this morning, I'm writing this review, because within minutes of starting my work, the pencil came and kept coming undone. I was tempted to put loctite on the threads, but I didn't think the seller would accept a return if I did. I shouldn't have to use loctite to keep my pencil from falling apart in my hand. I feel like a Scooby-doo villain chasing Scoob and the gang through multiple doors in a haunted mansion.

R44SGSVUM4HEJ,"Updating this just to say that the software is getting worse not better.  It is possible that I expect too much.  Like the ability to scanreceipts, and use the data to do taxes, export into PDF's for expense reports for work etc.  If this is the flag ship receipt processorthan this bar isn't just laying on the ground it was compressed flat.  Now the software won't even export information correctly or itcompletely crashes the software at random time.  At some point you have to cut the cord.  Time to cut mine.  Has to be better as therecertainly can't be worse.------------ Old Review ---------------Scanner is typically functional.  Under the versions prior to 4 it was actually quite reliable.  This new software is a special kind of awful.  There was once a day when I would tout the Neat software to anyone who would listen.  If you traveled for a living.  I talked to you about how great it was.  Sadly those days are past.  This software is now terrible. I wouldn't recommend someone I hated use it.  But as all things American these days it looks darn good doing nothing well.  The latest I got back from support is the reason I can't export files is because Mozy is on????  What???  So a software I can't turn off due to the fact that it is controlled by our network admins has to be off in order for Neat 5.7 to save a file.  Insane,  If I turn the sync on it collapses the program but I can only get support for the software if I get the monthly subscription so I did.  After about 30 seconds of being on I get the ever helpful Neat has stopped working.  Which I saw twice in the previous 8 years of using the software but now see EVERY SINGLE TIME I launch the program.  My receipt processing time has tripled using this software.  They managed to turn a great software into a pile of rubbish.  One wouldn't think this is an easy feat.  I stand corrected.",0,0

R1YU5S3GLJWN6A,"Operating System:Windows 10 HomeCons:Has to use a USB 2.0 (no USB 3.0 allowed or it won't work at all). It wouldn't even work using the front I/O USB 2.0 Ports on my desktop. Had to be connected directly to the back motherboard I/O panel in a 2.0 port. Funny thing is that the preview window will start showing the document you're scanning and then it will just disappear and throw out a ""Hardware Not Found"" error.Be prepared to restart your computer at least once. Plug it in? Have to restart with it plugged in before it will work (Hardware Not Found error). Calibrate it using their sheet? Have to restart... Still throws out the Hardware Not Found error every now and then but usually can just try again and it works (with single sheets at least).So far I've only had success using their cable and since I have to plug it in at the back of the tower it makes it a bit tricky. Now that I know I have to restart the computer every time I plug it in it may work with a different micro USB cable but I haven't tested to be sure.Pros:Gave it 2 stars because eventually after 20+ minutes on hold with tech support I did manage to figure it out and get it to work before tech support even picked up (hint - restart your computer). Scans didn't come out bad but getting the entire sheet to scan is a bit tricky and has to be lined up just right or you may cut off an edge.Overall:Simply do not buy this. Stick to a reputable brand like Brother or Samsung (among others). They will cost more, as this thing is dirt cheap, but it will save you the nightmare that this thing is.",0,0

R33MN3NMHW5NFS,"I have used fountain pens exclusively since 1957, when I was a seventh-grade student. I bought this Parker 5th Generation pen in all good faith that I was getting something new. What a rip-off. Total rip-off. Do not buy this, under any circumstances. Ink cartridges for this pen cost me $8 apiece. On April 27th I installed a new ink cartridge in this pen. This cartridge cost me $8. Since that date, I signed exactly 30 computer-printed checks and endorsed 10 of them since they were payable to me. I was unable to sign my 31st check since this $8 ink cartridge was dry. As for me, I will go back to using one of my traditional ink pens. Once all of my remaining horribly expensive ink cartridges are gone, I will throw my $190 Parker pen into the garbage and charge this up to having endured a terrible experience. Sadly, this might well not happened for several months since I have nine of these ink cartridges on hand which I bought for a total of $72 not including those other cartridges which went dry. Incidentally, I have seen those infamous ink cartridges offered for sale at Amazon.com for as much as $10 each. If Amazon.com had allowed me to award this pen a total of zero stars, that's exactly what it is worth. I should mention that my signature contains seven letters and my endorsement (including all letters and my first name) contains 11 characters. Seems to me that eight dollars is a mighty high price to pay for putting 330 cursive letters on a computer-generated expense check.",1,1

R3JRTIGJLT0RUL,What a waste of money for a product - I would give product rating a -5!  I recently ordered SP4185 screen protector for my new Blackberry Curve.  I attempted to put two screen protectors on and had the same problem.  The second tab (number 2) will not come off after being applied.  Both left extreme amounts of glue residue on screen protector and could not be removed - even tried alcohol.  Only way to remove was to remove entire tab to use liquid but then obviously that made adhesive inoperative for Blackberry.  Apparently glue was old and had `set up'.In addition - form did not exactly fit the screen of the Curve and left overhang after aligning perfectly at bottom.  It is so discouraging that products like this exist in the marketplace - apparently no one takes the time to check validity of the product after being imported from Japan - there is the problem.,1,1

Because I use my color printer so seldom, I bought my back-up cartridges in July 2018, and just today needed to use one.  The back-up cartridges are in a HP951 box with the wording ""3 HP Original Ink Cartridges"".  I could not figure out why they did not work, so looked through other reviews where I learned that cartridges are made for different countries. My new box is labeled ""z10 For use only in U.S. and Canada"".  Again, should be no problem - I live in the US, bought the printer BRAND NEW in the US.  So I look at the old, empty ink cartridge and it says ""z20 For use in Europe, Russia, CIS, Middle East and Africa""!!  I look at the Black cartridge that does not need replacing and there is NO country code on the cartridge.  Now I am stuck with an expensive 951 Combo Pack with no way to return them.  In clicking on the item today, there is nothing in the picture or description indicating the country code if I ""bought it again"".

RE70G7J2HCCKF,"This is a product that is intended to hold one's laptop, something that costs hundreds of dollars, sometimes even more than that. And for 32 dollars, what do you get? Screws that are not only so small that you know they'd break if you so much as squished them in your fingers, but so small that even the machine making the holes in the legs couldn't actually do it. Only one of the holes was actually finished, meaning only one of these already pathetic screws was able to be put in.On top of that, we have the legs themselves, which are supposed to ""click"" into place according to the instructions. Instead, as you can see, they don't even fully slide into the hole, let alone make a click to lock in place. On the topic of the legs, the button system is beyond abhorrent, and you will be entirely unable to adjust this with ease, even without a laptop on it. There's also the problem of stability for even a medium-weight laptop. I tried out all the recommended positions for it, and only one worked, which involved me sticking two of the three adjustable legs straight out.I cannot even fathom how people gave this such great reviews, because a 10 dollar product I bought to compare this to works infinitely better.

If you are just sending a piece a paper it might work for you, but unfortunately not everyone buying envelops just for that.

NO LONGER.  I have a backup file for almost every day for the last year -- 300+ GB of backup files.I can only read one of the files from last April.Now, what to do for tax season?

It's a nice toy, but if you're doing real business, keep your paper just in case, and export from the Neat company program often (generate the reports and file them every month).I actually feel bad for the sales and support folks there - they tried to help me, but the program itself is not up to the quality of the other parts of the company, from what I can see.  Yes, we went around the block twice with the paid customer support call, with them remoting into my computer to see for themselves, only to tell me 2 hours later ""there's nothing we can do"" - valiant attempt, but no result.If you are tempted to buy, I'd STRONGLY recommend you read the other reviews.

I was given this product at work because it was an inexpensive solution to a tiered file folder holder. DO NOT GET THIS. Standard sized folders just barely fit on the legs, so while you're working the slightest knock, of the folders, either while doing work or while grabbing a different folder out, tend to send multiple folder's corners dropping between the legs, leaving a very messy looking setup.  Trying to fix the fallen folders tends to knock more off. It causes more time then i'd like to admit fixing and refixing the folders.  I end up feeling like those bumbling idiot characters from over-acted infomercials- ""does this happen to you??"".Eventually I just purchased a higher quality and much more expensive version on my own and have been extremely happy ever since.

What I liked the most was the white eraser. It works SO WELL, didnt rip even my thinnest papers, and cleanly erased without leaving smears or stains. If I had bought this for the eraser it would have been four maybe even five stars simply because of how nice the eraser really is. But the fact the the majority of what I used frequently doesnt work much for needs makes this a 2 star item.",0,0
R14RB32NQ2G6I8,"I bought a HP 10A laser cartridge from one of the Amazon marketplace sellers that shipped via Amazon prime.What I got was a cartridge that produced printouts with blotches and horizontal lines all over the page.  A closer examination of the box showed that it had a date code from 2007, a hologram style that is several versions old, and a color scheme that does not match the picture in the Amazon listing.  Yeah this cartridge was unused and in a sealed box, but selling a nearly 6-year old cartridge as ""New""?  That is a bit much.  You can read on the HP web site that the shelf life is 2.5 years for unopened cartridges, and 6 months for cartridges that are open.This has been a monumental waste of time.  Now I am stuck with $100+ being held hostage while my expired and defective 10A cartridge is being returned.So please learn from my mistakes.  Here is some advice:1) Beware sellers that have disclaimers that their product has a different color scheme than the listing.2) Be sure to check the date code on the box when you receive your order.3) Visit the HP web site devote to cartridge piracy - you can find full descriptions of the HP holographic seals (and you might find out that your cartridge was not intended to be sold in the country you bought it in)4) Note that even sellers that ship from Amazon via Amazon Prime can be selling you out of date garbage.Say, maybe paying $150 at your local office supply store for a HP 10A does not sound so bad after all.  You can see the box, read the date, and there is a good chance your cartridge will work as expected.Good luck with your purchases.Update 9-21-2013I purchased a second HP 10A cartridge from Amazon after returning my first one.  This time I selected a vendor that had an incredible five-star 100% positive rating for several thousand sales.  I paid more money thinking I might actually get the cartridge that was pictured in the product description.  I was wrong.What I got was another expired HP 10A cartridge with old-style packaging.  This time the cartridge was from 2011 - a whopping 3+ years newer than my original purchase, but still expired by the HP 2.5 year standard.The 2011 cartridge seems to work well enough to keep - I do not want to repeat the hassle of a return like the first one.  Still, I think it is unfair for vendors to sell known expired items as ""New"".All I want to do is buy the item that is pictured at a decent Amazon price.  I know I can go to my local office supply store and buy the exact item depicted in the Amazon listing.  The box will match, the cartridge will be manufactured in 2013, and there will be no installation or return headaches.I have uploaded several photos that show what the old-style boxes, date codes, and holographic seals look like.  If you receive an expired laser cartridge I recommend you give the vendor negative feedback regardless of whether the cartridge works in your printer. These things should not be sold as ""New"".Update 3-11-2015Here I am again 18 months later repeating history with yet another wildly expired HP 10A cartridge I bought on Amazon.  The cartridge I purchased in 9/2013 is about kaput after printing only 4700 pages.  At this point, there is no doubt in my mind that years-expired cartridges do not perform nearly as well as new ones.So like a dummy I bought yet another HP 10 cartridge from one of the marketplace vendors with a good rating that was fulfilled by amazon.  This time I got a cartridge with a manufacture date code of April 2005 – nearly 10 years old!  It is absolutely ridiculous that this cartridge was sold as new on Amazon.  I refuse to load it into my printer for fear it will hurt the mechanism.Here I am stuck shipping the thing back for a refund.  That $150 new cartridge from my big box office supply store is looking better and better.  I would gladly buy a new one from Amazon, but apparently that is not possible.Good luck with your purchases.",0,0

R3DH091MG44EN7,"If the box wasn't so heavy, such that returning it would be simpler, I would return this item.  It was shipped with the lock locked before the lid was closed, so the lid was sitting on the lock bar, which bent it so I could not unlock it (the keys and instruction booklet are taped to the outer packing material, so I don't see why this was done).  Once I bent the lock bar a bit, I could open the lock, but the bar disappeared within the cheap lock housing and would not come out.  On top of this, the lock / key is very very cheap, and I could barely get the key in the lock (one key will go in, the other won't). To top it off, the lid is very heavy, and there is no usable molded lip to lift or let it down w/o smashing your fingers.  With a few design changes this would be a great box.For me, the unique must-have features about this were the 1hr rating and its ""legal paper"" size.  And that's why I'm going to keep it.  If all you need is a box for regular letter sized paper, avoid this and related models.",0,0
R2GOP8L2EGXP6U,"Unfortunately, as  we are still on lockdown,  I can’t go to the shops and buy one in person for... half the price! I can’t believe I paid £14.99 (at time of review) for this.Why I am not sending it back? Because I can’t stand the mess on my desk any longer, so, I’ll use it. But believe me, if there had been no lockdown, I would have sent it back as soon as I opened it and would have headed to the nearest pound shop.First of all, it is small, though my mistake, I relied on the seller’s pictures and the pictures in the reviews instead of checking the measurements.Second, it is cheaply made. The little square drawer catches and is stiff to open and the finish is not very well done.  Also, it can’t even hold a business card.Thirdly, unless you have a carton back up on your A4 and put it upright, loose sheet of A4 just collapse. See my picture. Of course, I could have cleverly put a ruler in front of the papers...Lastly, it is not that sturdy. Easy to bend. It is not even pretty in real life. Just white mesh.My advice is that if you can wait, go to any home stores, market or pound shops and buy the same thing  for maybe a fiver or less.Believe me, If you saw this in a store for £14.99, you wouldn’t buy it.How did this get so many glowing reviews?Granted, it is useful but it is not that special and the fact remains that it is a cheap item. We have the right to expect quality for £15. So, a total rip off.I know that one star is a bit harsh. If the item had been priced up to £5.99 , I might have rated it 2 or 3 stars.

R17M2TE9IKR6D1,"I went ahead and purchased this product despite the poor reviews. I figured how bad could the assembly and quality of a simple cart be? I was in for a surprise!Because the parts are not well-made with poor alignment, assembly is much more difficult than it should be. If you get past this hurdle, you will discover that the cart is flimsy and of low quality. After a few uses, a holding rod slipped out, causing the cart to lose its form. In the end, I threw this product away.I don't write many reviews, but I feel I have the obligation to prevent other people from making the mistake I did. Good luck!",0,0
R1H1CP0O9MY5Q5,"Long term user of NeatReceipts (then NeatWorks, now just Neat).  Have endured through all the upgrades from Version 1.something, some easy, some not.  Have always found the interface very poor, non-intuitive, restrictive, and just plain painful to use.  Always been a bit nervous about the included corrupted database repair tool.  What is that warning me about?  But N/R could scan directly to PDF when nobody else could, so we have stuck with it.  Have awaited the promised Version 5 upgrade for more than 2 1/2 years.  If you check for updates from Version 4.9.+.+, it declares no updates available.  At the time of this writing, you have to find the upgrade to Version 5 under Downloads on the Neat website yourself.  Then the fun begins.You must ""purchase"" the free upgrade for $0.00 through multiple screens/pages.  Then it is off to your e-mail account to wait for the download link.  But, wait, what arrives is not a link; it is just the acknowledgment that you have purchased the free upgrade, and instructions to wait more for a future e-mail that will tell you how to proceed.  Oh, and if it never comes, please e-mail Customer Service.  Eventually the e-mail with the link arrives.  But wait!  Link is not a link direct to a download - link is to screens where first you must type more info into more little boxes on more screens.  Hey! Aren't we here because we are already a registered purchaser of an eligible previous version?  Lots of keyboarding and mouse moving and mouse clicks, and we eventually get to a real download link - a 132MB download. Fortunately, we have truly fast internet, so not too long a wait.  Except!...the download never completes.  The old let's get to 99%, hang there forever, then stop responding trick.  Alright, cancel this download and start again.Okay, the second download attempt succeeds.  We are now 52 minutes into something that should have taken 1 minute and 52 seconds.  We find the downloaded .exe file and start the actual upgrade.  But the install app first launches a conversion of your previous databases to the ""new"" format.  Yikes! we do have back-ups, don't we?  Oh well, at last begins the actual program install.  Lengthy install with lots of non-movement on the progress scroll bar - includes an un-install of the previous version.  Remember, it is 132MB  before unpacking, so have patience.  Sure hope this works - since our databases have already been ""upgraded"".  No going back now.  It does eventually finish.  Hooray!  We hope.Click the desktop icon and let's see what's new.  Wait, wait, wait.  Hard drive is running, something is happening.  Like the versions before it, this one seems to need some considerable time to gather itself together before making a screen presence.  Okay, we have been here before; we'll wait.  Ahhh, here's the opening screen now.....well, uhh, no, not actually.  It's a REGISTRATION screen!!??  A registration screen where we must chose the registration key we will use for this installation from a (non-functioning) drop down box that lists only the registration key that we have already typed in twice before.  Plus we are required to 'name' this computer and name its 'location' - okay, let's try 'Bob's Desktop' on 'Bob's Computer'.  That seems to work.  Now we click on the hugely over-sized Registration button and we are done.  Right?  Yeah, no, what?  Nothing. Yeah, nothing.  No Internet activity, no flashing modem lights, no nothing.  Click, click, click, clickity click, click, click.  Yep, nothing!  And this is taking place in a small FIXED size box in the middle of a 24"" widescreen monitor.  You can't re-size the registration box - it is fixed in size and it is too small for its own contents, so you have to scroll up and down and left and right inside the box, and it is apparent there is more to the underlying screen, but you can't get to it.  Great coding, NEAT guys. Is this the new interface you have been trumpeting?Okay, try to close the little box - can't; dialog box presents itself to scold me for not completing the registration.  Override the objection and close out anyway.  Re-boot the computer. Click on the NEAT icon and wait for the program to open.  But, instead...a REGISTRATION screen!  Now it shows that Bob's Desktop located on Bob's Computer has been registered with the original registration key, but before you can proceed, you must name and place and register this very same computer (Bob's Computer) using the very same registration key from the very same non-functioning drop-down box as before.  And, of course, clicking on the huge Registration button (suspect something is really amiss here!) produces the same nothingness as before.  Are we relishing and reveling in NEAT productivity yet?Ring! Ring! Ring! Hello, NEAT Support?  What? Oh, HAL the NEAT computer is saying their working hours aren't the same as mine.  I should call back when it is convenient for them.  Or stay on the line if I would like to hear them say that again.  Endlessly.So, here I sit after 396MB of downloads, two obviously failed installations, multiple registration attempts, growing angst about converted databases I can't access, one dead-end tech support call, and a missed dinner.  It is now dark outside.  I started this ultimately pointless exercise in broad daylight.  I am slowly understanding that NEAT software did indeed take me to a previously unattained level of productivity as promised.  I can't recall such a frustration-filled absolutely zero-productivity day before.  My failed installation aside, NEAT's hugely overly complicated repetitively multi-stepped upgrade process alone should warn you away.Follow-up:  Finally succeeded in completing an installation on a Win 7 laptop over an existing version 4.7.  Discovered that many of the earlier version's unique and useful features have been dropped.  Forward in complexity; backward in usefulness and features.  Still, I conducted another WIN XP SP3 Desktop installation attempt.  Started with a complete un-install, then attempted a clean installation.  Upgrade refused - said it was already installed!  Did a registry search to remove fragments, then tried again.  Now it says that this is an upgrade and it can't find a previous version installed.  Okay, that's fair and not unexpected.  So I did a full installation of version 4.7 SP8, then attempted another Version 5 upgrade.  As I said, just a repeat of above debacle.  Shampoo, rinse, repeat.  It's time to get out of this shower.If you think this is a long review, think of the long hours I spent trying to upgrade.  NEAT tech support had been absent through all of this.  Can we give negative stars? Lots of them?Compare the large number of negative customer comments for any and all of the NEAT products with the astonishing almost 100 percent positive comments for the Fujitsu ScanSnap.  Wow!  Guess that's where I'm headed now.SAD SAGA UPDATE Nov 9, 2011 - Received from NEAT Support""Response Via Email(Doug) - 11/09/2011 02:31 PMHello,We have reports from customers with similar feedback and we do apologize for anyinconvenience this may cause you, but the developers are currently working on anupdate to the software as a resolution, which will address the issue; as we dosee this is as a high priority.""Remember, this update has been more than two and a half years in the making, longer than the development cycle of most software.

I had done this before without too much trouble.Upon trying to open the program I kept getting the error message “Neat has stopped workingWindows can check online for a solution to the problemCheck for Online SolutionOr Close the program""So this time the installation failed and it took me 2 days to finally get the software to install correctly and open.

RYR0QSB1QAI49,"This pencil sharpener did not last for me, and while it was working, it didn't do the best job.  There's better pencil sharpeners out there. I'd hardly go by the reviews that were just testing this out--check out the reviews that used this one for an extended time, like in a classroom such as I have.It's not the sharpener's fault that they don't make pencils like they used to, and many have off-center leads.  However, you can get sharpeners that handle those pencils much better than this one did.  In a classroom setting, it was maybe sharpening about 70% of the pencils.  The other 30% it would sharpen down to nubs with no success.  The replacement that I got for this one sharpened about 98% of pencils.The motor on this one would also occasionally go out.  Granted, it would always come back on after resting.  In a matter of months, though, this one was really working hard to do the minimum.  There was a clear deterioration of the power and the motor.On the plus side, this one did keep chugging along, doing the bare minimum.  I ended up passing this one on to another teacher who was in a desperate situation, and she said she actually liked it.  The pencils were so difficult to sharpen that she could be assured no student was getting up to sharpen their pencil that didn't really NEED it sharpened.Now, it's not like this got used to death.  I have a small special education classroom, so it had moderate use.  It was also difficult for some of the children to align the pencil correctly, and some of the pencil-width settings seemed somewhat random and unnecessary--you could change the width with an inner wheel (the orange wheel you see in the picture on top), but the outer hole is fixed.  It's almost more of a gimmick than a real function.I'd recommend passing on this one--there's better sharpeners for a similar price that do a better job.",0,0

Some don't look anything like a tree but more like a really bad bunch of folds of leather.Like another review I wish we had options to pick from. The Tree is hard to make out on my journal. I debating if I would like to return this one and get another.After E-mailing the Seller I was told to return it and order again, No option to get a few to pick from like another review got. It's probably just the seller posting on his own reviews.Pretty Sad I really wanted to like this.

R2CWLKZE5VF2HK,"2021 Review:Update:  I have lowered my rating to 1 star because Jarbo has not responded to numerous emails, including those asking for a delivery receipt and read receipt.  If you have a problem, it looks like they will not respond.This is an update to my previous 5 star review from an earlier order.  Everything was fine with the first pair of cartridges in 2019.  But this time, when I reordered in July 2021, I had problems with a cartridge not detected error message.  First, I would note that the cartridge looks a bit different compared to the first set, including how the chip is installed.  I tried all the usual stuff to try to get it to work, like turning the printer off and unplugging.I suspect there are many folks who would not know how to correct this.  I sent an earlier email to Jarbo support.  I will let them know about the problem.After an hour of fiddling around, I removed the cover plate that houses the chip.  I eventually figured out that the chip was installed backwards with both cartridges.  As soon as I turned it around, it worked fine.Attached are 2 pictures taken from the rear of cartridge with the chip removed and lying on top of the cartridge in front of cartridge slot.  There is a small cover that fits over the slot for the chip which has to be removed to get access to the chip.  The picture with the notches on the chip facing inward is how the cartridge came from Jarbo.  THAT IS WRONG.  The second picture shows the two notches facing outward, which is correct.2019 Review:Has worked fine for me.  At 4,000 ordinary text pages, it is beginning to lighten up.  I use a high quality bright Costco paper, not the super-cheap paper.  I have shaken the cartridge once and it has returned to normal, but typically this does not last very long.  Seller advertises 6,000 pages at 5% coverage.  It is always hard to tell what a particular user's average coverage actually is, so this may only reflect some higher coverage printing that I have done.  But I would rate this as a very good deal.  Will see how subsequent cartridges do.The Samsung print manager program shows that only 50% of the toner has been used.  Not sure how it calculates remaining toner.",0,0
R331GGU60G7JI1,"It came damaged. I blame part of that on the seller and the other part on the manufacturer. The shelves were not separated by anything, so they rubbed the paint off in some spots, the manufacturer should pack it better.The mesh shelf was bend, and the box looked crushed a bit. It wasn't amazon delivery, because the amazon box was fine, just the product box was in bad shape.The top and bottom shelves hold the legs in place. The 4 middle shelves are optional. But they are NOT removable. I have a wire shelf with removable trays, and this is not like that at all. All the shelves slide in from the back, and not the front, and then the back has a bar to keep the shelves from sliding out backward (gravity would pull them out).The top and bottom shelves have backs that are angled correctly. The middle shelves have backs that are not angled correctly. The backs stick out the back of the rack. So the bar that goes on the back cannot mount correctly. By pushing on the bar hard enough to bend the shelf backs, and then cross threading the screw, it went together.I chose this rack because it was the tallest I could find (under 24 inches). But I would not buy again. If this was a 1-time mistake, hopefully, someone will reach out and send me a replacement. But I suspect they are all made this way.I gave it 2 stars because once together, it's fairly solid.  There is a fair bit of tension on that cross threaded screw I could only get 1 turn on. So I wouldn't be surprised if one day it just popped apart.",0,0
R2AMBXW8FINPYR,"Cartridges don't look like the one shown in the picture.

Sometimes it'll be okay if the ink is completely soaked out from the sponge and sometimes it won't be okay even if there's a bit of ink left in the sponge. Pretty disappointed w/ these new cartridges. I only like this seller since the black ink they sell doesn't have give off a blue-ish hue like other sellers.Also, not sure if it's just me but these don't feel like XL.

R3JPCHDZDADPPU,"I've been meaning to write a review for some time regarding the use of these inks for photographic prints.  In short, don't purchase any of this brand for photography prints.  The colors fade within a short period of time and turn a dull yellowish color.  This has happened in a number of cases within a month or two.  The prints were not in direct sunlight.For photo quality prints, use the brand name.  I use these cheap inks only for handouts or something where quality and longevity is not a concern.I simply remove and installed the Canon inks when I want to print quality photographs and leave these low cost inks installed for most other color printing.I noticed there are some complaints about the leaking with the older cartridges and it's more than likely due to not removing the pressure equalization tape before removing the main cover.

R18XORGW0LK2KH,"The reviewers who called out the QC issues with this pen line are unfortunately right. I had to return mine because it had poor ink flow and the nib was very scratchy. Since it was past Amazon's 30 day return window, I sent it to Lamy's customer service center to have it repaired. After two weeks or so I got it back with a note saying that they replaced the ink feed. Well, that fixed the ink flow problem, but the nib is still scratchy. And I tried it on good quality paper and using Noodler's ink. The nib itself looked worn and used. They could of at least given me a complimentary ink cartridge.It's disappointing, especially since I really liked the Lamy Safaris I tried at a stationery store while visiting Japan. Those pens didn't skip and the writing experience was exceptionally smooth. Now, I'm not so sure I can recommend Lamy pens. If you do buy one on Amazon, my advice is to test it right away. If you get a dud, you can still return it for a refund. Sending it to Lamy's customer service is a gamble, and there is a $9.50 shipping and handling fee. Lesson learned here.",0,0

R22FWN1DE66PKG,"UPDATED review on Nov 26, 2013:  I did not use this much (did not work well from the start), but after only a few times of using it to get lint off of clothing and rinsing the gadget per the instructions to ""renew"" the sticky, it no longer had any sticky feel or pick-up power left to it at all. The material that is supposed to remain ""forever sticky"" started to bubble up and peel away from the roller.  Trashed it, not a good purchase.Original review from Jan 1 2013:  Unhandy and does not save time as I had hoped.  It works somewhat, but the ads are very misleading, making it look like this thing works much better than it really does.  The ""sticky"" was quickly lost after making just a few swipes on the area rug.  Once the roller picks up a very small amount of lint, it is no longer ""sticky"" and you are done.  When testing it, I spent more time rinsing it off to renew the ""sticky"" than I did actually using it to pick up lint and hair.  It would have been much faster (and easier)to use the vacuum.  Wasted money.",0,0

R2ML2MMHQE12X6,"I bought these pens for my daughter who had to do a 4th grade report in cursive and I was totally sold on them and even started using them at work... until...strange things started happening to the pens and any document written w/ this ink.  The ink is heat sensitive and the writing will disappear from the paper if you leave it in the sun or a very warm place. This can be extremely disturbing when you have something important disappear on you. But wait, don't worry, all you have to do is put the paper in the freezer and the ink will reappear.  Those reviewers who think the pen doesn't have much ink have probably left the pens in a warm place like a hot car as I did. If you put the pens in the freezer, the ink will begin to show again.  They are heat sensitive, hence the name Frixion-- they erase by creating heat when you rub the ""eraser"" over the writing.

RW469ZELEVA7B,"I was dissappointed when I received this laptop stand for several reasons...1) The other reviews are absolutely true that the attached light is totally weak and useless, the plastic this stand is made of is cheap and flimsy, and with the legs fully extended, this stand will topple over at the slightest bump because the ends are rounded and barely touching the surface.2) If you are pear-shaped and full-figured like myself (size 22)or even if you are just very muscular with thick thighs, this laptop will not fit you with the legs extended to the ""first"" position. The hard, rough-edged bottom of the stand winds up digging into your legs, scratching you up and sitting crooked on your lap. In order for you to use it, you have to fully extend the legs out to its last position. This makes the laptop stand too high up to type comfortably unless you lift the split top up to tilt the laptop towards you. Which leads me to the next issue...3) The split top is held up by a single plastic piece (on one side only) that you slide into plastic slots to raise it to different angles (functioning silimilarly like a car hood).  Problem is, this plastic piece is flimsy and your laptop wobbles with every keystroke that you type.  Also, the split top is barely wide enough to fit a 15-inch laptop.  If you have a 17-inch laptop...forget about it! Your laptop won't even stay on the stand in ""split top mode"".Overall, I gave this 2 stars only because for the right sized person, with the right sized laptop or netbook, this stand could be worth it for the price. Otherwise, I wouldn't bother paying for this. You would come out just as good buying a $10 breakfast tray.",0,0

There is no view, report or anything to show all splits for 1 particular receipt to make sure totlas were correct.

No way to audit folders or receipts, etc.  For instance: a report showing all receipts by folder, or all recipts by date, etc.I cannot even run a report without the software locking up and having to use task manager to end app.  And then when I restart I LOSE ALL DATA FROM THE LAST TIME ENTERED.

R3R78EIMWPUNR2,"As a perpetually single, 35 year old man with a bad habit of moving all over the country every couple of years, I have never seen a reason to buy a full sized washer. When my trust Magic Chef portable washer have it on me after 4 years, I was looking for a reasonably priced alternative to a full size unit. This one advertised a .2 cu ft lower capacity for a reasonable price, so I thought I would try it out. I am now regretting that decision.The first thing I noticed was the size is significantly smaller. The advertised space is about 90% of my old washer, but I struggle to fit a weeks worth of shirts in it, while I never had a problem with my old machine. I have concerns about what would happen if I tried to put a comforter in this one.The second thing I noticed was the smell. It gives off a very industrial smell whenever I use it. I hope that this will go away in time, and I haven't noticed this small on my clothes, but it makes my laundry room stink whenever I use it.The last big thing I have noticed is the spin cycle is so weak, it is almost useless. I have taken things out, and they are still dripping wet. So wet that I can wring them out with little effort. I was accustomed to my old machine, where things came out very dry. At the end, on that machine, the spin cycle stopped working, and things came out of it only a little wetter then they come out of this one. You can see how much water is left after a normal cycle in the picture. It is a little hard to see, but there is about a a cup of water in the drum on the right. Edit 10/12/2022 I was able to solve this problem by putting the machine on top of a rack. Apparently the water drainage pump is not strong enough to lift the drain water to a standard laundry hookup height, so putting it on the rack has solved that problem. Clothes still come out wetter then I would like, but better. This is a fatal flaw in my opinion, considering I had to spend an additional $80 for a sturdy enough rack on which to put this. I really wish I had spent that extra $80 on a better machine.

R3HB84Z2TT1WJ0,"This product is being sold as an ""Epson Projector Lamp"", which it is not. It is a lamp made by someone else for an Epson projector. Epson makes their own lamps, which is a primary reason I bought the Epson projector instead of a Panasonic. I had two different Panasonic projectors prior to this Epson and grew tired of the extremely high cost of replacing the lamp. I have no idea how this projector lamp will perform. The lamp which came new with the projector failed after 240 hours, so it is possible this one could actually outlast the genuine Epson lamp. That is not my objection. My objection is selling something in a misleading manner, using the product description to deceive people into believing this is an Epson product. It is not. My one star rating is based on that deception, not on actual performance, for which I have nothing to report at this point in time but will update in a few months (or less, who knows) when appropriate. Whether this vendor will still be around at that time is another unknown, and another reason to buy a genuine Epson product.UPDATE 04-05-13: Shortly after posting this review I was contacted by the seller, who offered a substantial discount if I would remove this poor review. I refused. In my opinion, selling this lamp as ""Epson"" is false and misleading and I will not take part in misleading others. The last projecter bulb I used, a genuine Epson purchased through an authorized Epson dealer, just failed at 1750 hours. This bulb is definitely not as bright as that one, and flickers when on anything less than the highest brightness setting. I do not recommend this bulb or doing business with this seller.Update 08-08-14: Despite a definite flicker, which has continued since it was new, this bulb has actually outlasted my last bulb, which was a genuine Epson product. This projector is used nearly every day, two to four hours per day. While not as bright as the original Epson bulb, it has significantly outlasted that bulb and at less than half the price of the genuine bulb, it may be worth the risk to some for the savings. However, a bulb explosion can do damage to your projector. Because this bulb has exceeded by expectations in terms of its life, I am revising my rating to two stars. Marketing a product in a misleading manner cost this product two stars, and the flicker and reduced brightness over the original Epson bulb cost it the final star.",0,0

R2TZ6TETVFAU60,"Let me explain why 1 star:  this is not a bad ink, but it does NOT do what it says it will do.  If it was just advertised as a regular ink, with no anti-feather/anti-bleed guarantee, I'd give maybe 4 stars.  But its not.  The name of the ink is ""X-Feather"", so you'd expected it not to feather, right?  That's the whole purpose of the ink.  But it does.  I experienced feathering and bleed-through on cheap and mid-grade (but still inexpensive) paper with the noodler's black X-Feather.  AND with Noodler's bulletproof American Eel.  NOT using a flex nib, or any other hardware that may make bleeding worse.  Using the pilot metropolitan with fine nib (which is very well made and was brand-new, so not a pen problem).  Not to be a grumpy ink hater (but kind of because I AM grumpy about this), but I don't really understand everyone's hype about the Noodler's X-Feather.  All of my experience with it has still been plenty feathery with substantial bleed-through on cheap paper.  Disappointed in Noodlers:(  does anyone have any recommendations for non-feather, non-bleed ink that doesn't harm pens and require tons of cleaning/maintenance?",0,0

R2GDTWI483P8H2,"After reading so many great reviews for this table, maybe my expectation were too high. The first table? Was in pieces by the time i received it, but i notified the seller and was sent a better packaged one.I liked the light feature, though i rarely used it because i didn't use the table for reading or eating in the dark. The mouse area was really nice and i even liked the part where my netbook stood. I was able to stand my netbook as high as i wished, without having it fall on me. The legs height was really perfect for me. I recommend for those who use it on their beds to lower the legs whenever you get down from the bed or trying to find a comfortable position. Otherwise it will send your things flying to the bed or floor.The novelty of course came to an end just weeks after i bought it. When i lifted the area where i was going to place my netbook cracked almost in half. As a girl, it would have been quite amusing, had i not needed the table at that moment to work on a paper. It was not like i did anything different or used too much force (I have never won any arm-wrestling against another girl).In the end, if you do not mind that the material may come apart any day you use it, i say go for it.

R13Q55PJ2GIRY5,"I normally never write reviews even though I rely on them heavily before purchasing an item. I was hoping with this item it was mostly user error. I was wrong. I followed the instructions to the letter so it is NOT user error. A previous review stated that this is like the window cling decorations you can buy. It may STICK the same way but it is by far a WAY cheaper material. It's like a cheap black trash bag. You have to be exceedingly careful when separating the ""perforated"" sheets because it tears EXTREMELY easily. A previous post was also correct about it letting light in at the edges. I tried to take a previous reviewers advice and cut a little extra to compensate...but it wont stick fully to the window unless all edges are ON the actual window...so you HAVE to cut it a little short. I cleaned my windows very thoroughly and cut all my pieces ahead of time. Since I cut just a little extra I had to remove the piece from the window and cut off the extra since it wouldn't work unless the whole piece was on the window. BIG mistake. This crap will absolutely NOT stick more than one time. I have no idea how people use this more than once. It's on the windows for now (thank goodness for ten sheets) but there's light peeking in everywhere.

This did  problem did not improve with the recommended online Epson maintenance suggestions.  You also cannot access the printhead because of the printer design.Most frustrating really is that the Epson Customer Service Center required me to go through their online recommendations of printhead cleaning X 3 AGAIN even though it was completed recently and they wouldn't even provide additional options for management until after this was done.

To get the pet hair off my couch, I had to rinse it at least 7 times and I still had hairs left over, and my cat doesn't shed nearly as much as others. The product photos are definitely not accurate - there's no way it could pick up that type of thick pet dander and leave the surface below completely clean like it shows. That's blatant false advertising. It's really just not that effective, but I guess it's something you could have laying around if you just needed to take a quick swipe of something minor.

R3IILJ8NADBV7B,"This is a great concept and mostly works as described. It's not perfect for me for two reasons. First, it will not suction to our bathroom wall. I assume that's because the wall isn't entirely smooth and, in fairness to Elmer's, the package says in small print this item may fall if attached to an uneven surface (it won't suction at all on our wall).  Second, it would be more useful if the cup was a little deeper.  My goal was to reduce bathroom countertop clutter, and I had planned on using this holder for 3 tubes of creams that are part of my teen son's acne regimen in order to get them off the counter, but still leave them in plain view (because if stored in a cabinet he won't think use them). Two tubes fit but the third is rounded and won't fit, so there's no point using it for that purpose. But what does work well is that this attaches firmly to the mirrored medicine cabinet and holds my son's toothbrush and toothpaste perfectly, so it's functional as it gets those items off the countertop. And I really appreciate that the plastic cup as well as the suction portion remove easily for washing. It's an okay product with a variety of possible uses- though it would be more practical and helpful if it was just a little deeper. I give it 3 stars.Update: I've knocked a star off because this gizmo ultimately wasn't functional enough to bother with it. The toothbrush holder idea I had wasn't as good as I thought as it gets scummy too fast, and I was constantly washing it. For holding pencils or pens, there is nowhere to adhere it to so that it was actually helpful. I put it away and it will end up in the recycle bin eventually.",0,0

This time and the next 3 times, it wrote the field name ""FIRST NAME"" on my tags, plus my guests last name. I had to go in and manually type in the first name of everyone. I printed them to PDF to make sure everything stayed correct, then printed them to plain paper and held them up to the light with the blank tags in front.

They came out terrible and the texture of the paper made the color even worse looking. So why did i give it two stars instead of one?

Of the 4 tags I ironed on exactly as instructed, only 1 tag remained halfway on! This was apx 10 days after taking the time to apply them high heat cotton setting, warmed up iron as directed. They were snug with NO peeling the day I did them. I wasted my time $ and effort on them as they didn’t even make it through one single wash!! The only reason I gave them 2 stars is because I can baste stitch them onto the rest of the clothes I buy for her from now on since I received so many. I would’ve done that to begin with had I known. She just turned 16 with autism and feels devastated to see  her clothes worn by others and/or disappear and I thought this was the answer. It was NOT! Now the whole pile of 16th bday clothes will be up for grabs on laundry day. I’ll spend the time to stitch them on instead of sending them back so I’ll give it a star for that.",0,0

R1X5TSKHIVG7RU,"Never believe Amazon Reviews as solid leads to quality, it's their way of earning greater sales, follow instinct of those who have actually used reviewed items. I am a Prime member, but soon will not be after almost 3 years of waste.  Do the math it's not worth it unless used at least twice a month, and some of their items like this Uni-Ball Signo 207, for a Uni-Ball pen it's second place to Promorx writing instrumemts, neither is a quality reliable pen.  I purchased both in need of pens, but next time I will buy a pack of crayons at least they are reliable without skipping.The highest quality and reliability I have found in any writing instrument is by Pilot 0.7mm; I use a lot of pens in my work, and Pilot has been the best around since 80's.  35 years should prove Pilot means quality, years before any Amazon or Google was ever around; so, actual users are the ones to depend upon for your decision making process, not an online company.

R3GQ7G1NLHMNUM,I have used a retail pricing gun for 15 years so I know how to use these. I still read the instructions to be sure though.

The MTech Xtreme Tactical Pen is not a good writing instrument, which other reviews confirm, and it would not make a great defensive weapon either.  The crown is not sharp and would barely annoy a potential attacker.  You could do more damage with your fingers, and the tip end (with the point retracted) would be less effective than a standard BIC pen.  Moreover, trying to unscrew the device to expose the tip for writing usually results in the device separating with the threads becoming exposed (as noted by another reviewer).  Then you have to screw the parts together again and begin the process anew.  There are much better tactical pens available from Amazon including the two S & W varieties.",0,0

RXX3AYY8M7J11,"I have to say I'm really disappointed. My purpose behind purchasing an A5 travelers notebook was to carry a journal and a watercolor sketchbook at the same time (I learned for the first time that you can get watercolor inserts on amazon and etsy). I was deciding between this book and one from another company, ultimately choosing this one because I know September Leather is supposed to be a decent company. I don't think I'll be able to purchase from them again because what I received, while still usable, must be a used product.The cover is extremely distressed with scratches and marking throughout, as well as the spine showing clear wear from bending. The little piece of leather around the band is extremely distressed as well. One of the three notebooks included had an unusual stain and a black, charcoal-like deposit between the first page and the cover. I ended up ripping out that first page and in turn lost the back page.On top of this, the cover is not really meant for A5 notebooks. The watercolor insert I purchased is a true A5 size (5.8x8.3 inches) however it sticks out of the cover if I have it installed with the 2 pre-installed notebooks. I should have read the reviews prior to purchasing, otherwise I would have known that ""A5"" refers to the size of the actual cover, not the size of the books it holds. This is rather misleading and further confirmed by the fact that the 3 notebooks inserted are not a true A5 size; the horizontal edge measurement is slightly shorter, possibly around 5.5in rather than 5.8in. Therefore, in order to use my appropriately sized watercolor insert without it being exposed, I have to remove one of the notebooks and only use a 2 notebook system. Luckily for me, I only really need 2 notebooks as my Hobonichi Techo Weeks serves as my planner/journal.Overall, I'm not too happy with this purchase. Is it usable? Absolutely. But if you're a huge notebook/journal fan like myself and have a particular love of leather journals, there are certain things you want to experience for yourself. You want every scratch on your leather to be from your own hands and actions. You want to develop that lovely, aged patina yourself. You want the binding to be weathered as a sign of your frequent use, not someone else's. Receiving a notebook in this condition is a bit disheartening because I'm thinking about all the wonderful things that I am missing out on because of my notebook's current state. I can't even take the time to return it because I desperately needed my cover for my watercolor insert. So this will have to do for now until I have the opportunity to replace it. All I can say now is that this is the last I purchase a September Leather item, unless I receive evidence that I will not be disappointed again.",0,0

R33QXE8EC3X0A9,"ORIGINAL REVIEW:  So far so good.  These work fine in our printer once we acknowledge HP's warning about non-genuine cartridges.  Time will tell how well they do.UNFORTUNATE UPDATE:  I initially just swapped a couple of the cartridges, waiting on the originals to be empty before swapping.  The first couple cartridges worked fine (hence the original review).  Then we swapped the old Magenta with this one, and it leaked ink all over the inside of the printer.  Had to spend a lot of time cleaning up the printer.  Tried a different brand of generics, and they were junk too.  Sadly, I had ordered my mother a set of these for her printer, and she had problems as well (thankfully no leaks causing a mess).I finally gave up on these generics and opted to subscribe to HP Instant Ink, and we have a mostly reliable printer again.  I get occasional print defects, but I believe they are the result of damage to the printhead by these junk cartridges (or quite possibly damage resulting from us fiddling around so much trying to get these to work)",0,0

R399RH9NDAATGR,"The idea was good, the execution impossibly bad.Don't waste your time. Seriously. Just don't. If you need more evidence, go check the reviews at the Home Depot website.Let me explain the problem: The ""smaller"" problem is that the pin is built to work by hitting the molding. Since I bought the product specifically to avoid hitting the molding, we already have not met the goal. But the bigger problem is the fact that the pin doesn't stop the door. Unless I want a 45 degree opening in my hallway. This is ideal for a cat, ferret, Dachshund, or Bichon. It barely big enough for my Labrador.As for me, I'd prefer that my hallway door open to a 90 degree angle. Just sayin'. But when I select that setup, the door opens at least 100 degrees, probably 110, possibly 115, but I can't say for sure because the doorknob has already hit the wall (hard) and I'd prefer not to push the knob all the way into the wall just to get a good measurement with my protractor.

I remember seeing people say that there was no difference except that the G-tec-c was the American version of the Hi-tec-c. THERE IS MOST DEFINITELY A DIFFERENCE. My friend gave me four of her hi-tec-c pens and I have run through 3/4 of them with no problem at all and they have become one of my favorite and go-to pens to use.

R2FOQP5BKSR1Y3,"I was very excited about adding a spot to mount my Apple Pencil to my current iPad Pro case. Unfortunately, this product is not a great solution. The first issue I noticed was that after I attached two of these to my iPad case, my pencil was sticky. Apparently, there was excess adhesive inside the elastic strap that got all over my pencil. This made me very sad. Eventually, the excess adhesive transferred out of there and stopped being an issue. After a couple of weeks the elastic started getting stretched out from what I'd consider pretty mild use. Then a few weeks later the elastic started fraying and fell apart.I really don't like to write a bad review, but this product is not worth purchasing.If you found this review helpful please click that button and make my sacrifice of wasting time buying this and writing about it worth something.

Not quite as easily as they should have - but they clicked into place.The Black cartridges were another story.  The first one did not install easily at all.  When I finally got it in, it did not click into place as it should have - it moved back and forth if touched.  I printed a sample.  The black did not work.  I then installed the second black cartridge.  It was difficult and did not click into place, but it did print ONE page.  The next morning, I went to print more and it said the cartridge had failed.  Since it was new, I tried several times to remove and install.  It would go back and forth between accepting the cartridge or saying they were not installed or that there was a failure with the cartridge.After doing this 3 times, I give up.",0,0

R1KIPHL0NY8X4K,"BE AWARE that these pages are NOT 9.25 inches wide as another reviewer says. They are slightly wider, 9 3/8, or 9.375 inches, which may not seem like much, but for my purposes it was too big of a difference. I wanted to intersperse these in my scrapbooking binder, which is a large heavy duty D-ring binder with standard sheet protectors in it. When I was researching which picture sleeves would be a similar size, these 4x6 sleeves seemed like a very good fit. Not perfect, but close enough to not stand out from the sheet protectors. WRONG. They stick out between the protectors AND stick out from the edge of the binder. It would look terrible, so I can't use these after all. I will probably return them, though I hate doing that for the waste of shipping back. But $16 for something that was misadvertised (it was almost impossible to get the exact measurements from the item description in the first place!) and is useless?? Nah.

R3AM0YDE20TSSO,"While browsing for Bluetooth keyboards on Amazon, I noticed loads of tables and stands dedicated to laptop use.  I had previously decided that once I had purchased a keyboard I would need its own little stand, but I was thinking more like a TV tray.  Seeing all those choices, I convinced myself buying one in favor of a cheap TV tray was the right, even responsible, decision.Well, it turned out that that wide array of options were all pretty identical - so I went with the model that had a lot of positive reviews, was qualified for Prime shipping, and was decently priced.  That would be the product I am reviewing today, the ""iCraze Adjustable  Vented  Laptop  Table  Laptop  Computer  Desk  Portable  Bed  Tray  Book  Stand  Multifunctional & Ergonomics  Design  Dual  Layer  Tabletop (Black).""  <---[First red flag, looking back...]When it arrived, I was thankful that the unit was basically pre-built, and all that I, the customer, needed to do was to attach the small (maybe about 5"" squared) mouse pad extension to the table/desk.This was the first ""uh-oh moment"" - there are NO INSTRUCTIONS for this item.  Not a single measly slip of paper, or even a website printed anywhere on the packaging.  My shipping slip was the lone paper in the box.  Attempting to remain optimistic, I hoped that the lack of literature was indicative of just how easy this would be...attach that little mouse pad and all done...oy.Before committing to anything, I studied the product's Amazon page; looking closely at the pictures and reading the more helpful comments.  Many people mentioned the lack of instructions, the lousy mouse pad extension and its enigmatic ways, but I could not find any accurate, tried-and-true procedures.What kept throwing me off was the fact that in EVERY product display picture provided by iCraze, the mouse extension was upside-down, and I was determined to get mine to look like the model...  Well, I'm here to tell you that either the picture provided for this product is of a different model or was assembled with different parts, because the effectiveness of their implied method was paramount to using a Lisa Frank sticker and rubbing a good luck charm.Ultimately, the mouse pad rests precariously atop the table's side, using a lip that fits into a groove on the tray top so it won't fall off.  If you are super delicate, then you are probably alright.  If you move the stand, bump into it, or put too much weight on it, then you will probably not be alright.The next issue to deal with were two small, black, plastic clips that were just randomly provided.  Thinking they were included for balancing the wobbly mouse pad, I fiddled some.  When that failed, I found myself again at the product's page, close to beginning a return/refund procedure.Then, written in a review that was lost in the middle of the pack, I discovered these plastic chunks were supposedly meant for securing a laptop to the table top.  HOW?!  These are not your standard two-prong clips, guys:  these are small, fat, boxy chunks of plastic with strangely shaped sides and a slot that won't even slide onto the stand's top, let alone with a laptop in between!  But I don't use the product for a laptop anyway, just a keyboard & mouse, so no harm.The basic construction design and quality of the iCraze table is my last major gripe, for it is lacking.  At the time of purchase, I had judged from the pictures (again, BIG MISTAKE) that it would be perfect for use in a normal chair.  Sadly, this is not the case.  In my mind, the last of the three sections that make up the legs would fold 90 degrees parallel to the floor, while the other two would be straight upright, thus creating a sturdy and height-appropriate laptop table.  Unfortunately, this is achievable only in a seat made for a small child, as the table's top couldn't reach farther than my knees.Conclusion:  I have yet to decide the fate of this item, but am totally disappointed and feel misled by this company.  Their entire description that they provided should be scrapped.  In its place, a write-up of a nifty breakfast-in-bed tray that has a couple crappy fans.",0,0

RVQNB8PJ5PPF4,"I at first gave this product 5 stars, because once you get your images printed on the paper, it does beautifully in transferring them to your sublimation blanks. The colors are great and everything looks fabulous.HOWEVER:  I started out sublimating on an Epson Workforce 30. After a couple weeks, I noticed I was having trouble getting the paper to feed through the printer. I figured there was something wrong with the printer, so I called Epson and since they don't make the Workforce 30 anymore, they 'upgraded' me to a WF-2530.  I got the printer, it printed about a dozen prints and stopped taking the paper through the printer, just like the Workforce.  I again blamed the printer, it was under warranty so they swapped me for another printer, and about 5 prints in, it stopped wanting to take the paper again. I decided Epson printers were no good for the paper thickness, so I ordered a Canon. Guess what? It also did not want to feed this paper.  So after wasting way too much money on refillable ink cartridges and expensive sublimation ink for three different printers, I have concluded that the problem is not the printers, it's this paper.  So if you can get your printer to take this paper, you'll be happy with the results. IF YOU CAN GET YOUR PRINTER TO TAKE THIS PAPER!",0,0

RCAVIM0XEFCUT,"(NOTE: see my update on NeatWorks ver 5 below)I have been using NeatReceipts for a couple of years now.  I generally like the product, but I am now using BOTH the 'Classic ver 1.5.9"" and the new Ver 4.0 software because NeatWorks broke a covenant with its' early adopters.  They broke two of the cardinal rules of product development (1) never, ever, under any circumstances forget your early customers and their data and (2) never remove vital features from the product.First, they ""forgot"" their ""Classic ver 1.5.9"" users.  Versions of the software from 2.0 up thru the current ver 4.1 cannot recognize or import any of the receipts or documents scanned into the earlier version.  I have personally talked to them about this for almost 2 years.  At first, in early 2007, they repeatedly stated that they were hard at work on a migration solution.  We depended on that statement, telling them how important it was for us to be able to access our archived data - for inventories, insurance and tax records.But they finally just abandoned this effort and offered everyone a discount to upgrade to a later version.  How is that going to help with restoring archived data?  The data and file formats for their .elrec and .eldoc seem fairly simple - a scanned image and some recognized text fields.  Why can't they import those formats like they allow for jpeg and tiff images?They offered no acceptable reasons beyond that we are no longer working on that feature and ""would you like to upgrade?"".  They seem oblivious to the frustrations they have caused a large number of their early customers.  We even communicated with Rafi Spero, one of the companies owners.  If he couldn't make it happen, you know they don't care about you as a customer.  BEWARE THIS COMPANY.Secondly:  The ""Classic"" version allowed users to create folders and subfolders, etc.  This was a fantastic way to organize receipts for cash, various credit cards, checks and debits, by year and then by month.  Or to organize a copy of receipts for an inventory by broad categories and then further by store, year or vendor.  So the initial features of both subfolders and the ability to copy receipts from yearly tax records to inventory folders was extremely useful and helpful in elimnating paperwork clutter.The new ver 4 software does not support nested folders or copying receipts to other folders.  Every time you scan a receipt, it goes into a folder.  But all folders are on the same level.  You can show and hide folders, but this is an extremely clumsy process and causes users a lot of extra work in trying to organize their invoices and receipts.  If you want to copy a receipt, you have to scan it AGAIN.  How brain-dead is that?Bottom Line:  This company has proven that, at their convenience, they will ignore or abandon prior versions of the software and remove vital features.To fix some of their current short-coming, as mentioned above, it would not surprise me to see them create a new version of their software that is incompatible with what they are selling today.DO NOT TRUST them with any vital data that you may need in the future.UPDATE:  2-11-2010 - I have been given a preview of the new NeatWorks ver5 software.  I don't know when it will be released but it seems to have (finally) added back in some of the features that went missing with ver 2 and onward.  Now they also have a chance to allow for importing old receipts ("".elrec"" files) from their ""Classic"" users.  If they do Import "".elrec"" files many Classic users will be happy that their data is no longer ""orphaned"".  I will then change my opinion and rating of NeatWorks and their products because they did admit to these past mistakes, listen and respond to their customers and ""the true test of your character is how you respond to those mistakes.""",0,0

I have two minor things that made me knock off two stars.First, the grammar mistakes on the cover, such as ""capricon"" and ""pieces"". I believe this should lower the value of the planner, for $35 ish dollars, you expect it to be grammatically correct. Everything else on the inside is precise, as far as I can tell.Second, the advertisement suggests that you will be receiving bonus stickers and I never received any stickers at all. This upsets me because that was a deciding factor between this planner and another planner. This is deceiving and that would have ultimately made me pick another planner, had I known that there weren't going to be any stickers included.As for the pros, I do see myself using this planner because I like the way it is organized. It just works for me. I counted 12 months and it has 5 weeks per month. It seems sturdy enough to where I don't see any future problems with the pages coming off. The binding is very well put. The rose-gold color is gorgeous and it's exactly what I was looking for. I wanted a specific layout for my planner and I'm glad this is able to satisfy that.

R2HLE2IDRZNKDK,"As other reviewer noted, the instruction manual was a joke.  It had 6 ""simple"" steps that required 100 guesses to get things right.  A great example is when you start out with step number 1, it states 3 different screw sizes are required (all of which fit in all 3 holes) and you get to figure out which one goes where based on analysis of future steps.  It also has you build the thing upside down in the instructions, which makes the instruction easy, but is not practical when you realize you build the little shelf part first and are supposed to somehow build the desk with that on the bottom.  Anyway, finally got it all together and it looks great.  I went to move it into the corner of the room and one of the leg connectors broke.  I can't imagine taking apart and returning so I'm just going to be very careful with it.

R2PMBJRZCEQ5U7,"...OK - the disclosure: I do not own and have not purchased, tried, sampled or otherwise set my hands on the 'latest' NeatReceipts scanner/software. I did buy the 'full' scanner about 3-4 years ago. As I recall, I had a terrible time getting it installed. And, once installed, it simply did not do what it said it would do. Not even close. I could have worked faster with a Big Chief tablet and a No. 2 pencil. So...why this review...to thank everyone who recently tried the 'system' and gave it a lowly review (lots of 1 stars...possibly because you can't give 0 stars). I had my credit card out, ready to order, when I thought I should check the reviews. Glad I did. Sadly, this is a very poor product -- well-conceived, poorly executed. Sad....because many, many people really want and/or need something like this that works. The plus -- at least for the company -- is that people keep buying it. To those people, please call me. I have an electric car that runs on water, gets 200 mpg, goes from 0 to 60 in 3.5 seconds and drives itself. Well, I don't actually have one -- but I'm thinking of building one -- and you can hold your place if you just send me the same amount you wasted on a NeatReceipts scanner.",1,1
RN67J2EJCW0TG,"So I had a 'Heavy Duty' chair I got on sale a couple of years back, and I love it. The piston went bad about a year ago, which wasn't a big deal, but then the base became broken a few months ago as well, which made it very wobbly. I bought a new piston and base at the same time because the rest of the chair was still in excellent shape. The piston was rated at 1000 lbs. The base (the product I am reviewing here) was rated at 500 lbs. My original chair was rated at 330 lbs, and boy was that accurate - right after it broke I weighed myself and sure enough I was just TWO lbs over! So I bought what I thought was even better parts than my original, fixed it, and it was great... for two weeks. It became wobbly again, but I ignored it, and last night the chair literally broke off and I ended up on the floor (I am both large AND old, so it HURT). Apparently the metal tore like tissue paper. My old base (OEM) was rated at 2/3 that, and I got almost three years out of it. The 500 lbs rating is BS, and I am VERY dissatisfied (Because now I have to replace it again, and I am very annoyed about that). If your as big as me or bigger, look for another brand - this one is made terrible. I am going to try and track down a replacement OEM part this time (the piston, on the other hand, seems to be holding up fine). Oh, and the pivot lock mechanism only lasted two days!",0,0

R345K5JLDYOYYQ,Well let's just say you get what you pay for.  This lead is by far the most brittle I've ever had.  It breaks so unbelievably easily.  In addition it seems to slide out much farther than you would expect from one click of your pencil.  That aspect is pretty frustrating considering you have to keep the lead a  very short length if you want to minamize the breakage.  This is especially annoying during exams when your lead keeps breaking and you keep clicking your pencil and then an astronomical amount of lead comes out just for it to break again within 30 seconds.  I'm currently studying for exams and I took the time out of my busy schedule just to leave this review so others know.  If you want a lot of cheap lead then look no further.  For the future I would just prevent the hassle and just spend a couple extra bucks to get a product that doesn't break so often.,0,0

I've read other reviews saying they really liked this eraser, but if the batches are this inconsistent I wouldn't bother wasting money on this.

R3TPD19SJNLAE,"Buyer beware! I read a bunch of reviews before I bought this scanner. It seemed as though the biggest common complaint was Neat's technical support. The fact there were so many reviews about support should have been a red flag. I thought, ""Why would I need support for a simple scanner"". Apparently for the same reason so many others did!After loading the software and plugging the scanner into my computer, I opened the Neatworks software but couldn't scan anything because it said no scanner was connected. I fumbled around their support links and tried their troubleshooting ideas with no success. They have no phone # for support, you have to submit an email. It was two hours before I got a response.Their first suggestion was to make sure the power button on the back was on. Seems like a reasonable first suggestion except for the fact that the scanner doesn't have a power button. After trying their other ideas, I replied back that I had no success. The next day I get my next message from them, this time suggesting I try a different power cord. Another great idea except the cord has a unique connection into the scanner. Where am I supposed to get another cord?! Again I followed the other suggestions with no success.It has now been 30+ hours since my last reply and I have heard nothing back from them. The scanner is now boxed up ready for return.",0,0

R1WKUYVYIKYBL3,"I bought these pens hoping for something that would work better, last longer and hopefully not smear much, compared to the Sharpie® pens that we currently use.  The claims made on this page were that they are fast-drying, smear and water proof, and permanent for plastic tubes.  More importantly for me, the claim was made that they are also resistant to many chemicals and solvents.  I was pretty excited to try something that might finally work for us.  To test them, I performed the following experiment:I marked seven 13x100 borosilicate (""glass"") tubes with the name of the treatment I would use, along with a patch of black scribble, and additionally stuck a piece of lab tape to each tube and wrote the name of the treatment there as well.  Treatments performed included placing a small amount of each solvent onto a fresh Kim-Wipe and lightly rubbing the patch of scribble as well as the writing on the lab tape, or in one case, I just rubbed a bare-skin finger against the writing to see how it held up to skin oils.  I left one control to which I did nothing.  The solvents used follow:1)  methanol2)  reagent alcohol (90% ethanol, 5% each methanol and isopropyl alcohol)3)  ethyl acetate4)  HPLC-grade water5)  skin-oil (bare-fingered rubbing)6)  control (no treatment, for comparison)Additionally, I added ~5mL of water to another tube, placed it in the -80°C freezer for 45 minutes, removed it and let it thaw for 45 minutes.I then allowed the ink to dry for a few hours, just to make sure it was nice and set.Using a fresh Kim-Wipe coated with the appropriate solvent, against each tube I lightly rubbed both the scribble-patch and writing on the lab tape.  I was very discouraged to see that the writing/scribble was instantly removed on each of the tubes to which non-aqueous solvent was applied.  The tube rubbed with a bare-finger (to see how the ink would hold up to skin oil), the tube rubbed with a water-coated Kim-Wipe and the tube which was subjected to the Freeze/Thaw cycle and subsequently scrubbed with a clean Kim-Wipe (I did not wait for the condensation on the outside of the glass to evaporate) all looked good – pretty much the same as the control, to which I did nothingI went back onto Amazon and re-read the product description and saw that these pens were intended for use on plastics so I went back to the drawing board, and performed the same experiments on some small plastic (polypropylene) 1.5mL tubes, which we use to store aliquots of various things.  Without exception, I got the exact same results.  On the upper-side of each of the 1.5mL tubes is a small, translucent, “frosted” (as opposed to the remainder of the tube which is smooth and transparent) patch, which is where contents information is intended to be written.  This patch also was tested and the results were consistent with everything else here.I took and attached a photo of the glass tubes (again, the plastic ones all had the exact same result, but the glass ones were more photogenic).These pens were over $30 when shipping was factored in!  The only reason I gave this product 2 stars is that it works as described solely for water, skin oils, and survival of cryogenic temperatures. The ink itself also seems a bit darker, and better quality than the Sharpie® pens I’ve been using.  But the writing from these pens did not “resist” any of the solvents I tried in any way, and the purported solvent resistance is literally the only reason I went with these guys.  I’m not sure what the fellow reviewer who claimed “almost nothing will take it off” tried, but it most definitely didn’t hold up to my tests, which is unfortunate.  I had high-hopes for this product.",0,0
R2QNRSLWE567YO,"Two days ago, I received this 901 black economy cartridge, because it was a few dollars cheaper than the standard cartridge and I don't usually print all that much at one time. Today, I ran out of ink. I did have a large file I tried to print (key word: try), and a couple of smaller print jobs, probably around 160 pages total, but didn't expect the ink to run out THAT quickly. That's a ridiculous cost per page of about $.09, plus paper. For what I got out of it, the print quality was good (hence the 2 stars), but I'll go back to the standard cartridge, which gives me a far longer life and far more pages, for only a few dollars more. And I'll be able to print the entire project (I ended up missing 15 pages because this cartridge has a life span of a gnat -- or maybe less!). Very disappointed in this purchase.",0,0

Epson programmed an internal counter and once you reach what THEY have previously decided is the maximum copies it can make, you have to throw it away.  I've had one of these for just over a year, and I used it a lot.  It was still making wonderful looking copies but because their automatic internal counter says ""the ink pads are at the end of their service life"" it shuts itself down and will not make more copies. You have to throw it away.  The Epson site provides you with some access codes to extend the life a few more copies (which I did) but now even that won't work any more and I had to throw it away--a 1 year old printer. Insane.

R28T4UKQU97DOP,"I purchased this safe after a moderate amount of research and thought all was well until last week.

I could have easily used a hammer or crowbar to get it open but it would obviously ruin the safe.Here's what I can say at this point:1) It's a sturdy safe by a well-known brand but the locking function should be considered a deterrent, not something that will prevent access.2) Check to see if the correct keys were sent. I read many reviews and several complained of the key breaking off inside the lock. I would probablt would also have broken them but decided to call a pro. The locksmith confirmed the keys I received were the wrong ones.3) I like the safe itself--it is heavy and more than adequate for what I need it for.4) Finally (seems kind of obvious now...) before putting something in the safe, make sure the keys you received work!It is after the warranty period, so I spent $100 to get the safe opened without ruining it and to have new keys made that actually work.

RXAG4QDDHUQY5,"I couldn't find anything good about this product1) The case never completely closes. Despite the picture that makes it look like sturdy metal, the fasteners are actually made of extremely flimsy plastic that absolutely don't pull the cover down. The cover is really just resting on top, and the fasteners are purely cosmetic.2) The case is extremely heavy. Do no think about taking it and walking away with it if there is a fire or flood.3) The mechanism that holds the cover up is made of the thinnest plastic materials they could apparently find, and are therefore extremely fragile.If classified in the toys section, I am sure my kids would give it a good rating. But as something you would trust your most valuable documents and belongings in a case of fire or floods, seriously not.",0,0

R1MA4DVBZBTGKY,"This software does an awful job of reading what documents say, particularly business cards.  The address of one of my contacts was in South Carolina and after scanning it in, the Neatworks software read it as North Dakota.  I have had to go through and review the file for each biz card I have scanned to ensure the way the software read it was accurate.  I bought the item to make this process smoother and it has been just as much work as if I had entered them into my address book manually.  It doesn't read international phone numbers or addresses, either and it often takes TM symbol and thinks it is a letter, and then adds that to the company name.  I do not reccommend purchasing this product, it is a real disappointment and more work than help. It also significantly slows my computer (which is less than a year old) making it difficult to switch tabs when waiting for the cards to be filed into the inbox of the software.",0,0
R2ZIQDSBOGLT5Q,"I hate to break the 5 star rating, & maybe I just received a dud, but this was the most awful set of Sharpies I've ever bought. The tip of the teal/turquoise marker was completely torn off, all markers with very few exceptions were going dry & marked scratchy, esp the 4 neon colors. And the bronze metallic was completely dry. I've never had a problem with Sharpies before. I use Letraset & Prismacolor markers for the most part, but I always keep fine & ultra fine Sharpies on hand bc they work like a charm, & their red marker just can't be beat. I was more disappointed than I can say when I opened these & found them unusable. However, Amazon is making it right for me as they always do. Instead of getting this pkg for exchange I went with the 24ct fine Electro Pop & 6ct metallic. I was afraid of receiving another bad batch with this particular set.",0,0

R1TW43BHFIMZT2,"Actually, I would like Amazon to realize some products truly deserve a 0-star rating, because giving this 1-star makes me seriously cringe.

There is no scent whatsoever. I not only asked my boyfriend for a second opinion, I asked 3 other people besides him! Not even a 16-year-old(with an amazing sense of smell that is uncanny) could catch even a hint of a scent. As for the people I trusted while reading the reviews who talked about their wonderful scent-it truly makes me wonder if these were not paid for by the seller-because I wasted my money trusting those reviews.

R1RW25E03ZS0CL,"My 8th grader son is taking Geometry this year. He needed a protractor/compass set for the class. This appeared to have good reviews  and my son loved all the options it came with. Had I of written a review before he actually used the items, I probably would have given them 4.5-5 stars considering all he got for such a reasonable price. However, he has attempted to use the compass’ a week now, and they are all worthless.. they all have the issue of not locking into position, so when you go to measure an angle and then move the compass to duplicate the angle, it’s not in the same position. This has caused major frustration. Also, on 2 of the compass’, the point where the 2 legs connect is very weak, it moves about oddly, if you open the legs you can see the broken plastic piece that is supposed to make it open evenly. This is with minimal use and me in the same room as my 8th grader (no siblings) so I know they haven’t been abused. The plastic protractor is ok. It did fall in my wooden floor and the center pivoting bar broke off, but my son was able to snap that into place, so we were happy about that. I gave it 2 stars because the protractors are still good, as well as the 6” ruler, but the main reason for buying this set was for the compass’ and they, unfortunately, proved to be worthless to us. We couldn’t get the 4 provided compass’ to last a week. Disappointed, because we threw away the packaging, or we would have returned it since we are still within the return window.",0,0

R2BLI4B1QLPNG2,"Bought this model based on a Consumer Reports review.  The first unit we received printed white lines through photos and graphics and the output was grainy.

It smeared ink on both our office letterhead and Epson photo paper. And photos and graphics were still grainy.  We have a color laserjet that's 600x600 dpi that produces better output than this printer, which is supposed to have twice that resolution.

RGSULEXK1OHRB,"Ok. I don't really care about using certified toners only because of, as the printer manufacturers argue, the possible shortening of the life of the printer.

So why not just buy another printer I saved on using cheaper toners.That's why I gave it a go with this toner by PDS.But it didn't work.This might happened just to this one toner, and just me, as the general review score of this product is quite high.Regardless, what happened to me was that after using the new toner for about a week, I began to see some smudges on the printed papers, so I pulled the toner out and found out that it's been leaking.If the problem was just a somewhat 'cheap' looking, it would've been ok.But, this thing just didn't do the very basic job it's supposed to do -- to make where it has to be black black and white white.So now I'm going back to Brother's and going to stick to them.",0,0

R1T2PU3XH8OZU,"I was an early adopter of Neatreceipts when it was first introduced.  I was very excited about this product and it seemed to fill a niche we really had a need for. We spent a lot of time scanning in receipts.  Mostly, everything worked okay.  But eventually the cracks began to show and we started to look for a new solution.The first versions let you use a 3rd party scanner.  We have super-fast and sharp Fujitsu scanners at work.  They literally left the neatreceipts scanner in the dust.  Then with version 3, Neatreceipts disabled support for anything but their own scanner on the PC version, but mysteriously left it in the Mac version.  It was much slower and less accurate than the Fujitsu we had.  And as another reviewer mentioned earlier they abandoned the original format and promised a conversion utility to the new one.  With that confidence, many of us started using the new version and waited for the conversion utility to convert our old data. After several months they quietly said the utility was no longer in the works.Neatreceipts data is kept in a proprietary database.  It's not compatible, import-able, or readable by anything else... including earlier (and in some cases later) versions of the their own software.  We had one problem with a corrupted database, and after a phone call to tech support they said our data was toast from a bug they were working on, but so far had no fix for.  We did have a backup but lost the days' worth of receipts.This was sort of the final straw for us.  We concluded that important accounting info like receipts MUST be in a more universal format like PDF, or preferably PDF/a.  Also, the database needs to be something more universal like excel or a spreadsheet, where you can use the robust math functions of those programs to sort, search and sift through your data.  Neatreceipt's database engine seems bloated with lots of code for what it does.We finally said goodbye to NR after many years.  Our solution now is Filecenter - which scans and indexes quicker than NR, and stores all data in native Windows directories with the PDF/a format.  It's a much faster program than NR and slugs through many receipts and documents in minutes... especially with a fast scanner.  If you uninstall Filecenter, your data is safe and still all sorted in the directories.  It's a lean, mean program that gets the job done.I still miss NR - I loved they way it auto-populated some data from receipts.  But you still had to watch it as it was not completely accurate.  And even version 5 with the Neatdesk scanner is just too slow for business use for us.  Not only the scanning, but their sql database software seems bloated and chokes when you ask too much of it.  Even a super-fast computer doesn't seem to increase the speed of NR.  Not sure why?  I think the creators of NR were visionaries... I just wish they had evolved the product more.  Version 1.5 was the best.  Each new version was worse - and you can't downgrade after converting your data.  This seemed to be the general consensus on the support forums on their website.  (Neat recently deleted all of these user forums).",0,0

R2P88IPHQBSV79,"This is the 2nd BRAND compatible Toner I have purchased & received in this Month of August 2022.  I returned the other brand a week ago because the print quality was only FAIR and NOT Good compared to the existing toner cartridge that I was replacing it with.  The older toner cartridge was a compatible I purchased from Amazon in Sept of 2020 and it was still much crisper, darker and clearer than both the other  brand and this V4INK brand that I am writing about.  It seems to me that both recently received remanufactured toner cartridges (both are 2-pack) are being refilled with less quality toner material or maybe it's just LESS TONER in the cartridges.  Because of ""frustration"" I have decided to keep the V4INK cartridges rather than returning them as I did the other brand recently, just to try it out longer time to see if the print quality improves.  Amazon does stand behind these products, and I appreciate the quick response of a refund for the other brand this past week, but I am very disappointed to have the same thing happen with this 2nd choice compatible toner cartridge.

R1KJ059E0VSB50,"We ordered a Model 1103, as described above, because it claims to hold letter-sized paper flat. Honeywell, right? Reputable company, isn't it? The safe had over 1300 reviews, with a 4.5 overall rating! Wow! We just got it delivered today. Here are my immediate impressions. I strongly recommend reading them all before hitting that order button.The Good: This thing is built like a tank, and is remarkably heavy, but the outside and inside linings are almost entirely made of plastic. This is somehow not reassuring for fire resistance, but they claim it is. Should you trust them? Your decision. The latches seem very secure, and the lock would not be easily pried open.The bad: Here is the first head-scratcher:  When we put our will in, it bent slightly at the edges. (See photo for visual evidence.) I measured it, and the interior depth is 8 3/8 inches, a good 1/8 in. narrower than standard paper. Any idiot would say it should be probably 1/8 in. wider than the paper, so it's 1/4 in. too narrow.Why, I ask myself, would anyone deliberately build a tank that isn't quite big enough to correctly hold what it was designed to hold? I can't come up with any logical reason whatsoever. It seems like a small thing. Sure, you can put the papers in with a slight bend, but that reduces the effective capacity, as well as forcing your valuable papers to assume a permanent bend.I went back and looked at the description on the Amazon page. It gives two different external dimensions: At the top (notice these are direct quotes): ""Item Dimensions LxWxH 12.4 x 15.9 x 6.5 inches""In the About This Item section: ""The exterior Dimensions are 6.6 in H x 16.0 in w x 12.6 in D""OK, they're close, but this doesn't bode well for the veracity of anything else on the page, does it?More deviously, the only internal dimensions EVER mentioned anywhere on the page are way at the bottom, in the ""From the Manufacturer"" section (again, direct quote from the page): ""Interior Dimensions: 3.8""H x 14.8""W x 12""D "" Cool, 12 inches is far wider than standard paper, right?  Who would have noticed that this is for the 1104 model, not the 1103 that is being sold to us?THEN, I looked at reviews mentioning ""paper lies flat"", and found a stack of other Amazon reviews stating exactly the same thing, that the papers don't lie flat as claimed. Dumb me, I just trusted the star reviews on this one. I usually look at the comments. Never again will I not look at the comments.THEN, I read in the manual for our product that you have to open the safe for 30 minutes EVERY WEEK to let it air out, and they don't guarantee against interior moisture! I looked on the Amazon page again, and found more reviews about papers mildewing in the safe. Again, my bad for not reading this sooner. What the hell? How many people are going to put on their calendar every week to air out their document safe? Really?So, this really isn't a safe safe, after all, is it? You're trusting your most valuable, one of a kind documents to a box that can't even keep out moisture?What the hell, Honeywell?  You are lying through your teeth, selling us an undersized and poorly designed product. Since it is the Honeywell store selling it, the company clearly was aware.So, don't say you weren't warned.

R2JRA4A5DSL6DK,"When HP Printers work, they work really good. Quality-wise, they really are good with the printer output. It also just means the carts are pumping out a lot of ink fast! I am writing this review as a form of protest and fair warning to fellow consumers who have experienced or yet to experience the horrors and enraging frustration of having to fix and tweak faulty printers even for a mere one page printout task. I have had an HP8600 for some years and even bought a second one when the first one started going crazy on me. I can absolutely confirm that this was caused by the underhanded tactics of HP to release force-fed firmwares over the Internet (HP Printers are always connected now via router if you're on the net) that have led printers to disregard printer carts (whatever the source may have been, hand me downs, 3rd party carts, refills, donated carts, basically all carts outside of the retail carts supplied by HP, that contain the INK ALL USERS OF PRINTERS NEED. What else could printers be for but for printing? Actually, when the printer goes haywire due to the ""non malicious"" firmware upgrade (actually it's a profiteering racket that HP employed), you also lose the ability to scan documents!) I feel so violated that I can't even do what I want with the printer I bought with my own money! I didn't ask for that dumb firmware upgrade! Another sneaky way that an HP firmware upgrade does is it brightens out your control panel, so it's basically overbrightened and you can barely read anything on the digital keyboard panel, not unless you've mastered the keypad/letter placements. I have gone through 5 carts already and I've just wasted money on carts I can't use. My 2nd printer sort of exhibited a few symptoms and it's probably because I cross contaminated it with the carts that were exposed to the 1st printer's printhead. The ink carts' chips are basically embedded with data, obviously designed to ruin every HP printer owner's day because that's what HP seemingly wants, us to spend money on new printers and their ink!",0,0
RWRTX2XVUCAS8,"We have used Contico trunks for years and years. I still have a couple from 15 years ago or more that still work fine.In earlier years they were rigid plastic, never cracked and looked just like this photo. In the last 2 years or so, the quality has taken a big dive. The wheels are always broken off by the shipping company; the last one I bought for our crew had different latches that broke right off the first time we shipped the trunk. An associate bought one...latches broke off immediately. There is NO handle now and this is a big minus. We have never shipped without zip-tying through the lock holes and strapping around the trunks at both ends. Despite all attempts to improve results, these things now seem bent on self-destruction and I am looking at several that are only good for storage. I just took two relatively new ones to the town dump as they were so badly cracked they couldn't even be used for that.

R3H0YW1Q995HO0,"So I bought this pen because I draw a lot. I heard it has a super fine tip and does not smudge. It dries immediately and a highlighter could be used in seconds. And I found this to be true (and loved it!) However, the reason why I gave it a 2 star was because of its ink flow and the way the nib was made. I felt like the nib was scratching the surface of my paper (leaving little pen scratch marks) It wasn't as smooth and I could hear/feel the pen scraping the paper as I write and draw. Now I’m not sure if this was a defect on my order, but the two pens I got were definitely not good. In addition, the pen would clog up, and no ink would run through it as I write (this got really annoying). And once I cleaned the nib, the ink would continuously bleed (“explode”) and eventually clog up again (it was a never ending cycle).Overall, if this pen were to work properly (ex. Consisted ink flow and smoother nib) then I would rate this pen a 5star. But as of right now and the way it acts up for me. I do NOT recommend these pens to artists/heavy note takers that want to draw/write without ink flow issues and pen scratch marks.",0,0

They appeared to be the correct cartridges but they would not fit in the printer, they would not snap/latch closed and the printer would not detect them. While struggling to make them fit (i have changed the ink on this printer dozens of times with zero issue prior to this time so it is not user error), the brute force resulted in random bits and pieces breaking off my printer, so the entire thing was then deemed trash. We got a totally different style printer and I'll never deal with Lexmark again.. which is good since they seem to be out of business.

R1UZHG0TZGZ2XP,"Avoid; try Shoeboxed ([...]) with a scanner of your choice (I prefer flatbed). The sql database can be corrupted and rendered unusable by software or hardware crashes. Neat's solution for that is to provide a backup utility. Unfortunately, this backup of all data can take hours, and results in one very large file. As one other reviewer noted, such an extended procedure makes no sense for the home user that is just trying to add a few receipts and turn the computer off at night. Long and slow operations like this greatly increase the odds that the program will be interrupted by a crash. As another reviewer noted, its slowness makes it a bad choice for the business user as well. I didn't back up for a while; in my case, windows got corrupted and would not boot (don't know if the database was damaged). The partition can be read; all my wordprocessing, spreadsheet and pdf files can be opened; as far as this program goes, nothing. These problems seem inherent to sql; Neat may have chosen it to keep users dependent on them for data access. It would be a lot easier, faster, safer, and more appropriate for its intended non-server use to store pdf scans in folders and access them with a simple indexing program. Finally, my scanner went bad in about a year; it developed the streaks that some others have reported.",0,0

RCP531HIQNRHN,"BTW - Assuming you own Neat 5.0 software, you cannot purchase a scanner without a second purchase of the software!  Greta sales idea!UPDATE IS AT THE END OF THIS REVIEW as of 6-JAN-12I've spent over 8 hours running uninstalls/re-installs and registry cleans and under direction of two technical support representatives gone into file folder permissions and changed permissions and ownership - all installation issues that the reps acknowledge are failures in their installation script for Windows/7.  To put it bluntly, on a vanilla Windows/7 notebook, they are unable to have the product install without it crashing either instantly or after a few minutes of use.Great Idea - Terrible implementationIf you have Windows/7 - DON'T EVEN CONSIDER THIS PRODUCTNEAT is in violation of IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY -Why? IT DON'T WORK!Received NeatReceipts yesterday NeatReceipts Mobile Scanner and Digital Filing System Went to do install today, found that the installation CD was out of date (!) so downloaded the most currect version 5 software from Neat.com and installed without error.This is a Win/7 configuration Dell M1530Installed Neat handheld scannerStarted using the product - entered a few receipts to learn the filing and categorizing parameters.Walked away for a moment and on return found a popup error message:""Neat has stopped working"" and ""Windows is closing Neat because it has stopped working""Tried to reload and re-execute it - it loads momentarily into the task list and then abends/crashes almost immediately - same error messages.Did a complete re-install.Used for about 2 hours - loaded a number of receipts in to Neat - trashed the receipts - WRONG MOVE!Why?  went for dinner - came back to find Neat had abended/crashed again - back in same situation - no access to data entered - and the images cannot be accessed without Neat - non-standard storage method.Sent support inquiry to Neat.Got back a truly nonsensical response""Based on what you've asked, the following answers might be relevant.The following answers might help you immediately.Title: Connecting Your QuickBooks Company File to Neat 5Link: [...]Hmmm - I have never had Quickbooks.  Don't have Quickbooks,  Never said I hasd Quickbooks.It was never mentioned in the installation process.Never said anything about Quickbooks in the support inquiry.RESPONSE TO RON in the Neat Forum:Ron, and any one else reading,Yes, after several days including much time on the telephone, at least for my configuration, which is Windows/7 3gb memory, the problem was the install script being deficient in how it set file/folder permission.Before I go on, you may ask as you read the next sentence, why in heck does Neat 5.0SP2 required total administrative control of your machine, but I'll let you try to get the answer. The ""solution"" is go in to the folder properties for Neat located as follows:\Program Files\Common Files\NeatReceipts\Program Files\Neat\Program Data\The Neat Companyand the desktop shortcut for Neatand modify the properties of all folders and subfolders within, or the properties of the shortcut for security so that YOUR OWN SPECIFIC LOGON on this machine [as opposed to already Administrators, etc] has FULL CONTROL.The result then is the program works SO LONG AS YOUR MACHINE DOES NOT GO IN TO POWER STANDBY or SLEEP or worse! So you now have a working program as long as you remember to either keep the machine from going in to an idle state or you shut the program if you know you are going to walk away for a bitNow today I spent time on the phone with a nice young man in Philadelphia who explained to me that they had never heard of this problem before so there was no way for them to debug it. As for the obvious questions of why does the program so violate windows security and why is the install script not correct, your guess is as good as mine. So if you want to tell the nice young man that you too have experienced this supposed one-off error, use TICKET [Incident: 120101-000139].Best to all and to you Ron, good luck",0,0

R1M8NPD4SX1QJI,"Final Update: A lifetime of just 2 years.  Wow.I was somewhat impressed with Neat at first.  This little scanner filled a basic need, with several glitches and the occasional total software crash.  No big deal.  I suggested some improvements, but the software was never fixed.  Now, after owning one for just 2 years, Neat has shown why they had no interest in fixing or improving their product...The scanner software started crashing at startup.  It had done this on occasion, so I thought ""no big deal.""  When I went online to get support, I received a message that Neat no longer ""supports"" its devices and software; they just sell a monthly service.Neat got tired of working with ordinary 500% profit margins on $150 portable scanners, and decided they would also require a monthly fee.  This is where the real money is.  Sony and other companies have been coming around to the same truth.  I think they all learned it from the cell phone companies.  If you just bill a relatively small amount to a few million credit cards ($5-$50 per account, per month), you can make a fortune in return for absolutely nothing, and no one will protest because it seems like such a small amount each month.I guess some people like having all their finances and other personal information out there in the ""cloud,"" but I don't.  Besides, if you just want an online backup of your data, there are several free, secure alternatives.  I was already running Neatware with as little online interaction as possible, but I would never pay these crooks to mine my financial records!So, what I thought would be a lifetime (or at least long-term) $100 receipt scanner lasted about 2 years.  I will never buy another Neat product for as long as I live!1-Year Update: Had to drop it to 4 stars, because it is great, but it could be improved in many ways.Now, the hardware is very simple.  It's an open scanning cylinder in which the paper feeds straight through.  Because many (most?) receipts come from a ""roll"" of paper, and are sometimes folded or crinkled, they very often tend to exit the scanner and then loop back around to the feeder--causing a looping scan or a jam.  Barring that, receipts are often difficult to load.  This front-loading scanner is supposed to have a grab/preload function, but it only works about half the time.Most problems, however, are with the software.  First off, the OCR software is not great.  Receipts are often askew or printed poorly, and this accounts for some (but not all) of the problem.  There may only be one field that is incorrect on any given receipt (e.g. vendor, date, tax, total), but I am quite surprised on the unusual occasion that every field on a receipt is correct and the receipt is immediately ready to file.  Then, when you type in the correct info and go to another field, the corrections are not saved until you open another receipt or folder.  Problem is, I often correct the data and immediately drag the receipt into a folder--losing the corrections.  To keep from losing corrections, I have to click on another receipt, wait for it to load, then click back on the corrected receipt, then drag it to a folder.  This is a tedious waste of time.On the other hand, Neat is the only company that has these simple fields--which are just what I need.  This is still much easier than creating *and* filling appropriate fields in any other program.Second, and this may or may not be a problem for most folks, but we have several credit cards in our large family. Every time I scan a receipt, Neat seems to want to categorize the payment method as simply MC, Visa, Credit, or Debit.  I have created separate labels for, e.g., Visa ####, but Neat seems unable to learn this system--even though the numbers are printed on every receipt.Third, I started hitting a lot of bugs in the software after almost a year of use.  I looked up some tips on the web, and they worked for awhile, but Neat then started crashing every time I loaded it.  I eventually contacted customer support, who requested a log, and who gave me a 100% permanent fix.Since most shortfalls are in the software, it seems Neat could improve them if it really wanted to.  Problem is, with a hardware-based payment system, there is little to no motivation to improve the software.  I think all Neat really needs is some good old-fashioned competition.  There are plenty of great scanners out there, and there is some software that *can* manage receipts (e.g. Evernote), but no one else is really shooting specifically for the receipt-scanner market.  There are some companies now focusing on the smartphone-receipt-photo market, but I prefer the clean system of an actual scanner for my tax returns.Original Review: So I ordered the Fujitsu ScanSnap because of its great reviews.  It was a great little scanner, with a great range of functionality.  Only problem is, I needed a scanner for one very specific task--receipts.I have an awe-inspiring Brother scanner/copier/laser printer.  The resolution suits my needs, but what I really needed (badly) was a simple, reliable, and accurate hardware-software package for receipts.  It's so simple that it may seem corny, but Neat really does the job.I have a large family, and I've been wanting to scan all my receipts so I could claim our actual sales taxes.  Every time I want to scan a receipt, I just open the software, load the receipt, and hit scan.  The OCR is very good, and it has a certain amount of learning so it can recognize the vendor and format (tax, etc.).The scanner could be improved.  For one thing, the software shows up in Windows 8 and anti-virus programs as like 30 different programs and registry entries.  No big deal, it's just sloppy.  More importantly, if the computer has hibernated since you last used Neat, you will have to unplug and replug the scanner to get it to work.  I do it at the scanner, and I now know to do it while the software is loading.  So again, no big deal.  I also have not yet had to deal with a major software update and the reported losses of data, backward compatibility, or other problems.  But 6 months into the year and several hundred receipts into it, everything is peachy!",0,0

R1J9RG86MGHY5,"I bought this after trying the refill route and found the experience lacking.See my review of Brother toner refill item:  Brother TN-450 toner refill kit.While this works OK, it continually gives the indication of being low on toner(Low toner messages and flashing light on the printer, although the lights on the printer eventually goes  out.)Which almost seems to indicate it was refilled and (per the instructions of the toner refill kit)was not manually reset to show the cartridge to be full. (it's apparently a mechanical page count).So I'll eventually run out of toner, but still cheaper to go this route than a new Brother cartridge.PS 11/06/2013Tried a different TN-450 cartridge from another vendor, I couldn't get it to fit into the printer and work. Kept getting ""toner out"" messages and the ready light on the printer never came one.I'll be dropping back to the TN-420 from now on....",0,0
R2JI5G27SM5NGA,"This was my first fancy pen to own. Are used to write with jotters all the time. Since then, I have been riding a lot with fountain pens. I own a Waterman with a gold nib and a Conklin with a stainless steel nib. I would not recommend this pen because if it breaks, parker no longer services these. I had an issue with the cab not snapping on anymore and wanted it fixed. They said they couldn’t do anything and instead offered me a 50% discount on a new pen. Also, the ink is really expensive and does not last long. Last, I truly get a much better writing experience with a fountain pen. I will admit, it does look great and it will always be in my collection. This is my honest review. Hope this helps.",0,0

Amazon says contact Toner Tap, Toner Tap says contact Amazon... not good!!! The policy for returns or addressing defects is 30 days now (it was not this at the time of purchase) and since this has been an issue that only became obvious 30 days after it was purchased (most of that time was it sitting in a box waiting to be used as I try to keep a refill/spare handy when my current cartridges get low.Like others have reviewed, I started having trouble with the Yellow cartridge. At first I noticed that the yellow was uneven, heavier on the right side of the page, lighter on the left. This wasn't a nuisance or a huge problem as it did not take away from the overall print, but was noticeable with a close comparison. Now I am getting heavy yellow blotches on each side, about 1.5"" in width going down the page. This has now made my prints unusable and holding back production.

RVPHVBIF9MRYF,"This is the first product review I have ever written but I feel the Neat system is such a bad product and people need to be warned about it.  I purchased the Neat scanner in June 2013 as a simple solution to keep receipts.  I am not new to scanning -- I have owned an Epson commercial scanning system for several years.  While Epson is good for large documents, small receipts are cumbersome.  So the Neat system seemed to be a good solution.The Neat software began to have trouble sometime around 4 or 5 months of use.  Technical support is nearly non-existent and the technical support staff is not very knowledgeable.  At the end of 2013, or after 6 months worth of scanned receipts, I decided that the prudent thing to do would be to archive the data  and start 2014 fresh.  I followed the Neat instructions to archive the data and the software produced a nice archive file.  Problem solved, so I thought.  Last week, I tried to go into the archive to retrieve a receipt and guess what only about 20 receipts had been archived -- there should have been probably 200 or 300 or so.  OK, I thought I'll get the receipts from the Neat cloud back-up.  And guess what the receipts weren't there either.  After several online chats with Neat technical support (live agents are apparently not available for phone conversations), the online agent concluded that the system had malfunctioned and my data had been lost.  There had been no warnings or anything -- just lost data.  Let's hope I never get audited.I should add I am quite adept and capable in terms of computer and networking literacy and experience and I own new, high quality computers with up-to-date software which are the core of my small accounting business.  Fortunately my client data has been collected using the Epson system and that system has never malfunctioned in roughly 5 years.  I should have never trusted the Neat system.  Bottom line -- poor software, poor technical support -- do not purchase unless you want to lose your data.  Mine is going into the garbage dumpster.",0,0

R1LCEJD828MCZ1,"It's a wonderful concept but falls short in actual use. I have used this little desk with a 15"" laptop and a small mouse, always while sitting upright in bed with the stand over my legs. First, the pad area for use with a mouse is nice, plenty of room for even a full size mouse. I don't tilt my laptop more than about one notch but that too is handy -- there are several positions for you to tilt your laptop, iPad or book. I never had a problem with the laptop sliding over the edge but mine was never terribly upright. The teeny light is virtually useless -- not enough illumination to be able to see your keyboard. The little storage area is odd -- why did they design it to open from the front side of the table instead of the back? Not convenient at all if you are storing Post-its, flash drives, pens, etc. and want to retrieve something. The desk is very uncomfortable to use if you fold the legs under and use it as just a tray -- there's no padding or anything of the sort so you would need a blanket or pillow. We're talking hard plastic here, which makes the device fairly light in weight but you don't want it digging into your legs.Now, let's get to those lap-desk legs. This is what caused me to give it only two stars. They're okay in the shorter position while you're using it in bed, on a couch, chair, that kind of function. When the legs are extended out all the way they're very unstable and lack any kind of locking mechanism. So what, you might say. I always store my laptop on this desk with the legs fully extended and it stays on the floor between uses. I can't tell you how often I've moved or picked it up to vacuum, shove it aside or just pick it up to use it -- and one or both of the legs folded inward and my laptop slid off the side. Gaaa! For the past year I've been thinking I was doing something wrong, it must be that I'm not smart enough to figure out how to lock the legs in place. No, now that I've decided to give this thing away I can see it's a design flaw and I should have smacked myself in the head after the first collapse of the legs, watching my expensive new laptop slide off. Ah well, live and learn.There are many more choices of lap desks out there, I wouldn't bother with this one. Save your money and find one that's rated higher and constructed better.",0,0

R13ZEPOXZINCYV,"I've been using Neat Receipts for a while now and have found it to be a decent product. A nice side benefit of their portable scanner was that I could use it without the software for other scanning tasks.I recently bought another laptop running Win 7 and did a search to find the driver for it. Imagine my chagrin when I couldn't find one. However, chagrin turned to outright anger once I discovered that the reason I couldn't find a new driver is that Neat Co. is charging another $30 for the ""privilege"" of getting a Win 7 compliant driver that will allow me to continue using their scanner with Neat software....or anything else.So if you're planning on buying this or any other Neat product, make sure you budget for the cost of buying new drivers whenever Neat Co. needs a boost to their bottom line. Sure there's nothing that requires a company to provide a new driver....well, other than a sense of decency, a lack of outright corporate greed, and perhaps a class action lawsuit.By the time one of their reps shows up with a slick response to this review, I'll already have a new scanner and will have started the process of archiving and/or re-scanning all my data as I refuse to give my money to a company that operates this way.Buh Bye Neat Co.",0,0

R17FUN23M5D05T,"I give this calculator two stars because it has a lot of functionality.  It is mostly a time sink and a source of frustration.Pros:1. This is a capable machine.  It can do a lot.  Much more than I ever want a calculator to do, actually.2. Hi-res screen.  The high resolution is nice.Cons:1.  The keyboard is terrible.  The keyboard on TI's earlier calculators were bad, and this one is actually worse.  TI needs to take a lesson from HP on how to make keys that don't wobble around and that provide some decent tactile feedback.  The keys, all of them, are squishy and wobbly.  The extra crowding by the letter keys makes it incredibly difficult to type anything, numbers or letters, without hitting the wrong key.  It is a constant source of frustration as well as a waste of time.2.  The learning curve it too high.  If I use this in class, I will need to take considerable time (a few days) just teaching the students how to use it.  This is time that then cannot be spent teaching math and physics.  Which should I teach my students, Newton's Laws of Motion, or how to click ""Menu...Action...Pointer...""3.  Doing simple tasks is now difficult.  Turn it on, wait for the operating system to load, then click Home, then 1:calculator, then Enter, and then you can finally type 2+2 and get an answer.4.  The screen, while it is hi-res, is not all that easy to read.  It gets a good bit of glare.5.  My students don't like it.  With the TI-83, I would at least get a lot of ""Oh, that's cool"" comments when a nice graph would appear.  When one of my poor students finally accomplishes a task on the nSpire, there is instead a sense of relief that they finally got it do what they were trying to do.  This calculator is not enjoyable to use.6.  The calculator is bulky.

R18QA48V0Q312U,"I've owned the Charles Leonard pencil sharpener (model #89508)for six months. After reading many reviews and searching the web for an economical and functional rotary pencil sharpener I took the plunge and bought this sharpener. And then wanted to return it.First flaw, the mounting screws are useless. I knew this going into the purchase and thought a trip to the hardware store would make for an easy fix. Now I ask, why should I do the work that is the MANUFACTURER's responsibility?? It's still not mounted. I've many other things I need to do and doing somebody else's job isn't among them.Second flaw, because it is unmounted (still) one person has to hold the sharpener firmly down so another person can sharpen the pencil. Typically somebody knocks off the cover...frequently...because it just does NOT stay on...and it ain't goin' back on in a hurry! The cover just does NOT go back on in the up/down position (as shown in the picture). Mine has dents from forcing it back into position.If it were sideways mounted(HA!)then presto, no problemo, the cover easily goes on sideways. EVERY time a pencil is sharpened the cover comes off and pencil grindings are everywhere...again!!Third flaw, yes the sharpener has eight holes for differing sizes of pencils. One hole is helpfully marked STANDARD to show where standard-sized pencils ought to fit. I'm not sure which country the Standard is set but it isn't the U.S. since my average #2 U.S. school pencils don't fit in the standard slot.For that matter, my child's oversized pencil fits in the largest oversized hole but the burr doesn't touch the pencil. What's the point of offering eight sizes if the largest holes are just for appearance not function?Lastly, sometime recently it began only sharpening effectively in one direction. And not in the comfortable direction but the awkward one (remember it takes two people to run it). When the sharpener was new the burr mostly cut the pencils on all sides so maybe it was worth a little effort. Now it only shaves one side. The tip is long and sharp...and breaks often so that now I'm back where I began: looking on Amazon for a functioning rotary pencil sharpener.In the immortal words of my child: ""The thing's a ripoff"".",0,0

I tried to get the piece to rejoin the others, but he refused.  ""Why do you hate me so?""  I just wanted my wife's stapler to work.  ""I'm not lazy, I am not up to the job, I can staple one page, maybe two.""I replied ""I don't really need to staple 1 page documents, those would be placed in a folder by themselves.

R3RUM3Y1RF353G,"Buyer beware!  This toner cartridge gives extremely poor yield and, therefore, is a poor value.I purchased this toner cartridge for a Brother DCP-7065DN printer.  The original Brother “starter” cartridge lasted for slightly more than 1000 pages, although the last 200 or so pages were after the “low toner” message had started.  The replacement cartridge worked fine for approximately 800 pages.  Then, the print quality suddenly deteriorated very badly.  There was no “low toner” warning message;  there was just the deterioration in print quality.  The print quality problem was exactly like that shown on page 63 of the printer’s “Basic User’s Guide.”  It was typical of the fading-out that occurs when a cartridge is running out of toner.  (This was clearly NOT a print-quality problem related to cleaning, e.g., it was NOT the type of problem in which specks or lines appear.)Unfortunately, I had bought another of these cartridges because the first one was initially giving good copies.  Because of the poor print quality, I ended up switching out to the second cartridge before I had reached 1000 copies on the first cartridge.  In other words, a cartridge that was supposed to give me 2600 copies lasted for fewer printed pages than the original Brother starter cartridge.  The second cartridge is currently giving good copies (just like the first one).  It remains to be seen how long this cartridge will last.UPDATE  on 08/19/15:  The second cartridge is now running out of toner and giving poor copies.  I got less than 1200 pages!  Both times there was no ""toner low"" warning, so now I have to act quickly to buy a new toner cartridge, but certainly never again from Shop at 247.  I wish that I could give a negative number of stars to this ripoff product and ripoff company.  Please do NOT buy anything from Shop at 247!",1,1
R1WHELNTG8ZMK1,"This should be a zero rating. It appears that poor quality control renders item useless as an adjustable stool.The best two things that can be said are: (1) that it works as a single height stool; (2) customer service answers emails promptly.The stool arrived in good condition. There are slightly different versions of the assembly instructions - one online and one with the kit.  This causes confusion.  A critical piece of information is missing from both: the orange cap  is not removed.  The illustration of which cap to remove is not to scale and appears to indicate the orange cap on the piston.In this case, the cylinder piston was inoperative. The company sent another without argument.  It arrived 7 or more days later  which defeats the purpose of having Amazon Prime for speedy delivery.Taking apart a forcefit assembly requires muscle, padding, and a non-marrying mallet.  You can add $25 to $45 dollars to the cost for a good mallet unless you think the company will accept a dented return.The second cylinder worked but only after another round of assembly and disassembly.  Sitting and bouncing on the chair did not activate the piston as per the optimistic instructions. A sound wack on the orange cap  with the mallet did.Still, the stool did not work. A final disassembly found that the weld for the seat adjusting lever was crooked.  It did not make contact with the piston.  No easy fix.Customer service has not been contacted about the second quality control failure.  If they read this and want to send another seat assembly I'll edit the rating.  It's not worth the time, effort, or expense to go through another round of emails or to box up the unit and send it back.Seriously considering giving the stool a Viking funeral then have an artist friend render the remains with company logo and address into an art piece for the local gallery.",1,1

RRYXVRN3WEY7Z,"I should have listened to the reviews and steered clear of these but of course I had to learn everything else in life the hard way so it’s only fitting that be the case with these as well.To begin with, I opened the case to find pens with all sorts of different amounts of ink levels which is always a red flag but was especially concerning and disappointing because some were nearly empty and I do mean empty. I have emptied enough gel pens to know that this isn’t something that happens easily or by accident. Maybe if the pen was nearly empty AND there was a bunch of ink leaked all in the cap and case but that’s not at all what went on with my set. The cap and the case were both clean. The different various ink levels along with the fact that when I emailed the seller and requested a replacement set and was instead given a refund and told that there were no more sets tells me that I almost certainly received a used set that had been returned after quite a bit of use.I assume the reason it was returned was not due to the levels of ink though. I imagine that the original owner received a pretty even batch and that the ink amount changed as they used the pens. The reason I imagine they probably returned these was because, quite frankly, they aren’t very good pens. I could be wrong because I got a used set and maybe the previous owner left the caps off or something but all of the pens were mostly dry and barely flowed. The ones that did flow would skip a lot and were frustratingly unreliable. To top it off the colors were not very vibrant or anything special. The ink did dry quickly, I will give it that. Also there is a good variety of textures as this set has neon, metallic, and glitter. Out of the entire set I really liked the color of four of them and of those four, two were dried up, one was empty and the other worked.These pens are so thin that I can’t imagine getting much use out of them for coloring anyway even if they did work. They barely contain much ink at all. I definitely really liked the feel of the skinnier pens in my hand though as I have pretty tiny hands though so that may be why. The difference in feel though does not outweigh the negatives however and I’d take a fatter pen between my fingers for longer lasting, reliable ink flow, cheaper price, and better color selection any day. The case was nice and hard and latched solidly and I thought that was a great change from the usual folding, cheap, annoying, plastic things that most gel pens come in but unfortunately the pens were super hard to get out of it and I felt like I was going to snap a pen in half trying to get it out or put it in.Bottom line: Do not buy these! Look elsewhere on Amazon because they have some amazing sets with 100 beautiful colors, comfort grips, perfect flow, and refills for almost half of what these cost. Check out Aen, ColorTechnik, Amazapens, and GelWriters right here on Amazon for some high quality and reliable gel pens!",0,0

Those shipping labels were the best ""off brand"" labels I ever used, and were nice and thick so that I could run them through the printer twice when needed.

I don't have this peeling problems with the Dymo or Brother brand labels I've used in various label printers.Edit: In reponse to the comment noting that these are meant to be removeable labels- I did overlook that when I originally purchased them. That does make a difference. However, I'm leaving my review at 2 stars because I think they also fail as removeable labels. These are ""too removable"" and simply would not stay on the items. They kept peeling off after a few days, and lasted an even shorter time for items that were not perfectly flat. Amazon uses labels that are removeable yet actually stay on the item when you want them to, so I imagine that House Labels could improve these with a slight change in their adhesive formula.",0,0

RS5U3U361PH4H,"****3days later Edit****Oh man I hate to admit it but this thing really let us down. The cup holder netting and ring broke off literally an hour after I left the first review. I was able to fix it but now the little drawer it sits on won’t shut. The legs not being individually adjustable really turned out to be a bigger deal than I thought it would be. Here’s why: the pop up top is actually pretty heavy. And when you have it raised, it makes the whole thing want to fall toward you. Being able to adjust those legs to make them longer under that side, would balance that. But instead it just falls in your lap. Spilled the drink all over the place. Another thing is: when the top is raised for propping your device, the crease between the raised part and flat part pinches and scratches the crap out of you. Finally, the little pedestal won’t stay in either designated place, the little pegs are just too short.It’s a real bummer too because my kid really loves the tray. I noticed the problems on the second day but she begged me to keep it because she loves the anchor stamp and how beautiful the whole thing is. And I do too. But I’m afraid I’m going to have to return it. I even thought I would keep it and get her something different but it does the exact same thing to me. I’ll be contacting the seller ASAP because I’ve already thrown away the box.First, I want to say that this tray is BEAUTIFUL craftsmanship. I’m so impressed with it! It’s solid! Sturdy, smooth and absolutely perfect. I ordered it for my special needs daughter who needs it for her iPad. The only issue I have is her iPad case makes it a little too bulky to prop on the pedestal, which was my reason for getting the tray. That’s the cases fault, not the tray. But it would be an improvement to make that pedestal a little bigger to hold a bulky device. Also, as you can see in the photo, I had to put a pillow under the tray to stop it from falling forward on her. Adjusting the legs didn’t help prevent this. I think if you would make each leg individually adjustable, so that I could level it against her weight and pull on it, it would fit her needs better. And, if you do indeed decide to make that improvement, I will keep this one and buy her another one. Because we really love it!! But for now I’m going to use Velcro to help hold her iPad and I’ll continue using the pillow for her lap. Thank you for such a beautiful piece. My daughter especially loves the cup holder.",0,0

It's a no-brainer for me, I'm done wasting money on HP's ridiculously overpriced cartridges.Update July 2017:It took a while for me to get what I paid for, but the day finally came. I guess it's true, If something seems to good to be true, it probably is. After months of use, these cartridges have failed spectacularly. While ink levels remain good, the quality of printing is disastrous. Streaking, bleeding, gobs of black ink on my documents, and now an error message on my printer, which might be permanently damaged from these cheap cartridges. I'm not even attempting to print photos, just standard documents with basic colors. They come out dark and hideous looking, and the black ink is also bleeding onto the paper on the sides.I hope these didn't destroy my printer, but it's back to genuine HP for me. It's just not worth it. Don't buy these under any circumstances!",0,0
R3CJE5MHCHEMOX,"I would give it less than one star if I could. Completely useless after one use, one task which it did not even complete. Washing it does not restore it to new, and even if it did, right out of the box it was crappy. A regular tape roller is much quicker and more efficient and most importantly, does the job. Save your money and pass on this one.",1,1
R1WQBHRCVPZJF1,"Things were off to a rocky start when I didn't know exactly how I was supposed to even start putting it together. It tells you to ""Attach both legs to the tray by inserting them into the holes from the outer side until it clicks"". ...What? I gave them the benefit of the doubt and went right to it, only to realize I started it wrong. I had a 50/50 shot lol. What they SHOULD say is for you to make sure that their logo is right side up, facing the direction of the top of the tray. Was that so hard to explain?Because I put it on incorrectly, I had to pull the legs back out, and this was REALLY HARD. It felt like I was going to break it. I couldn't proceed with how I had it, because inserted incorrectly, the screw holes weren't aligned properly. I read a previous review that mentioned they weren't predrilled...it sounds like this person didn't insert the legs correctly. They also mentioned that the degrees didn't match up...this is also likely why.My biggest gripe is how much of an absolute pain the legs are to adjust, which is its main feature. You really have to shove your thumb into the hard plastic button to get it to rotate. This is really awkward for me, especially because I'm currently going through physical therapy for my wrist. Whenever I think things are going kind of well with it, I get stuck trying to rotate it because the legs are misaligned, and want to just throw the whole thing in the trash.I purchased this because I figured it was more convenient to have something that is easy to fold up and put away, than to replace my entire desktop with a large standing desk. This is absolutely not that thing lol. I pretty much never want to adjust the legs because of how painful wrestling with them is. It's fine if you never have to adjust it.Not recommended.",0,0

RXNCQ92XQXANM,"Tragic.Roaring Spring does zero justice for Whitelines. Please make the original Swedish-made products available for purchase in the US again!!!! I would gladly pay so much more just to be able to buy those again or guess I’ll have to go to Sweden.Purchased these about a month ago despite reviews of lower quality - I said eff it I don’t know what else to use so I’ll just get these and see how it goes. I’m writing this review now because I am SO OVER these stupid spiral holes that are literally just open at the top.I think the only thing I actually like about these Roaring Spring versions are the stiff, cardboard backs. Otherwise everything is worse, ALSO cheap looking. The pressure from my Muji pen shows up on the other side and the spiral holes are atrocious, with the top hole being cut so unevenly it’s actually just open.  Now the only differences between this and every other sh*tty notebook out there are the actual Whitelines/paper color (I really don’t mind the greyish shade) and the paper is like...A TOUCH heavier than standard paper.I miss the slimmer spiral, the A4 size, the beautiful matte white soft touch covers, and the heavy paper of the original Swedish books. The amazing quality made me more thoughtful of what I wrote on the page as I didn’t want to waste any of the beautiful space. Glad I stocked up on perspective paper and grid notebooks before we got stuck with Roaring Spring’s sad sad excuse.You should probably not buy these if you’re used to the much superior original Whitelines products, I know I wanna cry about it every time I write in them.",0,0
R29SARGRGVTVIA,"I bought this product because of having fan and being almost of the same price as other. But this product is very badly manufactured. The fan is working but all the screws are loose and cannot be tightened. The whole fan box is shaking and obviously it will detach sooner or later.All the joints are loose and the whole structure is shaking. Specially, if you set it in the highest situation, it is not at all reliable and you cannot leave your laptop on.I don't know how good or bad are other products either but my point is that if you wanna give it a try, start from other products because I did and I am definitely returning this and I will buy one of others that has at least many customer reviews.",0,0

I put the old black back in and no problems!Then.....The yellow and magenta began to smear on prints after 10 printouts. Since I had bought these a month ahead of time preparing for my need to change cartridges.Update August 8:  Global toner customer service has contacted me and has offered a refund or replacement.

R1VXSD0Q6RNWZC,"I've now installed two sets of these in an HP Photosmart 7510.As mentioned in other reviews, you have to mess with the printer quite a bit to even get it to recognize that there are cartridges installed.  After a few hard resets (unplug the printer, plug it back in), and forcing a cartridge cleaning, it found the cartridges.  However, the printer would give an error when you asked it to do a print head alignment, so it's not possible to do a print head alignment.  The cartridges are also super-leaky.  Wear latex gloves and watch out for your clothes.I think because of that, the print quality was poor, and had lines in it.  I still kept using the cartridges, though, until the Magenta cartridge died after about 50 pages.  I had a spare from the same company, but that one the printer wouldn't recognize at all, even after trying to reset the printer three times.  I gave up and put my old, depleted HP cartridges back in the printer, and although the printer complained that it was low on ink, it still was able to print for me, so I know my printer and the setup is working.I went ahead and check the rest of the second set, and about half of them are dead, at least on the first try.At this point, I give up on these cartridges.  They're super cheap, and I might get them to work eventually, but there are other inexpensive HP-compatible cartridges out there that work the first time, every time, and have great print quality.Also, since the manufacturer expects you to pay return shipping, if you do have to return these cartridges, you're out the shipping charges both ways, which is about the same as the whole pack of cartridges costs.  So you can't really even get your money back.",0,0

Not sure if this was just my batch but I don't think I'll be buying these again. The issues started with the ink flow -- these things skip constantly during writing, now don't get me wrong these pens are very precise, but the ink flow is incredibly poor, if you are not holding them at the right angle or forcing the ink down yourself, it constantly skips, which in my opinion makes these just not worth buying.

I ordered new cartridges from a different seller.There is a reason the seller only guarantees their cartridges for 30 days.Original review:  This is my first order from this seller. I have been using these toner cartridges for almost a month. So far I am impressed with the print quality. My canon MF731cdw immediately recognized the cartridges.

R14VJ9O8QJL3C3,"I purchased the Large, 30 Liter (Model 1108) Safe and was incredibly disappointed. First and foremost you will notice that it is incredibly heavy. 82 Lbs. My fault for not thoroughly reviewing specs before purchasing. After my initial shock at the weight I thought it would be ok since this is going to be on the floor in a closet anyway. Inspecting it further and playing around with the locking mechanisms is the another reason behind my disappointment. The gold/beige clips that hold the lid down are shockingly flimsy and felt like the would break immediately. As a result they are pretty much useless for securing/keeping the lid closed. The next issue was the locking mechanism: it felt cheap and flimsy, they keys barely worked (you had to carefully wiggle the key into the lock to get it to work, I was also afraid I would accidentally break it).Finally the last issue (and the main reason for buying such a safe): Hanging folders. The safe is ever so slightly narrower in the middle, there is a very fine and slight bulge (presumably due to the insulation) but it is just enough for the hanging folders to catch the side and get stuck/fall off the side 'rails'. The ultimate deal breaker was that once you have some hanging folders in the safe you cannot close the lid because there is not enough 'head room' in the lid of the safe. What a complete waste of time and money.Returning this awful product.",0,0

I need them to have a very sharp, pointed tip so I set it to the third setting for just such results but not only did it sound like it was eating the pencil, the very sharp tip I wanted is on one side only. My manual sharpeners can't adequately sharpen the unsharpened VeriThins, so now I cannot use them though I need them for the work I'm doing.  Way too much aggravation.

R2I6L7BHZE8ZB9,"I normally don't bother with reviews but if writing this review helps someone else then great.I've watched the Neat commercials for a very long time now and have always been skeptical of their claims.  I'm in need of a portable solution for receipts and business cards being that I travel nearly everyday.  I figured I'd take a chance and get lucky so I ordered the Neat Receipt for Mac.  I was a little surprised to see that both Mac and Windows software wasn't provided since the hardware should be the same.  Long story short...this product just doesn't work.  It scans ok but it will transpose numbers or totally miss it all together.  I had one receipt that was $1.87 and it read it as $1007.00.  It is of little use if every single entry has to be edited with the document type, amount and vendor name.  It was no more useful than taking a picture with my phone and submitting my expenses report that a way.To be fair...I did scanner without destroying the paper documents and the scan capture was fine but all the organizational claims are none existent.  You don't have to believe my review, just buy it, try it and you can return it like me.",0,0

R3FT89GWVUL5NL,I just received this item today. I bought it for my son who games on a pc from his bed and would place the keyboard on his lap. As far as the intended use goes this does precisely what it was purchased for. That's enough to get 2 stars. The manufacturing quality of this item is absolutely terrible. The holes in the tubes have heavy burrs that will cut your fingers. The wood panels were riddled with chips along the edges. And the screws are not efficiently guided by the holes they pass through which significantly compromises strength and durability. I don't have high hopes for the longevity of this item. Buyer discretion is highly advised.,0,0
R142XN2GV3CVBK,"I bought these because of all of the positive reviews, but in my case that was a mistake. I can only comment on the replacement cartridges for the Epson XP-600 -- they're mostly useless. The large black cartridge works all right and, once installed and after clicking through all of the warnings about how they're not genuine Epson cartridges, the software recognizes all of them and shows the ink levels. However, the color cartridges do not print dependably. Different colors print at different times but never all at the same time. I followed the troubleshooting instructions, which say to clean the print heads 3 times (this, by the way, uses about half of the ink in a new cartridge) and waiting 24 hours, and the results were actually worse. I think the genuine Epson cartridges are vastly overpriced, but they do work, so I suppose I'll keep buying them. If it weren't that I need a printer that prints on CDs I'd probably buy a different brand, but I do so I'm stuck.",0,0

R1WV7ITRP7XSZX,I am very disappointed with this product. I ordered this after reading quite a few good reviews. I was happy at the time that I had picked a good replacement cartridge for my printer. I was wrong.The first thing I ran into was while opening the magenta cartridge to put it in the printer is that it leaked all over my hand. ( I now have pink fingers.) Then as I was about to put in the cartridge I noticed that the tab on the front was broken off. The cartridges can't be installed without the tabs. The second magenta went without incident. Then I moved on to the Cyan cartridges. I found that both of them had the tabs broken off. To make a long story short. I found broken tabs on one yellow and one small black cartridge also. I also ran into leaking ink with the large black cartridge.So in conclusion almost 50% of the ink I purchased is useless. My fingers are now stained black and pink. I am attaching pictures so you can see what I am talking about. I am returning the cartridges and I do not recommend them.,0,0

R2N0SVW24E89R7,"I am a big fan of Jatstream pens, and I am writing this review to say that this BLX line of Jetstream RT's do not live up to the good name that Jetstream has earned for its superior performance over the years. My main reason for this is at the core of what pens do - make lines. I was consistently disappointed with these pen's ability to pull consistent solid lines at any speed, slow or fast. Now, I use these for writing more than drawing straight lines, and I can say that I have stopped using them for the same reason - inconsistent ink to paper.(I actually took a Jetstream BLK RT and an original blue Jetstream RT side-by-side, and the blue was consistently MUCH more reliable than the BLK, and any speed and for any line.)I may have purchased a bad batch, but at this time I cannot recommend these Jetstreams to anyone, and I will stick to my classic Black and Blue Jetstream RTs (Which are great!)",0,0

One of my scanners has a fault. Each and every time I have reached out to them, I get back the same link to the same web page telling me how to clean the scanner. Even if I mention in the ticket that I ALREADY cleaned the scanner. The warranty for the scanner is not worth the paper it is written on (or the electrons you scanned it into).

There was no burning smell as stated on some reviews for similar low cost replacement option for the Epson 8350 projector. 2 star rating is only because the picture is just not as good by a wide margin compared to the original bulb.  I can barely watch during the day which was never a problem before.  I have to keep the lights off and watch at night and then the picture is just ok......3 stars in those conditions.  I'm going to double check if there is any alignment procedure I'm not aware of when installing the bulb.  The bulb unit went in so easy and there are only 2 screws....didn't seem like there was any option to make an adjustment forward or backward in positioning.  I will research this and update the rating if anything changes.  Total use is about 1.5 weeks and around 40 hours.  If no better results, I will either return or hold on to this one as a backup to use in between bulb replacements using an original from Epson.  The original bulb must really make the difference in the great picture we had.  I have owned the Epson 8350 for almost 2 years and the original bulb lasted 2,300 hours.

My wife says one star and only because ""zero stars"" is not an option.  My wife is not an overly critical person by nature but her contempt for this model sharpener has no bounds.  She can't get it to work.  She tries gently sticking in the pencil, she tries it forcefully, she tries twisting the pencil as she inserts it...nada, zilch, nothing.  For a while she found that unpluging the power adapter from the unit would cause the sharpner to spring into action, but sadly, no more.  My interactions with the device have been a little better.  I found that if I had a positive attitude when using it, I got better results.  I would say a few encouraging words and I could get one or two pencils sharpened before the thing would refuse to service me anymore.  But if I waited 10 or 20 minutes and came back with some more sweet words of kindness, I could tweak out another sharperning, but really, who has that kind of time.  Trying to get through a pack of 20 pencils for your kids' school supplies on a Sunday night can take the better part of the evening if my patience persists and meanwhile my wife is in the other word calling the machine names that I cannot repeat here.

R2763TO0VJEOLB,"While these labels (and numerous similar ones in other sizes) are very useful around the house, a design change in the last year or two has added a fatal flaw. Previously, the labels had an overprinted border so you could see where the label stopped and the background paper started. Now, probably;as a cost-cutting measure, the individual labels no longer have a printed border. As a result, it's very difficult to tell whether you're writing on the label or the background paper. I've wasted I don't know how many labels by going off the label and writing on the background. It helps to fold the label along the border edges  so you can see where the label stops, but even this doesn't always solve the problem. It's really too bad, because the older labels really deserved five stars, but without the printed border, the labels are much more difficult to use, imho.

R183J2XL4783KN,"I bought the HP ""3 ink cartridge"" in July 2020.  I did not need the magenta cartridge until October 2020 (I had previously used the cyan and yellow cartridges and they worked normally).  The product expiration date is 01/2022.  At first I could not get the cartridge to work at all, even after re-seating it numerous times.  I called Amazon customer support and was informed that their warranty is for 30 days, but that HP would cover the warranty.  I called HP customer support and was told that they do not warranty ink cartridges that are not sold by HP, and that Amazon is responsible.  I called back Amazon.  Of course when I re-seated the cartridge again while on the phone call, my printer 'recognized' it and I was able to print.  The color is not normal, but it is 'red'.  So at that point I dropped the issue with Amazon, who was nothing but helpful.  This review is to let you know that if you buy HP ink on Amazon and do not try ALL the cartridges within 30 days, and try to get satisfaction from HP, they will NOT cover the warranty even though it is a genuine HP product sold by Amazon.  I did end up buying, 1-day delivery, an 'off-brand' set of ink cartridges from Amazon (manufacturer: iKong) so that my printer would at least print (it will not print at all unless ALL the cartridges are full enough) while I was awaiting an outcome on the HP ink cartridge, which I could NOT get in 1-day.  Well, the iKong cartridges print in non-smeary, nice color and the 3 cartrige colors were about 1/3 of the price the HP cartridges were.  So guess what?  I will NEVER buy HP ink refil cartridges again, as they do NOT stand behind their product.",0,0

I followed the instructions that came with it, on what to do in such an event, but it did not help.  The price seemed too good to be true and apparently it is. UPDATE - they sent me replacement cartridges for free after just a few days, so great customer service, I'm giving them another star for that. Apparently the chips on the cartridges needed updating.  I'll update again once I see if they work properly. UPDATE 2 - These $18 cartridges have now cost me $350. To their credit, the company sent me a new set within a couple of days, but I needed to get some printing done immediately so I bought a proper OEM set of cartridges.  Within a few pages the Cyan started printing very streaky.  I have done all of the resets, cleanings and alignments several times but I think the ink from the Fuzoo cartridges clogged the print head.  The new print head is about $120.  A new printer is $129.  Of course the updated version of the exact same printer takes different ink cartridges, so I had to buy a set of those at $110.  So I spent $250 for the new printer and ink, plus $100 for the new OEM cartridges that are still brand new and full in the now useless printer. You could say I am not pleased with my experience. Since you can not give 0 stars, I will give the minimum 1 star, that's for their customer service.

R14IGE03J7R06X,"I have been using the neat receipts software and scanner combo for approximately two years now, and I just can't recommend it. The software is clumsy, and makes you wonder how this can be considered a productivity tool.The while you can scan at a reasonable pace (I have no issue with the scanner), the scanned receipts pile up in the cue (my computer is reasonably well resourced and reasonably new).The character recognition software is weak enough that vendors are rarely identified, total amounts are frequently incorrect, and dates are frequently wrong.While reviewing and correcting your receipts, it does not appear that you can always navigate where you need to go using the keyboard. Plus, when using the mouse, repeated clicks are required in most fields to gain focus for editing. The software appears to try to maintain your sort order (ok, a good thing), but when you are editing the field on which you are sorted, the row will move to its properly sorted order, and you all of the sudden find yourself viewing and editing a different receipt (not so good).

R2EIQD92L50M1,"Took a chance and purchased this toner based on reviews. My mistake was waiting until my real Samsung toner ran out to try these toner cartridges.

It was the same with both cartridges. sometimes it prints fine, other times it doesn't. Either having the low toner light come on or the orange power light comes on.",0,0

R1R7TZ38DU2KIK,"To start out, I'm as planner addict, and have used planners for years once I was introduced to them in the Navy. I've always used Erin Condren and (my BIG ideas) Happy Planners and have LOVED them. I was tired of spending the money on the bug name brands, so I gave this Law of Attraction a try and am pretty disappointed, in all honest. This ""planner"" is half made up of self-help mantras and the other half is a poorly executed planner. After you wade through 20ish pages of this ""self help and self growth"" charts/quizes/whatever, you finally get to start your planner...the month layout starts on a Monday, which I wasnt used to with standard planners, so it's been a bit of a battle trying to remember that when filling out. Also, the days are broken down into lines of ""hours"" instead of a larger box so that you arent cemented with documenting everything you do at every hour.If you are looking for some kind of self help and self growth oddly thrown together planner, then this is for you.If you are ACTUALLY looking for a planner to keep track of things/remjnders/events etc, this is totally not for you.Star for being cute and stylish but the cover with the odd mantras feels childish.",0,0

R3S55U5PYKTJB7,"CEASED PRINTING AFTER JUST A FEW MONTHS - Print head was clogged just a few short months into the life of this printer.  I didn't know what the problem was though so I bought new XL cartridges thinking it needed new ink and of course it still would not print.  The 5690 printed very poor quality pages for a few months before never working again.  Unfortunately I bought this when it was 369 USD, whereas now I see them for 210 USD.  I used the cleaning feature to no avail and even hired a computer technician who told me it might be a loss!  Because of the hundreds of dollars already spent on this printer itself and on two sets of XL cartridges, am going to try the home cleaning kit as a last resort.  I can't believe it came highly rated in Consumer Reports, which is what prompted me to spend 369 on an inkjet printer in the first place.  Also, even in its short life when it was printing shoddy pages of text, it was VERY difficult to connect to any device via wi-fi and required turing the wi-fi off and on.  Even tech savvy visitors became so frustrated in trying to get the connection to work.  Terrible experience and such a great loss financially.",0,0

I write books for my grandkids and print and bind a copy for each of 10 kids.The first cartridge is put in, ran for about half a book and then printed everything in light blue, possibly using my blue color cartridge to do so.  Since the books are printed in bookfold I had to hand feed almost an entire book on both sides of the paper to make up for the bad cartridge.  I replaced it with the other black cartridge and so far it seems to be doing fine.The odd thing is that i can hear the ink sloshing in the cartridge when i shake it, but it doesn't deliver.  i removed the tape and the cartridge worked for a little while and then just quit.So my review is going to be mixed.

R3H6OLYULMEYV1,"Update: After this cheap ink clogged up my Canon iP100 printer, I tried everything but there was only one fix that actually worked.  I removed the cartridges and print head, and soaked the print head in cups alternating with Windex (or ammonia) and Reverse Osmosis (or distilled) water.  I soaked it for a few hours until all the ink was out of the print head.  I removed the thin cleaning pads on the right side of the printer using a long-nose plier similar to a tweezer, and also soaked and cleaned those of the all the goo.  I cleaned that area of the printer using Windex and Q-tips.  I don't know if I harmed the printer by doing this, but at least now it works.  I thought maybe I'd have to throw away the printer, before this fix.  I will never buy these junk refills again, I'll stick with the genuine Canon cartridges.Original review:Update: after the LD cartridge printed with the wrong ink level, I can't get the nozzle unclogged on my IP100 printer no matter what I try with the utilities.  I think this LD cartridge messed up my print head.I bought a pack of these cartridges because of the good price, but now I'm going back to Canon genuine ink.

R2BU4A614Z0N21,"Am on my third one from Epson and still having problems.  Using genuine ink we have had a variety of problems in our small business.  The concept is good but the printer itself just hasn't delivered.  I'm not that picky but this thing can't function as good as a $50 throw away printer.Update 3.21.16 my review to Epson:Everything works great except the printing. (This is a printer after all) . Wifi, Lan, ADF, Scan to email, all wonderful. This printer was first purchased when it was new technology. (Oct 2014)  We use this printer in a small business environment but we are on our 4th replacement from Epson and now Epson refuses to work with us.  Out of warranty.  My main complaint is misaligned text and lines through text. This has been a common theme with this printer.  I've run countless nozzle cleanings and alignments but to no avail.  I use genuine Epson ink and staples general printer paper.  So there is no mystery there.  The printer is in a closed office with two office managers and a controlled climate.  Ie constant temperatures and minimal air particulates.  I like to think I'm not that picky but I firmly believe that hard to read text is an issue, so is smearing and random splotches of color.  I have used Epson products for years and still have an epson printer at home that works just great but this 5690 series for us has really left a bad tasted in my mouth.  Service recently told me that I can buy a new printer at a reduced rate (loyalty program)  Why would I want another epson when the one I have doesn't work? Probably going to try out a canon or xerox multifunction. Hopefully the epson projector I just bought works better.",0,0
R14ZFNIJ77ILKW,"This may be more a review of Amazon's business practice issues than the scanner, but I wanted to bring it up.I received the item in a box with ZERO packing material around it, as usual from Amazon, in a box several times larger than the box the item was in.  This made me cringe, since this was an electronic device and probably should not be crashed around in a box during transit.  I had paid $12 for two-day shipping and got the poor packaging for my money. (Absolutely no items I have ordered from Amazon have ever get packed properly for their nature, as in breakable items are always just thrown in the box.)My fears came true.  The scanner was completely non-functional.  There is seemingly a power light, this never came on when plugged in, if that is the function of that part (I cannot find any information about that on their web site).  My computer eventually did recognize the existence of the scanner, but the scanner itself was totally unresponsive.  No power light, no ""grabbing"" of the inserted paper (I was even using the ""calibration paper"" they included with the scanner), and the scan button was not clickable on the scanner or in the software program.  After uninstalling and reinstalling the software and trying multiple other USB ports, I was once able to click on the 'scan' button on the program, but got a message that the scanner was unable to scan and then the option to do so again was greyed out again.At first, I downloaded the update, then uninstalled that and put the original software back on but there was no change.  I suspect that this particular scanner was returned to Amazon.com by someone else because it was broken, and then it was sent to me; the software disc was opened and the CD sleeve was torn and wrinkled.Do note that the software that comes with the scanner is from 2008, and you have to go download the newer version (only if you know if your computer is 32 bit or 64 bit), and then *that* software uninstalls everything you just spent 15 minutes installing.I have requested a replacement, as I really need this item's features to manage an immense mountain of receipts, but am not terrible hopeful that the outcome will be different with the second one unless Amazon bothers to pack their items properly for once.  As for the scanner itself, I will have to come back and add to this review if the next one they send me actually works.EDIT:  The second one arrived within one day of my asking for an exchange, though Amazon charged me for shipping on the second scanner even though it was their error.  It did come with one sheet of bubble wrap laid over top of the scanner, woo.The second one seems to work properly.  It does not obtain all of the information off of many receipts; it hardly ever gets the name of the business or the sales tax.  You will have to type these in yourself.  The software is not very organized in that the ability to create categories is limited to the pre-defined ones in the program and duplicate categories are easy to make if you try to define your own sub-categories.  As an example ""Personal Expenses"" is one of the three choices, and you have to put all personal expenses under that heading and still try to separate them somehow.  Not terribly intuitive or helpful.  I have not yet tried to export to Quicken, but will as soon as possible.",0,0
ROP60CB3YVJ8P,"I normally dont write reviews but feel this is warranted. I bought this as a cheaper replacement for the OEM replacement toner after reading all the reviews.

This toner is being replaced with factory Samsung toner.",0,0
R13WPJLU9L5X1B,"I consider myself a very informed consumer especially on fountain pens. I enjoy them very much but something about spending 50$+ on a pen always requires a lot of mental brainwashing with positive reviews/feedback to get me to buy a $$$ pen. I often make this comparison, I can buy a Table saw... or a fountain pen! Yes they are indeed instruments of luxury and I am as frugal as it gets so it makes a bitter standstill sometimes. However if you are like me and read even a little into fountain pens you will find Pilot pens to be dripping in positivity. Their metropolitan,74, Falcon, ect. The list goes on. I have used every one and let me tell you none (including this one) have done anything for me.The pen itself is well build and it gives thick durable feel to it, something you know would withstand a drop. It weighs 22.36g with a CON-70 converter in it half full. Which to reference is less than a metropolitan (27.28g). If you are someone who likes huge, thick, heavy pens this one is right on the acceptable line. It's a standard thickness in the hand for a pen. Overall this pen is an okay looking pen, I personally believe the saying ""beauty is in the eye of the beholder"" to be untrue as almost everyone can tell you what is nice looking and what is not. By that standard I can say I think you will find this pen to not be very eventful looking. The cap is a screw on/off which I enjoy very much as it adds a level of security to potential splashes from drops and or just general lugging around. The nib is silver not the gold tint that you see here. Don't Panic! it's gold. If you look at the nib it will say 14k. The build quality is the only reason for the 2 stars.Writing is what you would expect from a Pilot Pen. Awful, inconsistent, Skippy at best. The pen will write very good so long as you only write down. So if your name is ilililil you're in good shape, my name however is nick and when wrote with this pen it comes out as ""l l i c l"". A majority of the days this pen choose to write dry (that's what I wanted) however during this time your pen will often bottom out and not lay down any ink and skip. Other days it will chose to write like a wet medium which makes your handwriting look like a gorilla wrote it, thick and bumpy. The nib is as springy as you would expect from a gold nibbed pen but that really is about it. The reason I was so persistent on pilots was because positive reviews and the statement that eastern pens supposedly have finer nibs. This is partially true, outside of some German pens most fines are about all the same. My Parker and Lamy write just as fine as this. So the allure to stick to eastern pens just because of a finer fine is so negligible.What I don't understand is the ?fan base? of pilot pens. Doing deeper reading on this pen you will find it's inconsistency to be a not so much a problem but a guarantee. The fountain pen community is a very tight-knit community and most well seasoned fountain pen owners DO NOT recommend this pen or the 92 for the same reasons above. However there is always a group of people that love their pilot pens. There is a story of a guy who got a pilot 92 that didn't work day 1. He sent it in to pilot for repair and after 3 send backs to pilot later to get it fixed and 4 months of down time it still came back still inconsistent, the guy was bummed but still LOVED his junk pen. All in all after getting burned by multiple pilot pens at varying price points I can say for certain I will never buy a Pilot again, the proof is in the writing.Buy a Lamy 2000, now that is a thing to behold.",0,0
R1XR0FSW709INL,"The toners worked initially, but after using them for a bit (you can see how much toner is left in each in the photos above) they started to streak and produce weaker colors than other toners I've used before.

RQJ9DM88W875R,"UPDATE FROM RECENT PURCHASE (1 June 2013):So, I initially bought one of these bulbs in 2012 for my Epson Home Cinema 8500UB, and it was amazing -- great color for a fraction of the price, and I gave it a 5 star rating. The bulb lasted about 1400 hours before it became dimmer and dimmer, and fearing that it was going to go out, I decided to buy two more of them.And something has clearly changed within the last year, because both of these bulbs were made differently. They were difficult to fit in the projector, to the point where -- for each of them -- I had to remove a screw to keep both of them in.And, more disturbingly, the brightness was HORRIBLE out of the box. Worse yet, when an image went from dark to light, you could watch the bulb change -- almost as if it couldn't handle the changes in dynamic brightness. I was really concerned that my projector was broken, but before looking at a repair that was a few hundred dollars, on a lark I decided to order a genuine Epson bulb for $299 from their site.Not only did it fit right in, but the bulb is AMAZINGLY bright than either of the new ones were. No more generic bulbs for me.",0,0

R1T11TEBLQXM1Y,"We bought this printer last summer when we wanted to upgrade to a wireless printer. We selected this model because it had good reviews and had multiple color cartridges and would more efficiently use ink. This printer does many things well. It prints well over wireless.  It prints pictures wonderfully.  BUT even set on the thick paper setting, it is an effort in frustration to print on cardstock. (And sadly, I need to do this often!)This morning, I  spent over an hour trying to print 12 copies on cardstock.

R1PG78LJ4475PP,"I replaced the base plate on my office chair with this and for all intents it looks and feels really similar, but after sitting on it for two days the front of the chair now slopes forward slightly and it keeps triggering the air canister to send the chair to its maximum height (and to RELEASE it!).

R1GITT316Q8BKX,"I rarely find myself dissatisfied after purchasing items that have generally high ratings and positive reviews. This particular tape - of all things - had to be the exception to that norm.My ask of sticky tapes is simple - hold brown corrugated paper boxes together, be easy to apply, easy to tear. The last of these is generally an issue with other packing tapes - you need a pair of scissors or a knife to cleanly cut the tape off. This tape, without any doubt, makes it very easy to hand-tear when you are done.However, I also expect a sticky tape to actually stick. The material used here is much thicker than regular tapes, and if you don't stick it back onto itself (i.e. going all around the box), the edges start curling up and coming loose after a few days. I used this tape, for example, to stick some labels on to cleaning fluid spray bottles, and all of them have come off after a few months.I went back to the basic Scotch disposable dispenser with packing tape -  http://amzn.com/B003W0P2SA - and love it.

R1FYHLGT5H1VG5,"We purchased the neat Scanner 15 months ago and have really liked how it helped to organize all of our business receipts. heck, we even talked a friend of ours into buying one.  Then after about a year, all the problems started. It became very difficult to import/export old files, would only scan 1 receipt at a time, many issues with the files and folders and finally unreadable scans. When I called customer service, (and I say that GENEROUSLY) the first time I was told to delete a QSP file to get it to scan more than one receipt at a time which worked but then the images were so bad that you cant read them. So I called them again and got a woman who had me calibrate, calibrate, plug, unplug, etc. (she was so pressed to get me off the phone that I actually mentioned it to her) and I still got no results, just a promise that someone would get back with me after I emailed her an image of a poor quality receipt so they could determine what the problem was. Cricket....cricket....cricket.....cricket.....In the meantime I ordered more cleaning sheets and calibration papers,  and calibrated and cleaned with still no change. It was 4 days and no phone call or email, so I called again. This time I spoke with another woman who had me take another scan and when I told her it was still hard to read, she said that she was ""determining at this time that your scanner is defective"" and more or less let me know that I would not be receiving any more help. Of course after reading all the reviews, which I wish I would have read before I bought it, and having my own experience with 'customer service' I was not surprised at the rudeness of this girl. However, I was given the offer to buy a new one for $100.00 less, ($299.99). When I asked her if she was aware of the reviews that say that this product does not last much more than 12-18 months she says 'well some customers get two years'. WOW!!!!

As soon as I saw it I immediately bought it because it was exactly what I was looking for and I thought it was adorable. I couldn’t wait for it to arrive and it came early, even better! So I thought, until I opened the box. As soon as I lifted it out of the box the bubble wrap bag drooped as if something was weighing down (very thin bubble wrap bag at that). The item weighing it down was the broken drawer front of one of the center drawers. Split clean just under the handle, the drawer front didn’t just come off the sides it snapped 9/10s of the way down, shown in my pictures. Immediately after that I noticed the texture of the wood is very rough, it doesn’t seem sanded down nearly enough, to the point where in some places I was worried about getting a splinter. Looking at it further I found visible nail holes on every side from where it was nailed together, something that could’ve easily be hidden with a little wood filler and a little sanding. There are dents and dings in multiple places but that kind of adds to the charm so whatever. Then I looked inside one of the intact drawers and there is an exposed nail that could easily cut your finger open you weren’t paying attention. If this item had been an absolute bargain I would’ve over looked some of these issues and simply asked for a replacement for the broken drawer, but considering I spent $70 I’m very disappointed. And to add a cherry on top, based on other reviews, I don’t feel confident I would get an adequate piece in replacement! Overall I do not recommend this piece from this company AT ALL!! Spend your money more wisely somewhere else.",0,0
R2L4ATNVBN69A9,"I purchased this product and from the very start, the scans were virtually unreadable. If it were possible to give it less than one star, I would have. I repeatedly calibrated the device with no improvement. I called their customer service number for assistance and got a voice message to visit their website for assistance, either open a customer service ticket or speak with a representative in ""live chat."" No where on their website was an option for live chat. After submitting two tickets, each with attached images of the scan quality, I then went on to look for information on how I could modify brightness and contrast, hoping this would help. The manuals (not included, but on-line) indicated a tool option that should appear at the bottom right corner of the scan image. I could find no such option there or in the menu options. It's been two days and no word from Neat. I have run, crisp, clear, wrinkle-free receipts through this repeatedly after calibration and tried every possible setting before hand in hopes of a better scan with no luck. This is a piece of junk and I've never been sorrier to buy a product. The IRS would never accept these receipt ""scans"" (and I use the term loosely) as documented proof of expenses. Meanwhile, I spent the same amount of time the following day (that I did the day I set it up and tried to resolve the scan quality issue) entering 6 months of receipts by hand in a simple profit and loss spread sheet I customized in Excel and hand enter my purchases, keeping the hard receipts for my backup. This ultimately ended up being faster, easier and cheaper. Don't waste your time, desk space or money.",1,1

R2AW62FOUMVF3H,Don't rely on the reviewer that said it was prettier than this picture.  It isn't.  I hoped it looked like the other Grolier journal pictures.  It doesn't.  The picture can look attractive from the side when you catch the gold glints.  But straight on it is ugly and muddy to me.  When I saw it I thought of the cheap diaries that you might have given a kid in the 1970s. The clasp and small size of the journal and wide lined paper gives it that impression.

R2ZZPP7VZEU5QU,"I bought the undated planner as a gift for my cousin. She has been using the LOA planner since 2016 and has refused to change to another planner, she loved her LOA planner. However, when it arrived we saw that the font and color of the planner has changed from the one purchased June 2018 (she did not like that) and that it was missing pages (skips from page 30 to 41) and pages 41-51 were falling off. Page 51 had numbers written in the date boxes (not accurate to July's dates) and there was writing on the back pages (""Serendipity"") as well as some of the stickers were missing but no where to be found on the planner.

R2J7PIYW24I3SU,"I owned this projector for nearly three years and it was pretty good. Buying bulbs is a pain, but that was the trade off for having a huge screen minus a big, giant television in my living room.Also, know that the hours you get out of a bulb are nowhere near what the bulb manufacturer's advertise. That goes for the non-generic Epson bulbs, too. They advertise a few thousand hours, but we were getting under 1,000 hours (800 usually). Also, the picture gets darker the last fifty hours or so of viewing causing some eye strain.The one star: I bought a bulb off of Amazon, more specifically through a Seller. I installed the bulb (my third or fourth) and within a minute or so of being turned on I smelled burning plastic. The red warning lights were on and I Immediately shut off the projector. The projector was really hot, so I let it cool down and put in my old bulb, that still worked. The projector now did not work at all.We took the projector into a repair service to have it diagnosed and they told us the motherboard was burned out and it would cost so much to repair we may as well buy a new one.That one, stupid bulb fried my projector.We contacted the Seller several times who said it was our projector not his bulb. After doing a little research we found out the Seller was doing business from out of an apartment in Queens. This was a Seller on Amazon. Shady.We contacted Amazon to let them know and to try to get some compensation for what was a $1600 projector. They also refused to take any responsibility for having a Seller that sold a defective product that destroyed our projector. We tried to deal with Customer Service many times, but like a typical internet company their customer service is completely lousy and they just send you around in circles.So, be careful in buying generic bulbs, be careful in what Sellers you use because some are shady and Amazon will not back you up with their ""A-Z guarantee"" if you have any problems. In the end, we just went to Best Buy and dealt with a lovely salesperson and bought a 55 inch Sharp that was on sale for less than the cost to get our projector fixed. We also got a four year warranty included.",0,0

R1JZMZFX0MX3VJ,"Previously, I have given this item four stars.  It's been a year now that I've been using the pencils, and I've finally declared the experiment a failure.  I've given up and revoked my 4-star rating & downgraded to a 2-star.The pencils are fine, when they work.  But the quality control just isn't there.  The last pack of pencils I bought all failed within 2 weeks.  That's a loss of 5 pencils in half a month.  And that's abysmal.  I've had other pencils jam or fail to advance at a rate of about 1 every two weeks.  At the costs I've calculated at the bottom of this review, I can buy standard 4B pencils at almost half the cost of one of these and it will last the same two weeks.It's a shame, because I really wanted this to work out.  I really like the idea, but the build quality just isn't there.  I cannot recommend this pencil.Here is the original review, if you are still interested:This is the second pack of these I've purchased.  The first pack was of two - one stopped working after a few weeks, and the second was stolen.  I've been using my latest pencil for a few weeks and can provide a pretty definitive report on the two samples I've used for the past month, I think.The casing on these pencils is plastic, of course, and I found it difficult to get a grip on them at first.  They look like wood, but aren't, and I think I had to teach myself how to hold them so they don't slip out of my fingers, the friction coefficient on plastic being different than the wood they look like but aren't.  Maybe it was just me.The eraser is permanently attached to the end - you can't change it.  That's a bummer, because you can't put in a new eraser when the one attached wears out.  But if you are using a mechanical pencil in the first place, you probably don't make that many mistakes to begin with.  Mechanical pencils are not for the error-prone.  That being said, the erasers are pretty tough.  They work well, with very little wear.  I think it is highly unlikely that you would wear out the eraser in the lifetime of the pencil.  And if you think you would, then go back to a regular disposable pencil - mechanical pencils are clearly not your thing.The automatic feed is great, most of the time.  I like that I don't have to advance the pencil lead, or worry if it is too long - the pencil takes care of it.  Sometimes it advances it a little too far, but not so far that it becomes a problem.  The feed is a little short more often, forcing you to write straight up, instead of at a more natural angle.  This usually rectifies itself as you write, so no big worries.Damp paper/conditions have an adverse affect.  Sometimes, when I try to write on damp paper, the automatic feed doesn't work right, and I have to jab the paper to get the lead to advance.  It's not a big deal, and it doesn't happen often, but it does happen occasionally, especially in my line of work, so I keep a backup handy.You can't see the progression of the lead.  Most mechanical pencils are clear, so you can judge how short the lead is, and when it might be time to change it.  This pencil is opaque, so you have to guess when the lead needs to be changed.  I've found that you need to just use it until it stops working, then change the lead.  Changing the lead is easy, just unscrew the top, drop in a new one, and screw it closed, but there is absolutely no warning that the lead will fail.  And that leads me to my last, and biggest complaint:The automatic feed does not use all of the lead.  Unlike most mechanical pencils that will use a lead down to a nubbin, the automatic pencil leaves a considerable amount of unused lead when it stops writing.  I suspect that it's something about how much lead the automatic system needs to operate being much more than a manual pencil needs.  It's not that big of a deal because you get four leads with each pencil, and leads aren't that expensive anyway, but it is surprising how much lead is ejected from the pencil when you reload it after it stops writing.I've read complaints about short lifespan with these pencils.  I've only had one pencil fail on me after a few weeks of daily use, so I'm not in a position to comment on it.  I think that the idea behind these pencils is to have it be cheap and easy enough to use that you don't mind losing one from time to time, rather than an being an expensive, high-performance pencil, that you will kick yourself if you lose it.  And if you are in a place where your pencil might be stolen or lost, then better a 2$ one than a 20$ one, right?  Besides, I like the simplicity of the pencil itself.  No buttons, no clips - just a standard No. 2 that never goes dull.  Outstanding.UPDATE: So I've been using these pencils since mid-July.  I've since had 5 pencils break, and one that was stolen.  So, doing the math, (4 months[rounded] x 30 days[avg mo.] = 120[days]/5[pencils lost due to wear, not counting the stolen one] = 3.4 weeks average pencil life.  At the current price of a 5-pack, you would spend 2.50$ every three+ weeks, or the entire amount of 12.52$ every 4 months, given the rate of attrition.  For me, that's a good deal, especially when I always have a sharp point and don't have to waste time constantly sharpening up a pencil.  I replaced the standard HB lead with a B lead and the pencils work much better under the harder conditions I subject them too.  I stick with my four star rating because the basic shortcomings outlined above have not been overcome by Ticonderoga.  I would still recommend this item.",0,0
R2548CSB77ZNQW,"I have had the portable scanner for several years.  I use it to scan all my receipts for personal use.  I also use quicken.  The original software ""proprietary system of filing"" was OK, but not great.  I was able to use it to handle all of my receipts, 5-10 a day.  The software recognition at that time was not great requiring me to edit all of my receipts, but I learned how to use it.Upgrading to the 5.0, the software filing system that now comes with the scanner, has been more frustrating than any other software experience.  Other than Quicken's biyearly extortion, this takes the cake.  With Quicken you begrudgingly pay the fee because in the end, the program still works and even with all the problems and the fact that it is not perfect, you always know you can get by with it.Now the scanner with the new 5.0 software seems to do a much better job of recognizing the information on the receipt and getting it correct.  However, the filing system and program is far from intuitive requiring a significant amount of time reviewing the instructions.  Even then, again, it is not intuitive and also it is cumbersomely slow.If you have 100 receipts in a folder, you can count on the program taking over 20 seconds to load.  This means that switching between folders is time consuming and frustrating.  Accidentally clicking a folder with 2-300 receipts will have your blood pressure up and your anger at a maximum as there is nothing you can do until the computer loads the entire folder.  Each folder is loaded as you click on it, again and again, so if you go from one folder to another, you must wait each time.It is a great concept, but the software based on my use and based on my readings of what professional software developers have to say on the internet is nearly worthless unless you are only storing a few receipts a month.I wanted this program to easily search through years of receipts in order for me not to have to go through hundreds of receipts by hand in multiple shoe boxes of receipts.  When I need a receipt for a return, I wanted to search it on the computer and find where it is to make getting the original easier.  Just having the receipts on the computer does not help as most stores will not accept a printed copy of the receipt.  For on line purchaces and warranty, it is useful if transmitting a copy of the receipt will work.  However, I find most still want you to mail the original.  This means you still must have a hard copy in a filing cabinet and an antiquated filing system to parallel this computerized version.  Still the concept and how I used it worked pretty good.  However, the new software makes the supposedly easy time saving task a Herculean effort.  After spending all the money on the product and years of use, I find that a good file cabinet with folders works much better and easier than the new 5.0 upgrade or rather what is currently being sold.Here is what I want to be able to do with the system.  I want to double click on the icon and have the program boot immediately.  I want to take the receipts from my wallet and scan them quickly into the scanner.  I then want to review my receipts from an un-reviewed folder and migrate them into the proper folders.  This was the way the older program worked.  I want to switch back and forth from folder to folder and have the folder already loaded and available like the old program or Quicken, so I don't have to wait for each folder to load, each time.  I don't want to have to limit my folder sizes because the program takes too long to load a folder with more than 10 receipts.  These are the things I want from a system, but sadly the new 5.0 upgrade and program that is sold with the scanners today does not deliver.As a stand alone portable scanner, it has given me years of trouble free use.  So far I really have nothing bad to say about the actual physical tool.  I appreciate the improvements in receipt recognition with the 5.0 upgrade as it is rather good.  However, the program is just not intuitive, it is not easy, and it is frustratingly slow and cumbersome to the point of annoyance.The one star rating may not be totally accurate as there are good things to say about this, but in the end the negatives make this nearly unusable as an efficient way to digitally file receipts and I could not in good conscience get someone to invest the time and effort into a new filing system that does not make their filing easier.  You still need hard copies of receipts for just about everything but the IRS.  The old physical filing cabinet and folders worked great for probably over 100 years and being you still need it, I cant say the effort of digitizing the receipts with this system is worth your time and effort the way it currently stands.",0,0

R30RANAA9NIX9G,"Unfortunatley, this cartridge does NOT work with my M29w printer, despite having a ""chip"". The printer gives a ""memory error"" and will not print.

So I'm giving HP a one star review for their ""proprietary cartridge"" printer as well.",0,0

R13TDBQGO2WZEN,"I purchased this item because of it's good overall reviews and the price was decent. When I took it out of the box I noticed that the whole thing is made out of plastic. In giving it the benefit of the doubt, I extended the legs and tilted the laptop base (which only has a one-sided hinge, made out of plastic, and really flimsy). I placed my 16.5"" laptop on the tray and it slid right off onto the bed (thank God). I tried it again making sure I had the laptop base behind the ""ledge"" so it would stay. Evidently, the ""ledge"" wasn't tall enough, because my computer slid off again. Pretty frustrated by now, I placed a microfiber towel underneath so it would keep the computer from sliding (that helped). When I set up my mouse, and being right handed, it worked out great because there is only one choice in mouse placement...on the right side...FAIL. To make a long story short, I decided to return it and look for another, more sturdy tray, and I'm willing to pay an extra 10-20 bucks to get a better one.",0,0
R2G0JXFS0J7C5Q,"Hi All,My hope that it was going to work with our 2-3 year old HP printer/scanner model# C4250. I thought, these cartridges are so expensive, surely there must be another option. When I saw original ""HP packaging"" I thought, well this sounds a little better than the other options on Amazon. Even if it doesn't work great or there isn't a lot of ink in there, I can just take it to Costco and get it refilled there. The cartridge itself had a professional sticker on there that said ""NOT AN HP PRODUCT"", which I was not surprised about.Unfortunately, my printer didn't even recognize it. It just gave the generic error message; ""PRINT CARTRIDGE(S) MISSING OR NOT DETECTED"". I tried different trouble shooting options, like taking the cartridge in an out, taking the other cartridge out, unplugging the printer, etc. Unfortunately nothing worked.It seems the HP is doing what they can to make sure you don't use NON HP products like this cartridge. 1 hour after I opened the package that did arrived in good shape and on time by the way, I am returning it. I hope to be able to update this review and tell you that they refunded my money with no trouble.Let me know if there is really no other option, but the original HP cartridge?Happy Amazon shopping.",0,0

R3QL8M0PCLXK83,"I dislike how much these pens skip. The only way I can keep the pen from skipping is to push down pretty hard to keep the ink flowing. It's like you have to push the roller ball out of the way so the ink can come out. This makes it really uncomfortable for writing. The cushion grip is on the firm side. I find the ink to be very thin and watery, not like other gel pens I've used. It does make the ink dry faster, but it also makes the line come out pretty wide. The ink colors don't always match the pen color, although I don't really mind that much. For example, the magenta color is pretty light, the medium blue looks more light teal, the red is really bright, almost a deep orange-y red, and the navy is nearly black. With all the other positive reviews, I can't help but wonder if I got a bad batch or if they make changes to these pens.",0,0

R3KYI6XY6QOTVU,"Agree with the other negative reviews, once I have it in my hand trying to use it for what I really needed.There are only 110 hues (real CMYK combinations) :( That's surprisingly few if you consider the whole spectrum, and the number of grays and beiges included. For example, there are approximately 8 cards you might classify as ""red,"" so if you're trying to match a red hue that doesn't fit one of those 8 reds, you're out of luck. And that's being generous on the color range; some of those are more pink or orange, so there are really like 3 true variations on red.On top of that, the ""1210 shades"" really are just shades: they're a halftone tint that doesn't really give you any new color information regarding the print look itself, it just shows you what less of that color will look like on the page. In contrast, the Pantone CMYK or Bridge books give you thousands of distinct ink mixes with different CMYK values, which is an entirely different world if you want to try to match something and understand the result of a little more black, or a little less yellow.It's definitely a great value, and that's why I'm choosing 2 instead of 1 stars: you can get a good idea of what various basic colors will look like printed, and maybe you can fudge and average between two close colors to get something in the middle. For my needs however, it looks like I'll have to invest in the Pantone bridge book, with thousands of real hue and color mix variations.Since there are few 1- or 2- star reviews on this, I brought it down a bit to highlight these discrepancies—but if what you want is to have a variety of hues and start to build your instincts for how CMYK will vary from screen to print, this is a good basic start, and you certainly shouldn't spend more if you don't need it. However, if you're doing real print work often, the Pantone guides are the standard for a reason. I just wish I could borrow them from the library for the 1 or 2 times per year I really need them...",0,0

R1I1FO7JS922XU,"When you look at the different reviews, it's really hard to know what your experience will be.  I saw that most said their bulb worked well.  Mine did not.  It was WAY dimmer (like 75% dimmer) than my previous bulb which already had 2500 hours on it.  Also, the colors were way off, like a red tint to everything.  Perhaps because it was so dim it didn't push light through properly, but I'm not sure.  In any case, the bulb is useless to me, and I'm asking for a refund on it.Another note, if you get a smell to a new projector bulb, that's really normal.  After several hours of use, it should be burned in properly.  As for the one I received in particular, I even wondered if perhaps I had received a used bulb somehow, but it did have that distinctive burning smell to it.

I should have read the other reviews as someone already pointed this out but I was dumb enough to just look at all the five star reviews.  I won't bother returning them but I won't be buying these again.  They are nice bright colors and they say super sticky on the pack so these are perhaps high end ones that cost more.

R1DZY3G6LJKRIM,"(adding this to the review below:  The company, Honeywell, or whatever their US business name is, is terrible.  Trying to get answers our of them is like puling teeth and they.  They rarely call back.  They are vague with their answers.  They basically ask you to buy and use this on faith.  No one from there has yet to respond to how do the plastic clasps work if a fire melts them?  Nobody has yet to answer how it works for digital media if it isn't certified for that.  Really poor no matter how good or bad the chest is.) I may be returning this.  The ad (and the box) says it is waterproof for up to 48 hours and it says it is good for digital media.  So far, the only credentials I can find on it is a UL 350 / 1700 sticker.  That takes care of fire for paper only.  It needs to have an additional certification, either ETL or UL class 125 for digital proper interior temperature to actually be usable for digital media.  It needs something else for water testing.  When I called Honeywell, they seemed to be intentionally vague about it, never saying what certification it had.  I have emailed the manufacturer to get the certification numbers.  If legit, that should be no problem.  If it doesn't have them, then the claim is based on design and not independent testing.  That would be useless.

R33BZGP7Y2EIFP,"As a person without private transportation, it's really hard to shop without a cart. I searched everywhere I could think of to find a cart in a brick-and-mortar store, but when I couldn't, I looked at Amazon. This cart seemed to be a good price and didn't have the *worst* reviews, so I went ahead an ordered it.When the cart showed up, it was clearly damaged. The metal was bent and the basket had been assembled improperly. I had to switch around the way the basket was installed so that the wheels would install properly. (The way it was assembled, both sets of wheels would have been on the same side!) To make matters worse, due to the way the metal was bent, I couldn't install the wheels correctly -- there was no way to get the pin on the other side of the bar.Once assembled, I was worried about its ability to actually hold anything. So I took it on a test run to the grocery store a few blocks from us. It's supposed to be able to carry 50 pounds? Nope. The axle snapped on the way back and the entire cart collapsed. The fun part was carrying all of my groceries the last block.I imagine that even if my cart hadn't arrived in such poor shape that it would have still been awful.

R1PA9XICI90LKH,"I really wanted to love these pens as I have read a lot of really good reviews for them. However, they didn't work for me. My natural pen holding position has the pen slanted at about a 45-degree angle - it's not super slanted, but it's not very upright either. As a result, the pen nib sort of scratched along the paper. It still worked, but it didn't feel smooth at all and the sound of the scratching was really annoying. I tried writing with the pen a bit more upright and it did flow really nicely and didn't scratch, but it felt very unnatural for me.It is such a shame because the inks in these pens are really unique and fun. Each pen has black ink that is tinged with a different color. The purple-black and green-black were my favorites, and I just so wished they would have worked with my grip. This is a really unique idea and I've not seen it with any other brands of pen.If you have a more upright pen grip, I would highly recommend these. If you are more slanted, these might not be the best choice.",0,0

R3U56JOXFZOXPB,"I rarely write reviews, but this unit does not do what it says it does, and I'd like to save another potential buyer from going through what I did. If all you want to do is scan and organize papers, I think that this unit would be FABULOUS once you get it installed and start using it (this is not a quick or easy task). However, IF YOUR GOAL IS TO EXPORT, I would not buy this unit. Since that is my purpose, I'm returning it.I bought this with the intent of scanning charge receipts from my business and exporting them into Quickbooks. The box and information say that Neat will do this. I hate this task, and I thought the money would be well worth the time savings.Installation: The box comes with version 4 of the software. However, version 5 is out, so you are directed to the internet to obtain it as prior problems have supposedly been fixed. Their website is slow, freezes, and often links you to a non-functioning page. After multiple tries, I was able to download the software. It directs you to disable any internet firewalls or anti-virus software. Seems easy, but Firefox didn't have a pull down menu for this. Had to go to help and finally found out how to do this. (The time required for this was my ignorance and not Neat's, however, the same might be true of others as well).Usual policy to close all other programs during installation of a new program was followed. Finally ready to install, and it freezes and crashes my computer (Windows XP) and my wireless mouse multiple times. I had to endure many restarts of my computer (most had to be without proper shutdown and by using the on/off switch on my computer), and unplugging and plugging the USB connection to the computer for the wireless mouse. Three hours later, it finally installed.Starting: I'm pretty intuitive and usually start using a program and exploring menus without a problem. However, menus are not intuitive until you read the directions. Again, this is more time invested. Once reading the directions, I have to admit it was no problem using the machine, but it was cumbersome. The first thing is that although the scanning is pretty quick, it takes a while for the software to convert the data into a viewable receipt. Perhaps the best thing is to scan in a bunch of receipts, then go do something else while it works and come back later. I wanted to see if it exported properly before I invested a lot of time scanning. If you do have to go away and do something else while it is processing the scans, it takes away from the time saving purpose of using Neat.The next problem is each time you export a receipt, you have to drill down to tell Neat where you want it to export. This involves many clicks from My Computer, All users, shared documents, documents and settings, shared documents, Quickbooks, Company, etc. You can't set any or preferable locations. Then, you have to choose the account from Neat software to the account in QB's each time. Takes a lot of time. Batching the exports is definitely the way to go to make things efficient, but still not as much of a time saver as I thought it would be, especially when you have to keep selecting the accounts in QB's.Practical use: This is where the Neat fails miserably. I have an account in Quickbooks where all the charge receipts go. They are listed with the vendor, date purchased, and the account that they go into e.g. office supplies, hardware, software, etc. When Neat exports them, it exports them as bills to pay so are under accounts payable and not in the Charge Register under the account that I selected. To get that information, you have to then go to accounts payable. Therefore it is an extra step to go to accounts payable to see the detail to make sure it was correct as well as to look at it for analysis on another occasion. Although that's not the way I record I QB's, I could live with that if it meant that I didn't have to enter all those receipts.  Another problem was that it wouldn't export credit card refunds.  It said it would not import because the amount was under $10!!  It seems absurd not to be able to export credits.  I didn't try to import and charges under $10 so I don't know what it would do there.However, the final thing that killed the deal was that the exported items all come in with the date exported, and not the date of purchase. I tried several different things, checked online forums, help, but there wasn't anything about correcting this. There is no live help; help and customer service are only available by email. I got an email back that says they will get to me when they can. Given that, I went through all the menus, help info, and user forums. My conclusion was that there appears to be no fix for that. If I have to go into each receipt to fix the date, I might as well just enter them.Conclusion: The problems using this to export to Quickbooks make is such that it just doesn't do the job. There are multiple steps to define the program to export to each time, define the account to go to each time, then go to accounts payable to view the details of the export, and then to change the date on the transaction. In addition you have to enter any refunds or credits manually and not through Neat as it won't export them.  This kills the whole idea to create efficiency and save time.",0,0

R2D1FI6N3HQ793,"My experience so far with this fire safe is so-so.  I too immediately noticed the cheap locking mechanisms that other reviews have documented.  The two clasps on either side of the safe are a cheap plastic, that clamp down with the aid of a cheap plastic spring that (on the right side) was bent upon delivery.  Clamping down those handles is still doable with some finagling.The safe was ""locked"" on delivery, but the latch that locks the chest was not in the slot it was supposed to be in that would keep it secure.  Instead, it's as though the key put the safe's latch in the ""locked"" position while it was fully open, then downward pressure from the chest's lid drove the locking latch into the plastic of the lid, putting a nice dent in the lid.  The result is that the chest will not securely lock.For my purposes, the safe doesn't have to lock, and it accomplishes what I need it to, so I'm keeping the safe, lesson learned: You get what you pay for.",0,0

Be warned that this box is slightly too heavy to have often movement.  If you dont plan to store it in one spot and/or need to move it a lot for whatever reason you should buy the roller base.The reason I gave it two star was the locking mechanism....I literally got the safe TODAY and in the process of opening/closing twice the box no longer locks. The part of the lock that rotates and hooks into the top of the safe doesn't seem to want to make it through/line up properly. The rotating part appears to be pretty malleable, more malleable than you'd want a piece to be that needs to line up perfectly with a slot.  After 30 attempts of trying to adjust the part I gave up (included using needle nose pliers gently to try and line it up). The idiotic thing is I just broke down the box and trashed it. Now I cannot return/replace. So basically I have a legal size, heavy, safe for documents that doesn't lock.",0,0
R2EM0QN9II27ZT,"It's a great scanner, but this listing says it does  ""medium-format slides is supported as well"" and it doesn't.  The light in the lid is not wide enough to do full highth medium slides or film and the software has no previsions to do anything other than 35mm film.  I was very disapointed.  The only way to do 120 medium format is to move the negitave around and make several scans and stich it together in a program like photoshop.  The biggest pain is that it will not let you set anything other than 35mm for film and it breaks up the scans to that size only for film or slides.  It wouldn't be so bad if it let you set the length of the slide.  Canon screwed up big time on their software with this as it's too restrictive and will not let you set any user defined size on film.  This scanner could have been great for 120, 8mm, or 16mm or 110 film strips, but it's not.  It is a great scanner other wise.  One other reviewer said it worked great on his 120 slides, but I don't see how as there is no setting for this and it has to cut the slides scanned area short.  I give this scanner a low rating for the software and not supporting the ""Medium-Format"" as the add lists",0,0

R2IZAGWAAIWYZO,"Another example of how a simple. inexpensive product has been ruined by cutting corners. The rub of all this is, that we are paying as much for  inferior products made in third world countries, as we did when they were made here in the USA. Oh well, the CEO and stockholders win again, we consumers lose. This thing at a glance looks like a blast out the past, but it isn't. The guide is so thin that the lock to hold the size position, is pushed out of square to the face. I didn't catch that it had only one cutter. As much slop as there is in this contraption, explains why it doesn't cut evenly. Yes, as one reviewer pointed out, one can rotate the pencil while cranking, will help with most pencils. And I noticed, that was with the pencils made in the USA. But for others it doesn't work so well. The bottom line is, that the single cutter is pushing the pencil to one side resulting in an uneven sharpening. Remember ?, the old ones always had to cutters, pushing the pencil to the center. Well, they've ruined all kinds things that worked so well, that we just take for granted that they will work well. Wrong!!!!. This just adds to the list of foreign made junk.",0,0

R35BWJWR3ADCBR,"Using this device, I've eliminated two large file cabinets from my office by storing everything digitally. I scan each document as a pdf and file it according to my own system. You can use NEAT's filing system, but I chose to override it to keep things simple.  Be aware that NEAT has a monopoly on the alcohol-saturated cleaning sheets that you'll need occasionally. With shipping, it'll cost you about $15 for just three of them.  They are not sold in stores.  UPDATE: I have lowered my rating from four stars to one because the unit no longer works properly and NEAT technical support -- after two dozen time-wasting interactions tied to the same case number -- cannot tell me why. The software crashes most of the time these days, which can be very annoying when you've scanned a ten-page document and are hoping not to generate the all-too-frequent message ""NEAT has stopped working...""  Under the circumstances, the problems I cited in my earlier, much more favorable review, are seeming less tolerable.  Read the despairing comments on NEAT's filing software and you'll see that this has been a major issue for the product.  I avoided the problem simply because (as I mentioned above) I scanned everything as a pdf and filed it manually. NEAT took a lot of heat for updating the software in a way that widowed scans done with earlier versions.",0,0
R2W9M9V5R5ZA8E,"Update 1/16/17: I was offered a refund for my purchase of ink if I agreed to update or remove the 2-star review that I had given. At no time, was it specified that the update must be positive. I’m changing my rating from 2 stars to 1 star, as since my first review, my printer has become non-operational. Initially I was able to print fine if I only needed to print in black ink. After several attempts with head cleanings, printer alignments etc., my printer will not even print in black, nor color. I now own an expensive paperweight. So, this ink may work for some, or it may not.Original review: I used these cartridges in an HP 8600 Office Jet Plus.  If you only need to print in black all the time then these refills would receive 5 stars.However, the black cartridge does something to mess up my color printing.  I first tried the Fuzoo black with genuine HP color cartridges that were already installed.  Colors were muddy and nowhere near to true.  I then tried replacing the HP cartridges with the color Fuzoo to use together with the Fuzoo black cartridge, same deal, no improvement.  I even opened and tried the 2nd black cartridge they sent thinking maybe the first was defective.  Color printing still would not work correctly.  I really wanted to like these cartridges since the price is beyond reasonable, but the way it messes up the color printing is unacceptable.I also tried cleaning the print heads and aligning the print heads several times.  Neither action worked and the aligning actually failed. Included in my review is a picture of images printed with the Fuzoo ink cartridges (left) and HP cartridges (right).",0,0

R2JWJZINEOWZ4O,"Based on reviews and photos, the description and the price, I was hesitant to buy the product and I should have listened to my gut feeling.1) The product is made almost entirely out of plastic and is so flimsy that I am afraid a strong wind will blow it over and tip my laptop off the stand.2) The height is somewhat adjustable, but not above 20 inches.  So, if you are a tall person or sit somewhere where the height is above 20 inches, then you will be sitting in a hunched position.3) The mouse pad is just big enough for the mouse, not the mouse and my hand, just the mouse.  So, if you plan on spending a lot of time on this, then best to not use it anything more than a coaster.

Cheap cheap cheap. the plastic legs were bending when they weren't supposed to. the laptop stand only supports one side of the laptop due to its one peg on the right underside. other than that this thing still wast worth the money... there were scratches all over the plastic. the ""mouse pad"" isn't aligned correctly, so it has a gap closer to you, and on the other end of the ""mouse pad"" it is pushed upwards, creating a mini mountain, which is rather irritating if you move your hands a lot on the mouse pad... and on the actual stand for the laptop there were scratches, plastic pieces around, and dents...  also where the legs are supposed to stay underneath, whilst not in use, by clips, one was missing. so if all this will pass your criteria for purchasing, then by all means do so, but for me, its getting returned ASAP.

R12JXD4O0QERR7,"I would highly deter anyone from purchasing this product! (I would give it zero stars if I could)I own all three NEAT products and can say that the hardware is OK...it is their software and non-existing customer support that makes this product unusable.Here is a link to Consumer Affairs regarding the Neat scanners:  www.consumeraffairs.com/document-scanners/neat.html  (63% gave it 1 star!)The list of problems I have had with this product is long, but here are the top complaints:-There is NO customer service. If you would like customer service you have to pay for it (after the initial purchase window) and their hours are only EST. I have owned my scanner since they first came out so I am grandfathered in for ""free"" customer support; even with that the last time I tried to reach a live voice it took a month of emailing back and forth first. On average every customer support session (when I finally reach a live person) has taken a minimum of 4-6 hours. Their cloud corrupted our companies files and it took a solid week to fix all of the computers.-Their cloud service is a joke. (Oh, and you have to pay monthly to use this service on top of purchasing the hardware and buying customer support!) I understand that if one has many .pdf files to upload to the cloud it takes time, yet Dropbox, Google Drive, Box, SugarSync, etc have figured it out...Neat has not. Their software is poorly written and slow.-Beyond the sync function if one simply tries to move folders, delete documents, or import/export files (No internet involved) it can take a day of waiting while it slowly processes and the program often shuts down.-One of the features that they claim as a high selling point is their search capabilities. I use this when putting in our companies receipts. In the notes portion I will place a tag so that I can easily search later on. Nowhere in their software do they have spell check, so if i accidentally misspell a tag then that search no longer is valid. Who, in this day and age does not have spell check in every dialog box?!The bottom line is that the software and its programming do not keep up with the technology that it uses. The Neat Co. then follows that up by providing little to no customer support...not a winning combination.We have now switched over to the Fujitsu ScanSnap ix500 it is a little more expensive but well worth it. In the end you will save money and a whole lot of time.",1,1

R2G7F5GH61BBEI,"We've been using Dymo label printers in our business for several years to print address labels. However, their software just would not work on a new Windows Terminal Server which all our users assess through thin clients. This Brother network printer seemed like it would do the job.The printer itself worked fine and the software did install on the Terminal Server. But, the software was a big disappointment (C- to D+ rating). Entering addresses was so much poorer compared to the Dymo that our users didn't like it at all.On the other hand, the Dymo application is an A+ rating. It even has a built-in address checker. With one click it runs the address through a UPSP database to verify the address, automatically make changes,  and generate a PostNet bar code.

R27CB429LFYTVM,"I'm disappointed in these screen protectors; part of the problem is the protectors themselves and part of the problem is Amazon.In my research, I've found there are two distinct types of screen protectors.  One type is a hard film with an adhesive backing.  When I've purchased these in the past (for other phones), the protector came with both a front and back layer to peel off; the front layer was rigid and the back layer protected the adhesive.  To apply, you peel off the back layer; the rigid front layer makes it easy to apply onto the phone.  You then peel off the front rigid layer and you are left simply with the protector covering the phone's screen.  This is the type of protector I wanted to purchase.The second kind of protector is a much softer plastic, almost like a vinyl.  There is no adhesive on this protector; the vinyl simply adheres to the screen.  This type tends to be harder to apply since there is nothing rigid to hold it straight while you are applying it.  I did not want to purchase this type of protector.  They are much harder to apply and they get many more bubbles underneath than the first type of protector.Reading the description of the protector and the other Amazon reviews, I was led to believe I would be purchasing the first type.  Unfortunately, due to the marketplace vendor I chose, I received the second type.This happens because the product listing is so broad (LCD screen protectors for Blackberry) that 3rd party vendors can really sell whatever type they choose under this listing.  I partially blame Amazon for this; they really should have more specific listing categories so customers know what they are getting.Now, for the price, it's hard to complain, and it is indeed a screen protector, but it's unfortunate that you really don't know what you are going to get.",0,0

R6S7K8017BGNP,"We tried to save money and go with a highly reviewed, less expensive cartridges for our Canon Laser printer. They worked for about 10 prints and then the powder got into everything and ruined my printer. It jammed the printer and appears that “savings” is going to result in a new printer.

R2JDIDI9JK0RHS,"I reviewed a few items for storing important documents (passport, org birth cert, legal documents). I settled on this because it has one of the higher fireproof standards as well as waterproof without being a safe or file cabinet. I felt both features were important. In that regard this fits the requirements .  I read the dimensions and weight, it is a hefty 45 pounds but I wouldn't want someone to be able to easily walk-off with this case; but you must be able to deal with the weight as the owner.STORAGE: as I indicated in the title, my main issue is with the bulk/size of the case.  The case height is 7-1/4"". Unfortunately, it doesn't fit under my bed (which was where I was going to store this). YOU CANNOT STAND THIS VERTICALLY or you negate the capability and/or effectiveness of the case - it must lay flat. At 19""W and 16""L  and 7.25""H - it takes up a lot of room. Be prepared for that.AIRED-OUT: It is adamantly recommended that monthly, the case is opened and aired-out, to prevent mold from occurring. For some that may not be an issue, but for others, wherever you store this, that may be problematic. I have purchased silica gel packets to put in the case and hopefully those will help. For those who want to store documents and forget it; that is not possible.KEYS: This case is locked with keys (not a code). You must maintain the keys and know their ID number if you lose them. If a fire occurred (tragic) and the box survived and you didn't have the keys, you could probably break into the case using other implements but you should probably have a key stored off-premises.In the end, I believe the case would protect the documents enclosed, which is the point, but ability to move this case, access for airing-out and storage are also important to consider.",0,0

R356UAS7ZOUW1B,"EMAIL SERVER SETUP is not working after spending countless hours with my ISP and Epson technical support on the phone. I bought htis printer because it had 5 stars. Everywhere I found awesome reviews. It was a pretty straightforward process to set up EXCEPT when it came to setting up the Email Server which is in Advanced Settings.  You SHOULD be able to set up any pop3 email account as your email server and scan and email. I tried 3 different accounts, gmail; outlook; frontier, and none of the accounts worked. I have an older lexmark that i set up using the same accounts and it worked beautifully. Why is it so difficult to set up on this printer? I called EPSON three times, 1st time the tech who was clueless said i have to call my ISP and have them enable udp/tcp and enable 3 different port numbers. When I called my ISP, (FRONTIER), they said thats ludicrous. So they wanted to help me but Frontier passed me along to 4 other departments but noone knew what to do, so after 2 hours of that I gave up. I called up EPSON technical support again, and the 2nd time they made me hold 25 minutes and then they hung up and the 3rd time they made me hold 40 minutes and they picked up the phone at 10:59 est. and said not in a recorded voice but a live voice, we are closed now, call back in the morning!!

The Foam inside was cut incorrectly which made the cushion (1) shorter then advertised (2) having a gap between the two sides, since it folds in half.I attempted to look past this but since the whole point of this is comfort, it didn't hold merit to the point of displeasure when trying to ""ignore"" these issues. Normally this is a.. well, you ""get what you pay for"" type of situation, but lets be real, this is a $40 foam block.. so no, i need this replaced with one that is advertised.Ok, no problem... ill contact the company and hopefully they will help me out.I emailed the support address ""support@deskjockey.net"" and attached the same 3 pictures i included here and this was the (only) email i received..""Good Afternoon,Wow!

R3JOVSURJW1QCM,"I was really excited about this machine, but it leaked from the very first day. The hose attachment for the sink was missing, so we had to go to the hardware store to get a hose and connectors just to try the thing, only for it to leak on the floor. This machine doesn't drain fully on its own, even with the pump that the 17lb capacity machine has, so you have to put a pan or bucket low enough and tip it after use to try to get the rest of the water out of the hose and basin under the agitating tub (or take it outside to drain), the plumbing underneath this thing is glued together cheap plastic so there's no real way to repair it when it leaks, and the seller is third party from china, so if you have a problem, forget about a refund or sending it back - it's just not going to happen. So after going back and forth with the seller and Amazon for weeks, you'll just end up eating the wasted money like we did and then wonder what to do with this low quality machine and your deep disappointment. I know the reviews look mostly good on here (that's why I bought this thing!) but please!! Save yourself a lot of money, time, energy, and frustration and buy a notable brand like black and decker or something that you can send back stateside or get some actual help with, because if you get a faulty one of these, you'll have more problems than you started with.

RPTIO7YO4HG3H,"I have purchased re-manufactured ink toner cartridges many times in the past with no problems.  I print a few pages regularly - anywhere from maybe 10 to 30 pages a week.  I used this item regularly - and it seems to have stopped working even though my printer showed that my black ink cartridge was over 1/2 full.  It was printing so poorly that I couldn't even read the pages (it was very light and spotty).  I took it out and replaced it, did all the trouble shooting the printer offered, and tried it again - and it still didn't work.  (It also still read as being over 1/2 full - my printer always gives warnings when the ink is running low - and it was not low with this cartridge).  Besides not getting what I paid for, I also wasted a lot of time and  paper in the process of trying to get it to work.  The color ink seems to be okay so far.  I don't believe it dried up from not being used, as I do print on a regular basis - and the color ink still works (I print with both color and black regularly).This has soured me from buying re-manufactured in toner.  I really want to do what is best for the environment and, of course, save $$ - but I can't justify only getting 1/2 the printing when I am paying for the XL.  The problem was definitely not my printer - as i went out and bought the HP brand and now it's printing perfectly.  The only reason I am not giving one star is because it did print fine for a little while.",0,0

R320N4W3A6XHRK,"Simply awful product, it is difficult to cut with anything other than scissors. It will not tear worth a damn as it is aluded to on the packaging and don't even try a razor blade as it masticates the edges of the material. The ""perforations"" for easy ""tearing"" are just holes in the film you bought to block out the light that in fact allows light to permeate it. The ""static cling"" is more luck than magic.The 24"" wide roll is actually 23 1/2 inches and patching the pieces together looks awful. Don't even bother with this unless you have large flat non segmented windows. Any odd shapes, lengths or detail is a nightmare. If you don't want light to permeate the edges of the windows you have to overlap the edges of the window frames with the film rather than cutting it to the exact dimansions of the window. However doing this is both unattractive and prevents the product from properly clinging to the window. Also it may interfere with the movement and functioning of your windows. So rather than having an easy to take up and down static cling you have to tape the edges down and over lay them on the frames making your windows look like a kindergarden art project went horribly wrong and be semipermanent fixture.The material itself is very light weight and brittle so holes and cuts and rips happen quite easily. It took my wife and I three hours to cover three windows in this garbage and our windows only had two segments each. The only reason this gets two stars is it does block out a significant proportion of the light coming through the windows but at what cost?We wanted a temporary solution to cover the windows when we had shift work and to be taken down when we would like to use our windows. The only quality solution to this dilemma is blackout track blinds, but they are exceptionally expensive and have to be custom cut to each window. This seemed like the way to go, however now our windows are a mess and I don't ever want to go through trying to get them placed again even though they are cut. I will leave them up for now until I find a better solution but this is going in the trash at the earliest opportunity. Do not waste your money, before the next person makes this $50 mistake this horrible product should end up on the scrap heap of history.",0,0
R1UO9T9NFDDK2S,"On the plus side, when my scanner died a little AFTER the warranty ran out, the company sent me a new one very quickly, and paid all shipping to and from (for the return of the old one). They were very helpful. That's why this gets an extra star.But the quality of the scans with this is very bad, and the character recognition is almost non-existent. I just ran 10 receipts thru, of varying quality, and only ONE picked up the correct merchant name and transaction amount. Some just showed blank, and others had random stuff it picked up. None of the receipts were faded or illegible - I scanned a few into Evernote with my android phone and it picked them up, the OCR worked fine.I knew this wasn't a top of the line model when I bought it, but I was trying to save a bit. Bad move in this case. Maybe their larger models are better quality, but I think I'll save up and try one of the Fujitsu ScanSnap models next time.

Even if it's a machine-printed amount, it may not find the correct amount on the receipt.  It may, or may not, find the name of the issuer of the receipt.  In short, the user has to review EVERYTHING for accuracy, and do a lot of manual entry besides.  Furthermore, the ""upgrade"", I'd call it a ""sidegrade"", to version 5.1 is a hassle.  The new version of the software cannot directly read the previous backup file format (.nwbak), requiring a special migration process.

The quality of the cartridge itself was a problem as 2 of them broke after inserting them ( and I did insert them properly!) another huge problem was although I unwrapped them carefully and held them upside down so the area the ink actually comes out from was on top,while I took off the large plastic tab the ink still went everywhere.

R3BG1PHGF5MW69,"This is the second time I purchased this product.  The first time I did, I experienced streaking with the Cyan cartridge.  Nevertheless, I decided to give the vendor the benefit of the doubt because it still seemed like a good deal and I could tolerate the occasional streaks.  So, I purchased another 4-pack and I am now experiencing severe smudging with the Magenta toner on all prints.  At this point, purchasing this product is like playing a game of roulette with a sure bet of losing; it's just a matter of which color you want to place your bets on.UPDATE: I'm increasing my original rating from 2 stars to 4 to reflect good service. The vendor contacted me shortly after this review and offered a full 4-toner replacement st no charge.  They were very responsive throughout the process and checked back frequently to make sure I received and tested the product.  So far, the Magenta replacement is functioning as it should be.  I will update my review again once I make it through all four cartridges.UPDATE 10/16/2017--reduced rating to two stars:  So, I finally went through the remaining toner cartridges from the initial shipment, as well as the replacement, and the final verdict is that I will never purchase these again.  I have experienced issues with every cartridge I loaded.  The black toner seems to be the safest bet, but even those don't operate to the full 2500 page capacity based on printer stats.  I experienced streaking, smudges, and premature toner outages with all color cartridges.  The Yellow toner created light smudges along the left edge of all pages during its entire lifetime--including on BW prints; Blue toners always streaked, spotted, smudged, and seemed to run out the quickest; and the last new Magenta toner I loaded today registered only as half full.  My original review stands; it really is hit or miss, with most missing the mark.  2 stars, for at least, having decent customer service.",0,0

In addition, there is no way to calibrate the scanning function (and it needed it) since even the driver interface is different than the one described in the manual, although tech support said they might have a patch.Box is completely misleading  - reading it, you would think that if you have OS X you are good to go.

R2JUXNNLW1489A,"Granted, I ordered this cartridge over a year ago (May 2011 from the vendor JAMinnovations) for my HP Deskjet 845C and just now needed to install it.  The cartridge that was in my deskjet (purchased by the way from inkjetcartridges dot com) lasted over a year - printing about 12-20 pages per week.  It finally went dry, so I installed this one - figuring since it was a genuine HP cartridge in retail packaging (which it wasn't - it was a white box, busted open, with instructions stuck on the outside) that it would work great.  But maybe if it really was an original HP product, since they probably don't make these for this older printer, it was dried up long ago.  Anyway, I immediately ordered another cartridge from Amazon (OfficeMax Black Ink Cartridge Compatible with HP 15 (C6615DN) OM98673 Sold by Speedy Inks, $8.99).  It arrived today, I installed it & it works great!  It was packaged very well, is fresh, isn't an ""original"" HP cartridge, but I don't think that matters for these older printers.

R1T2FUR3KEMEVY,"Now that the device is out of warranty, I'm having nothing but problems. At first, it would go offline for hours at a time, even though my internet was working on all my other devices. About 2 weeks ago it stopped working all together, except for a few hours yesterday. I was on the phone (my cell) with custormer service last week for almost an hour before being transferred to someone who supposedly has more technical expertise. I was with the tech person for over an hour. They both had me trying the same things over and over again. I did tell them that I had already tried those things with no success. The tech person finally told me that the problem was in the device itself and that I needed to purchase another one. These days most electronics last for years. If this product has to be replaced every 1 or 2 years it must mean quality was not a concern when it was designed. I now have to decide if I want to fork out the money for another one and spend time searching for a price I can afford. My advice to anyone considering buying - it's good while it lasts, but that might be for a short time.UPDATE. I sent my Ooma phone number as instructed when the company replied to my review. I was supposed to be connected to Support. They have my email address. No one has contacted me.

Very limited capacity on the coin input slot; coins tend to fall out of the sorting barrel behind the sorting wheel. To clear it, you have to remove the top (there is a screw in the back) and turn the machin upside down.

The XL black ink cartridge didn't last half as long as just a standard HP cartridge, but that I can live with due to the price being much lower than authentic cartridges. When it came time for me to use the color cartridge it was around a year later, and I had kept it sealed in the box that it came in.

R2UJB7LC6FXY0D,"Sad that Amazon insists on combining reviews for unrelated products.  This review is for the one with the built-in gel wrist wrest MW85B.I have the matching wrist rest WR85B, so I thought I'd get this one.  The wrist wrest is OK.  This mouse pad is, however, garbage!For starters, it is not even close to being flat.  It is warped/dished, and the corners raise off my desk 1/8"" to 1/4"".  So, as you move the mouse around, it is flopping around as well.  This is a deal breaker for me.  I tried to flatten it out with no improvement whatsoever.Next, it is really too small.  Like the wrist wrest, the gel is quite hard, and, therefore, it's best to use it as a PALM rest.  Either way, it is too short.  From where your wrist wrests, the mouse goes off the top of the pad often.  Width-wise, it is OK.  Not generous, but OK.Additionally, it is a very scratchy/rough material for the mouse surface.  It feels like you are almost dragging your mouse on sandpaper.  It does not move easily, and, considering I am using a very expensive/precious Logitech MX Revolution mouse, I don't want it wearing the pads off.Finally, sort of a con, but these are not the ""satin pillow"" that 3M describes, but rather a firm (almost no give) gel/rubber with a matte soft-touch vinyl cover much like you might see on some automotive surfaces.In sum, the wrist wrest is OK, but the mouse pad version is terrible.",0,0

I used goo gone, adhesive remover and rubbing alcohol with a razor blade. If I could I'd give it 0 stars. A complete waste of time and money. I am SO unhappy.",1,1

Okay, great... now, for the real test. I did a printer head cleaning, ran a test page. Not great, didn’t look like it was giving me any ink from the gray and black tanks I had replaced. Next, tried printing return labels (regular paper, bar code label printing like we used to have to do for Amazon returns) for stuff I needed to send out. Major fail—the bar codes were missing data, the print quality was crap. I tried repeating with color vs b/w, no improvement. Wasted a lot of OEM color ink trying to troubleshoot this mess. Finally realized that the one-star reviews had it right; I’m not a high end user, wasn’t trying to print photo quality or anything. Just wanted to print a darned shipping return label or three.

R2Y3QINAHJD5JN,"Review menu iconThe WORST service for businessesjust nowIf you need or expect service that works reliably and dependably, this is not the company for you.  I own several franchises and this was the biggest mistake I’ve made since going in business.  They complete about 1 in 4 calls successfully and have no way to open a ticket with a technical team to resolve the issue.  It has cost me so much in lost revenue and they are a complete nightmare to deal with.  No desire to even have a person support and resolve the issue.  Try to open a trouble ticket before ordering the service, you’ll see what I mean.  Every day there’s a message that says they have an outage and are experiencing technical issues, after sitting on hold and reaching one of the front line people, you’ll get no where, because they just take your name and number, then they will tell you they are escalating, but they don’t.  What will you do when an employee needs to call 911 and the service doesn’t work?  If you are reading this because you are experiencing a similar issue, file a complaint with the fcc.

R1XKL0CDCXBFIS,"I've tried all different brands and sizes of scissors, and carefully followed the extremely easy and simple instructions, and it won't sharpen any of them. And worse (I guess?), if you're not careful when you're pulling your scissors out, you'll cut and damage the cheap plastic on either side of the sharpening area essentially slowly cutting the device in half. I wasn't expecting military-grade for the price but I at least expected it to do the simple task it is advertised as doing. I dislike giving negative reviews and less than 4 or 5 stars, but I've been having a terrible run with products purchased through Amazon lately. Perhaps Amazon should practice a little more quality control with the vendors they allow to sell through their good name and the products those vendors sell. Maybe it's just a Winter curse and things will go back to the old, reliable Amazon that I've relied on and loved for 15+ years. I really wish this device would work for me in some capacity and would sharpen, well, anything, so I could give it 2 or 3 stars; it is what it is though, unfortunately. About the only positive things I have to say, besides the instructions being simple (although to a futile end), is that it was shipped to me quickly and packaged as expected. I don't have any reason to think that the seller was trying to be dishonest or fraudulent, just that an item they sell doesn't work for me. If anyone has any tips or ideas that would help me, although the instructions are foolproof enough, I would love to be proven totally wrong. I guess granny will continue to cut her quilting cloth with dull scissors until I can find a sharpener that will get the job done.",0,0
RI6JRTTRNPC6K,"I purchased this mouse board to replace my Rocket Fish Aluminum dual sided mouse board. I do NOT use this for gaming, it's used for precision mouse function of Design/3D building programs. The Rocket Fish surface coating was becoming worn smooth from several years of use with a Logitech M705 Laser Mouse (my mouse of choice). I'm not one for change, so if I find something I like that works well, I stick with it and re-purchase another one when it's time. I was impressed by the ad presentation and claims of the RUDE-220 so I tried one.Upon receiving the RUDE-220, I couldn't help but notice that the rugged packaging was very well designed with considerable thought, very professional. After opening the package, I discovered that the 'FREE! Teflon Mouse Skates' were missing. Missing Teflon mouse strips aside, I still couldn't wait to try this thing out. The first thing I did was to wipe down the new board with some LCD screen/lens cleaner to remove any residue from the surface.The board is very nicely constructed with a fully bonded, non-skid rubber back over the entire area, not just 4 rubber feet as with similar boards. The mouse surface is completely bonded to the metal core which provides for extreme durability. Noticing that the metal core has been fabricated with radiused edges, gives a nice finished appearance with no sharp edges. I also discovered that this particular board is 'crowned' (curved/bowed) top to bottom, which means that the board does not sit perfectly flat on my desk, with a slight gap on the bottom. Because this 'crown' is so slight, performance of the board should not be affected.After taking the Logitech M705 mouse for a test drive on the new mouse board, I was very disappointed. There was no smooth mouse movement on the 'super slick' surface' as I expected. In fact, I experienced a heavy drag with the mouse on this board. The board's surface feels quite coarse and grainy to the touch, not at all like the 'super slick' surface' that is claimed by the product hype. Based on 35 years plus in the computer field, I feel the performance of this product has left me asking this puzzling question: Exactly what is it that makes this mouse board so special?In conclusion: It's very possible that performance could be enhanced by the 'Teflon Mouse Skates' that were omitted from my package. However, until I can verify this with the proper Teflon strips provided by Rude Gameware (seller), it is only a possible solution at best. Until then, I may be breaking out my old Rocket Fish mouse board, which has a much smoother and slicker surface.UPDATE 12/21/14: I have continued to use the board since posting my review and have found that the mouse surface seems to be getting smoother with use. Although I'm somewhat skeptical about thesurface improvement in such a short period of time, it is now far better than when I first posted results, which was yesterday 12/20/14.I will post further updates on surface performance as necessary.UPDATE 1/2/15: The tracking surface of this board has improved greatly and is now the accurate and smooth surface that I expected it to be. I'm still puzzled as to why the 'break in time' was required to 'smooth out the wrinkles'.Mel",0,0

REVZIKISIO9BA,"The product is okay, half the holes needed to put this thing together were not drilled out. The back doesn't match the rest of the item, the back of the item and the bottoms of the drawers have to be nailed in, but the nails are flimsy and the board is so thick it is borderline impossible to hammer through without injury. In fact,  I ended up using a nail gun. Assembly is unnecessarily difficult, and also doesn't make any sense. For example, why do I have to nail in the bottom composite board to the drawer when you went through the trouble of boring out a track to slide it in on 3 sides of the drawer, but not the back???Then, after all was said and done, AFTER it was assembled, I realized there is a huge scratch on the top. Overall, crappy experience. Sure it's mostly made of real wood, but it was incomplete and nonsensical to assemble. At this point, it's done so I can't even send it back, but if I could, I would.I should have just ordered something from office depot.

R1CGFWPOK0JLR4,"I just got this pen today, and I have to say that i'm not particularly impressed by it. The pen and ink flow is good, but my problem is with the stylus end. They really should have gone with a twist open instead of needing to push down on the stylus to use the pen, because it feels really awkward pushing on the hollow rubber stylus. I imagine the stylus won't last long under the stress of pushing my thumb down on it whenever I need to use the pen. On the other hand, the stylus functions perfectly on my iphone screen.UPDATE: Within 2 weeks of owning this pen and hardly using it, it no longer works. When I click on the pen to open it, it stays stuck and won't go back unless I force it to. Really bad quality and really disappointed. As I said in my original review, the design for this pen is horrible. If you are looking for a stylus pen combo that blows this one away search on Amazon for ""iDream365 stylus pen"", not only does it come with 2 pens and refills, it is cheaper, the design and quality is much better and it takes Parker pen refills.

R2MXDQYI3NVHIV,"Well, Looks like I should of forked out the extra money for the new one, since I have had to get a replacement already! Received it in time but when I hooked it up, no go! The premise is nice, receive a discounted rate for a ""Certified Refurbished"" unit, but only if it WORKS! I would have rather spent the last 2 hours that I have spent on the phone with Ooma customer service, tech support and escalation reps, at the DENTIST or even outside. The money saved is not worth the hassle of what I went through to get one that actually works. Not only was the ethernet cable provided broken, but the port itself is blown. I would like to think that quality assurance would check these units BEFORE they ship and that mine just HAPPENED to miss EVERY quality check, but this sure steers me away from buying another refurb product period.Granted, Ooma is replacing a new unit for this one, so while troubleshooting this with them they did provide a replacement so I did not have to contact the seller, even though I did, but the amount of time spent getting a replacement is not worth it for this customer.  I still have to make a call back to Ooma to get credit for the time I have been unable to use this product when I ACTUALLY get a working one, since you have to sign up BEFORE you activate, so essentially I am in the hole with this purchase.

R1TDEW7L7OC2TE,"I’m getting suspicious of all these Amazon products with “paid reviews”.Here’s a non-paid review. I decided to bite and try the product. Only cause I needed just ONE of these things (versus buying in bulk) and bought based on price.The product is made of extremely thin and cheap plastic. This thing can hold one sheet of paper, max.Because of the thinness of the plastic, it’s not surprising that a high probability of these came broken (for proof, read other reviews). Mine came broken.This thing feels like it was made for 5 cents (if that) and is being sold for $6.62 (at the time I bought it). That’s a HUGE return on such a cheap product.Conclusion? If you just need one like I did, better to go to your in-person box store and just buy one. Sure, you’ll pay about $3 more, but the plastic quality will be better, and you can guarantee yourself you won’t get a broken one.I guess this is part of a new business strategy where you mass produce a cheap product, give some away free to get a bunch of positive reviews to get the internet version of “shelf space” — i.e. higher placement in search rankings, and based off that placement, hook enough people to buy your product to make it worth your while. It’s like infomercials.Based on this experience, I would trust products that DIDN’T have paid reviews. Buyer beware.Addendums:- About the positive paid reviews: I’m sure if you got something for FREE (no risk to you at all), of course you would be nice about it. And I’m sure they made SURE the reviewers didn’t get broken products. I’m sure it cost them barely anything to give away free 5 cent products to buy people’s time to improve search page rankings.- I would be more forgiving if this product was half the price (being generous). I would be even more patient if it was a dollar. Then I could say, “Well, you get what you paid for”. But this product is EXTREMELY OVERPRICED FOR THE QUALITY.Last addendum: As I'm writing this review, the price has jumped up to $13 for ONE?? TOTAL RIPOFF. DO NOT BUY.",0,0

Also, they seem a big flimsy and I continually have to rescrew the bottom in to hold the ink in place.

RJ9VF9LO5V86H,"I wavered between one and two stars, ultimately choosing two because it does work.The main issue I am having is that the right side of all my papers has horrid black toner spots/ streaks/ melted toner.

RKP98MY1JK67S,"As I sit here comparing my 2015 and (new) 2016 Moleskine Weekly Notebooks, there are two quite disappointing and unnecessary changes introduced for 2016:First, the eminently useful, vertical annual planning calendars in the front of the notebook - which allowed one to plan for four months at a time over two years - have been replaced by very conventional single-page mini monthly calendars, which are actually a disadvantage for planning purposes, and seem to miss the entire point about annual planning. What's more, there were TWO years of the previous vertical planning calendars, which (apparently to save page counts and production costs?) have been replaced by only ONE year of these stupid blocky monthly calendars. So there's no longer any place to jot in your plans for the next year, which is this case would be 2017. It seems like a whimsical decision by Moleskine, and at least for me (I do plan events and deadlines months and even years in advance), this really detracts from the previous usefulness of this product. Very disappointing.Second, the very nice typography of previous years has been replaced with a rather heavyset type which draws attention to itself on every page. Again, it seems a rather whimsical and counterproductive design decision. Very much an anti-Moleskine decision. (It's kind of like putting sharp edges on an iPhone, and I don't even own an iPhone but can understand the aesthetic appeal).I can't put my finger on all of the things that are wrong about this ""new and improved"" 2016 Moleskine Weekly Notebook, but there are several beyond those already mentioned.I've been using various Moleskine since before they were popular (10+ years?) and they obviously have a new designer who has made some very poor decisions. At this rate they are on track to join the unpleasant muck of the dozen other ""popular"" planners, most of which are detestable.",0,0

RJFL9ZUBH6F6A,"Edit: Changing my review from 4 to 2 stars. After several days of using the pen, it has become less and less reliable to the point that now, to write at all, I have to hold it at a 90-degree angle from the paper, or even upside down on the top of the nib. Also, comparing it to the V-301 Black fountain pen I bought only a few days before, the nib tip seems larger, which explains while it doesn't really achieve the ""fine point"" it's labeled as. I think I'm going to have to give up on this one. The black one is doing fine. They should be identical, so I'm not sure if this one is a lemon or it's a consistent design or manufacturing flaw.For the price, I like this pen a lot so far. It seems sturdy and writes well. It was a little difficult to get the ink started, but after rinsing the nib under the tap, I got the ink started and the pen writes smoothly. My only issue is that it's supposed to be a fine point but I find that it's writing thicker than any other pen I've used, fine or not It's almost like a marker!

R3LB57G85XUI6V,"When I first tried the stapler, I used about 50 magazine pages as a test. The stapler jammed. It continued to jam each time I tried it with anything, even when I was down to two pages. I called ACCO customer support, and after describing the issue they told me to return it or exchange it. I opted to return it. Although it's possible that mine was an exception, the part that the staples come out of was not properly aligned with the recess on the bottom plate, leaving nothing to get the staple to bend on the bottom.A positive point is that it comes with a lifetime guarantee against jamming when used with the correct (included) staples. I can't say how likely it is to jam, but if yours stops working after a while, you always have the option of calling customer service. They answered on the first ring, which is a plus.You might also consider the  PaperPro 60-Sheet High-Capacity Stapler (1200) , which has a capacity of fewer sheets (60) but works reliably and with very little force.

Carriage would not come back to center and I kept getting error codes 5100 and 6000.  After two hours searching the internet I found a way to get the carriage back to the center so I could remove the defective ink cartridges.  This is what worked:  Open top of printer as if you were going to scan.  Plug in printer, turn printer on by pressing power, have cover of ink area access open as printer prepares to print.  Watch carriage travel and when it reaches center, unplug the power cord.  You can now access and remove the bad cartridges.  Replace with good cartridges and start printer as normal.  Printer working, error codes gone.I thought I had broken my printer which is less than one year old.  It appeared that the bad cartridges could not be removed and the error codes could not be resolved.  These ink cartridges are unusable for a MX922.  I hope the seller reads their reviews and refunds my purchase price.  These cartridges wasted my time and money and I am grateful I found a way to get them out.",0,0

R1W3GF115GNZI4,"I REALLY wanted to like this scale. But when it arrived I put in the battery and tried and when it produced the 0.00 weight I put several varying weight items on it and it still read 0.00. I tried plugged in with the AC only. Same issue. Tried both battery and AC adapter... still no weighing. Then randomly I start getting ""Err"" reading on it. Of course this isn't listed in their very small ""troubleshoot your equipment"" insert, and even my Google-fu couldn't find the solution. Fiddled with it for hours and sometime the ""Err"" would go away, but still no registering of weight.Bottom line: Just invest in the $25 or $50 version of a scale through the post office. I now am out of money while I wait for it to return and now need to wait for the new scale to arrive. Small business with no easy at home shipping options? Very upset. The only upside was the product was packaged very well, otherwise it was a total bust. It wasn't even worth contacting the manufacturer, if I'm having these issues right out of the box, I can't even imagine what it would be like down the road. I should have listened to the other negative reviews, but I'm an optimist. This time it didn't pan out. Please shop around and make sure you buy the proper scale for your needs.

RXYEJYM93EDCB,"If I could rate this a ZERO, I would.  I have a graduate degree in computer science and more than 40 years experience in computer imaging systems.  While this device is fast and the image quality is ""ok"" the programming and documentation are terrible.  There is a USB connection to power the device and allow you to copy files to your PC. However, it appears that the first images you scan get stored in internal memory.  After scanning about 200 slides, I copied them to my PC over the USB connection.  Next day I scanned another 200 slides and copied them over the USB connection as well -- or, rather, I thought I copied them.  Turns out it copied the first ~90 slides I scanned the day before (but had subsequently deleted from the memory card), probably copying them from internal memory, instead of copying the first ~90 slides I scanned that 2nd day, but also copied the remaining 110  files.  Stupid me didn't check every single slide but just the last few to be sure I got all of them.  I deleted those files from the SD card and repeated this process for 4 days, today being the 4th, when I discovered that nearly 400 of the 800 files I scanned were not present on my PC, but rather 4 copies of the first 90 slides I scanned, plus any additional slides I happened to scan on those days.  Fortunately, I copied each day's work to a separate directory, so I still have about 1/2 the files I scanned.  The bad news is the numbering overlaps so I can't just combine them into a directory without renaming every file.  I contacted DigitNow customer service to see how I could resent the starting number for the next batch of slides, but it cannot be changed!  This is the WORST programming I've ever encountered.

R3MVLZS5QJMCD2,"I bought these cartridges because of the good reviews. I don't print a lot but after a few printings I started to have a black line from top to bottom on each page, on the right...a little bit later I started to have the black line and lots of yellow lines (on the left side of the page). I had to print some official documents so that was very annoying. I replaced the black cartridge (which is not empty!) with a black HP and the line disappeared. Unfortunately I still have the yellow lines so I guess I have now to replace all the cartridges (and they are still almost full). I cleaned several times my printer (in case of) but it didn't change anything. So I had to go make print my documents to another place!So yes it's cheaper but it's only good for a perfect printing for a few times (I have a HP laserjet Pro 200 color).I prefer to pay more at HP and never have an issue with my printing and at least use them until they are empty.",0,0

R2L190R9UISEEN,"Updated review. I literally just posted my raving review then used it, well more like tried to use it, and it broke off into bits. I just tapped it down and that was it, 4 bits of metal came off and the spring and it no longer works.This product works veery well and extremely sturdy. The only drawback I can think of is that the screws are visible. If  it had come with  a cover then this item would be more aesthetically pleasing. It came with screws that has the drill bit on the end to drill through metal/wood so you don't need a drill to install this. It works very well and  you can easily operate it with no hands. It is just attached to a spring so when you step on it, it will draw up the kick stand. I would definitely purchase this again if I need a kick stand doorstop. Best I have used  since I don't need to bend over and dirty my hand to use it.",0,0

On the initial attempt, the first staple was mangled, became stuck, and nearly impossible to remove.  I remain in such disbelief at the inferior quality of this Swingline Optima 70 Desk Stapler, that I went online to search for more reviews (something I know should have done prior to purchase, but I erroneously trusted the brand).  It seems that I am far from alone in my disappointment and dissatisfaction.  Please do not confuse this unit with the other lower-capacity sheet Optima reviews.  This 70 model is WORTHLESS!

It will be different for each printer (I am trying to give them the benefit of the doubt here, but seriously they are ripping people off). In my case for all 3 color cartridges and a black cartridge in my HP6970 I get about 50-60 pages, and I rarely use color at all, I try to totally avoid it. The cost per page for me is roughly $1 a page (I should say was I am not going to use HP anymore you may not when you read the following, to see his actual chart you will need to go to the following link (assuming Amazon leaves it intact).https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Printing-Errors-or-Lights-Stuck-Print-Jobs/NEW-HP-2135-PRINTER-DOES-NOT-PRINT-MORE-THAN-30-PAGES-PER/td-p/6295623Here is the text of the reply from UNIXPLUS:""Here is a chart to help with Ink Cartridge Page Estimation.  All cartridges are based on a 5% coverage when new.Note:  A 5% coverage is about 6 single spaced lines of text on a page. No bold, graphics or pictures.  A full color photo would be 100% coverage.A ‘regular’ page of text would be about 72 lines and give us 30% coverage (more realistic).  Don’t forget the font type and size you use will use more ink too.Example: 564 Standard Black = 250 pages at 5% coverage.Let’s say your average page coverage you estimate is 30%.  So…250/6 = 41.Therefore the number of pages expected (30% coverage) out of your cartridge would be about 40 pages.A 564 Standard Color (300 pages) at 100% coverage yields – 300/20 = 15 pages.""Each printer manufacturer will be different, but look to see if you can find something like the above or actual reviews that talk about how many real world pages they actually get/print. To me this feels like false advertising as they often talk about cost per page in the 20 cents or less area, not my experience over 3 printers and replacement HP cartridges. I thought my kids were doing stuff and not telling me but looking at the page counts and finding that page at an HP forum totally hits the nail on the head. That being said as I have covered this has happened with 3 different printers I have had over the last 5 years, I thought the issues were on my end. I guess if you consider they don't openly seem to share the math of how their cartridges work on any of their advertising, it is my fault for not digging much deeper. Do yourself a favor and find a different printer manufacturer that actually prints more than 50-60 pages of typical black full page text pages, unless you love HP and don't mind spending close to a buck a page.",0,0

RKI0FP6I9GZXV,Like all other reviews the instructions are bad at best and them taping washers inside the box and not with the rest of the hardware is just bizarre.  After the chair was put together it is a good chair. My problem is after about 6months the chair will now not stay at its highest position once you sit on it.  Over about 3-5mins the chair slowly ratchets down until it hits the bottom and then you have to re raise the chair.  It appears to be getting worse and worse.  I have had this happen with other chairs and figured it was due to the weight limit.  This chair has a 330lb weight limit which I am 280lbs so no reason it shouldn't be able to support my weight. Its a great chair when it stays up but it is really frustrating when you feel it start to drop.,0,0

RCOS88HOUFPKQ,"I probably should have paid more attention to reviews, but I had a table like this before as a rolling nightstand. My biggest concerns were the caster wheels, which are actually quite good themselves. Since I'm on carpet, leveling issues aren't noticeable but as others said, a few washers or a thin leveling nut will fix that.The stand itself is good steel tubing and pretty stable, so my biggest concern windows down to the actual ""countertop"" and the fact that it is cut into 3 parts to make the flat-pack more efficient for shipping. There can be no other possible reason they would do this. This creates an inconsistency in manufacturing where after assembling the pieces, they are not flush across the gaps of the joins. When you buy this as a laptop stand, this becomes a major irritant when trying to use a mouse because the crack jutting up catches the edge of the mouse and starts scratching the teflon mouse skates that make the mouse easy to slide.

These bad reviews go back a year and they are still selling this crap without fixing it. The design must have done by a first grader. I have bought Mr. Penn items before and been happy with them but by continuing to sell this knowing it is bad for a year without fixing it is just poor business practice. Will never buy this item or anything else by Mr. Penn again.,0,0
R34HWY22VXD5VH,"So I bought a 50pc pack of these 2 mil Mylar Silver Era. Not enough for my collection, but I wanted to ensure they fit and are good before I buy more. Yes, 38 Singapore Dollar for 50 pc is pretty expensive for what it is. Thin plastic pockets.They fit nicely for my Swedish comics from 70s and 80s. Great.Decided to buy enough to cover my complete collection. Only to discover price has gone from 38 SGD to 62 SGD within 2 days.Buy more of these on Amazon? I don't think so.Good pockets. Insane pricing. The 1 star is for the pricing.Update March 2022: Looks like price has gone back to SGD38. Good call.",0,0
RCBOS6LM4LQ5T,"Purchased as a hopeful alternative to a landline. It didn't work for my purposes, the latency (lag) was too much...almost a 1 second delay of when you spoke to when they heard you.  So we decided it wasn't for us.  No problem, and with that I would have given it 3 stars as it did most of what it said it was going to do.My issue is with the customer service afterwards.  I actually purchased this Ooma over a year ago.  I'm still getting calls from them (even today) telling me they need to update my info, or my service, etc.  I've told them to cancel my service and quit calling me probably a half dozen times.  Each time they nicely say ok, then go through a script of countless reasons I should keep my service or at the very least try to gift my Ooma to a friend (it's been in the trash for months).And each time it turns out that...no...they still have me as an active customer. They keep emailing me (even though I opt out), they keep calling me, they never stop.  I now just hang up on them because the simple act of helping me is not their primary motive at all.",0,0
R14EBNUWKOWQDM,"I am extremely disappointed in this product. My boys were so excited to earn their stars when this package arrived. We sat down, talked about what chores we would all agree on, what our star rewards would be, and who was represented by each star. Then I realized the magnets were not attached to the board. I attached them specifically following the instructions, only to place the board on the refrigerator and have it come crashing down to the floor. The magnets extend past the frame and definitely are all four touching the refrigerator. They are placed exactly as directed in the diagram and the weight is balanced. These magnets simply are not strong enough for this product. They don't work whatsoever. Now I will have to damage the board to remove them and make a special trip to Office Max to find replacement magnets that work. What was the point of purchasing this board and having it shipped to my home if I now have a board that I can't use, disappointed children, and need to go hunt around town for replacement magnets. Very unhappy with this product. I expected better from this manufacturer. Dont ruin your board and attach these magnets if you purchase this item.",0,0
R38ACQDNWMMGGX,I should have read the reviews. I paid 4 buck for four erasers. There are supposed to be 5 in each tube. Knew I should have just bought them at the store. Save yourselves the hassle. Find them in a store and pay less for more product.,0,0
R2KTOOCWCIRWF2,"I staple quite a bit at work, going through a couple lines of staples each week.  I burned through a lot of cheap staplers before finally ordering some better ones.The last couple years, I've used a  PaperPro Desktop Stapler, Black/Gray (1100) .  It was able to get through 25+ sheets easily and consistently with almost no effort.  Downside was a loud click/bang noise which was distracting in the office.  After quite a bit of use, the stapler broke and would no longer attempt to staple anything.I ordered this Swingline Optima 40 because it was meant for heavy duty use, could staple more sheets, and would staple them flat.  I've used it for a couple months with the recommended Optima staples and it's just not very good.First, the stapler can't get through much more than 25 sheets.  Definitely can't staple as much as the PaperPro, even though that was a cheaper light duty model.Second, the staple punches through quite a bit when using fewer than 5 sheets.  Often the back of the staple will come through the top page, sometimes all the way.  Other times, the staple won't lay flat or fails to staple at all.Third, the stapler can't accept a full line of staples.  Neither could the PaperPro, but these staples are specifically designed for the Optima.  You either have to try and break off the last 10 staples or break the staples in half.  It's annoying either way.On the plus side, it's built like a tank and when it works, flat staples are great.It might be silly to nitpick a stapler, but then again, you're reading a stapler review.I'll be ordering a  PaperPro Prodigy Stapler, Black/Silver (1110)  as I like the performance and can live with the bang noise.",0,0

R2HMGKIL367SIU,"With two kids, having to sharpen pencils and colours every second day took a lot of time so was on a look out for a good electric helical pencil sharpener that grinds your pencil instead of shaving it. The latter I found kept cutting up the soft wood in a lot of the colours and fancy pencils the kids wanted.It was great for about 8 months but one day it just wouldn't sharpen the pencils,  the blade was sharp, put new batteries in still no luck. Amazon have offered to replace it so 5 stars for the service thereI have gone with the same sharpener as until this point it worked well.Things to be aware - It can be noisyRechargeable batteries go flat quickly, I now use them with normal batteries. I didn't try it with the hybrid low discharge batteries.Batteries can be a pain to put in as the cover is very tight and it was difficult to see the polarityI would love a sharper that has both battery and mains one together and can deal with different sizes pencils, but either they are very expensive or the reviews have not been great.One I did consider was Jakar Electric Pencil Sharpener - Model 5151 which has good reviews, but is twice the price and heavier.UpdateAfter having two more items replaced as they didnt work.

R2C38CE0GHIZ79,"If you don't follow the instructions exactly, the ink will spew all over the place damaging everything in sight; this has now happened to me twice; I now enter into the bathroom and open the cartridge inside the garbage can just in case. I always do step 1 then step 2-- but apparently I have twice not executed this correctly (perhaps my finger was covering something- there are details on the box about what not to do). I know it is my fault if I don't follow instructions on the box carefully, but I have never had to read instructions on any other printer cartridge installation for any of my other printers over the years for a successful cartridge install. Perhaps they can spend a few more minutes designing an ink cartridge that is more failproof for someone in a rush who simply needs to open the cartridge, pop it in, and go. I'm giving one star because the cartridge should be more failproof -- again, I have NEVER had cartridges explode from any other cartridge system, so that seems to me part my fault (yes) but part the fault of their design team.

Every time I change direction in my chair, these annoying wheels stubbornly resist, and I must exercise extra force to move the chair just a few inches. I weigh 155 lbs, so it's not a weight problem.  It's a wheel problem!  I don't understand the rave reviews.  I am ordering a different design altogether.  The original wheels I had on this chair worked for years, they were just a little low, an inch lower to be exact.

I'm a watercolor artist, I knew markers vs paint would be an adjustment but I had used watercolor pencil and loved them, so I thought the markers would be a cool addition to what I already had and thought to use in my sketchbook and fun to have to carry around.In my opinion they don't work. I've tried them on a variety of papers, even bought Arteza papers because I thought they would possibly made a difference. All to no avail. The pigment is hard to distribute and dilute. The colors end up blotchy and uneven. Also some of the markers started to run after just 3 drawings.The water marker provided is way too soft.Very disappointed.",0,0

I used a plain black ball point pen ( not even my nice planner pens which would have been a catastrophe)Each day/night etc. has another on the other side. It bleeds straight through making the next day/week etc. illegible.2.  Poor quality.  Within a few moments the spine totally separated from the planner.3. Confusing set up- days- weeks- months Are all in separate areas leaving you to have to flip through pages and pages to find each area. It makes no sense. It takes more time when this is supposed to INCREASE productivity. I have no use for this. Perhaps, I got a faulty planner.  ( I sure hope so since I saw mainly glowing reviews) For the price, a regular pen should not bleed through the pages  nor should the cover have totally detached from the spine in only minutes.I’m also hoping the company contacts me to let me know if this is a faulty planner.

R8LCLEIIIPGGA,"I have this printer for over five years in my home office, printed less than 10,000 pages so far. It is a solidly made machine and prints at extremely high quality. However, there are two problems. First, it is expensive to operate. Many businesses use the Xerox service where they pay per page, which is not a viable option for a home office. Second, it developed a 'phantom paper jam' problem, where it continuously tells you to open this door and that tray and refuses to print until some hidden gremlin inside decides it gave you sufficient amounts of crap and then it prints. It's a common problem and many isers have been complaining about it for years. FIX THE DAMN FIRMWARE, XEROX, OR I AIN'T BUYING NOTHING FROM YOU EFER AGAIN.I reduced the rating to one star.

RP2B2TCAIAJBO,"The following 4-star paragraph, written in January 2012,  has been edited into past tense to reflect both this product's potential and its incredibly short lifespan:This little bitty stapler had a lot going for it: Came with its own little box of 1,000 green-colored staples that fit all standard-size staplers.  Came in two very loud colors so that,  tiny though it was, it would have been easy to find on even the messiest desk. Plus which, it came with a key chain attached.  And attached to the key chain was a belt hook, which I hooked onto my pencil jar, making it easy to find amid clutter.  I'd have much preferred to choose my own color combination from Swingline's pretty good selection; would have gladly paid a buck or two more if given that option, especially since the one they sent me is yellow & orange, which would have been my absolute last choice had I had one. Also, it arrived from the Amazon outside seller just a couple of days after I ordered it.UPDATE 3/2/12:  Quit working after 30 days. Spent two days trying to get it to release a staple. Couldn't do it. So came back here and deducted two of its original four stars. And then discovered I was not alone in all this. Ah, well. You get what you pay for, I guess.

It is not so much its “ballpoint” technology, the ink is REALLY LIGHT. The ink is dispensed from this pen as if it were OLD-OLD-OLD, or just a cheap product.As a student there is a valid need fir a multi-colored pen. It would be better if said pen were gel, but I’ve used a few ballpoints a time or two and THIS PEN WHICH I PURCHASED YESTERDAY IS CRAPPY.Bic,By now, your firm should have surpassed expectations in the manufacturing of writing tools. Unfortunately, that does not appear to be the case. Some advise: perfect you classic models, the ones that have been around for decades, or transition to manufacturing anything else. At least this way, you can claim to be “new” to the industry.And if it was too difficult to follow, besides the blue ink (which is also weak) all three other colors( (red, green and black) require pressing down firmly or retracing each stroke in order to be properly read—BIC= YOU CAN DO MUCH BETTER THAN THIS NONSENSE.CONSUMER: I’ve tried the pilot version and it comes with a .5 size line.

If you apply ANY pressure the lead and metal pin slide back up into the body of the compass, leaving you without a point to anchor the compass or anything to mark the circle.

RKBMHJF3OPGR3,"UPDATE:  I was happy with this pencil -- I purchased a total of 3.  When the lead ran out, I tried Pentel Super hi-Polymer Leads (HB, H, and 2H) and found it doesn't work--it slides back up inside.  I tried a piece of lead which was working (gripping) in my Alvin Draft/Matic DM03.  I put it in the Alvin DR03, and again, the lead slid up inside despite working fine in the non-retractable DM03.  I tried this with all three Alvin DR03's, and all fail to ""grip"" standard 0.3mm lead that works fine with other pencils.  I have ordered  Faber-Castell 0.35mm lead and Pentel Ain Stein Leads, and will try those.  But a 0.3mm pencil should work with all standard leads.  So far, this pencil only works with the lead it came with -- one and done.  Great pencil, but it should not be ""one and done"" disposable.----- Old review below -----This simple blue pencil is my #1 pencil because 0.3mm is always sharp, the tip holds the lead well and dispenses it evenly, the rubber grip feels comfortable.  But other 0.3mm pencils to that as well.  What makes this pencil stand out is the retractable tip.  If you drop this pencil, you won't destroy the fine tip and lose your $10 pencil.",0,0

RT5NJNWKF7RUK,Read so many great reviews I was excited to get this pencil. First of all it is shorter than I realized. It comes in a cheap plastic case not sealed like it is new. The weight is good but it is so slippery it is hard to hold onto. Maybe it is my hand size and arthritic thumb. It doesn't have an eraser built in somehow I missed that.

R2Y0CUVQU0FB7C,"I have really had a lot of trouble with staplers over the years. Just like anyone in an office, and staplers that don't work is one of the most frustrating things.For a while I gave up on these more expensive type, because they seemed to break just as easily. I bought the cheap $5 kind, and but decided to try this one because it was supposedly able to staple up to 40 pages with regular staples. Which seemed great, unless you staple large documents on a daily basis, buy extra large staples is a hassle especially for a small family business.When i first bought this stapler I wrote a review that said ""I am very impressed with how well this stapler is working and will continue to work. The stapler it self is heavy, though it doesn't require much effort to staple."" That was in August of 2014, it is now  January of 2015 and I am on the hunt for a new stapler.This stapler barely lasted 6 months, which is around $5 per month. The stapler is now bending on the right side of the staple and not going through the paper properly. Moreover it now feels stuck when attempting to staple.Not worth the money, the $5 staplers would have lasted almost as long for 1/6 of the price.I really want a stapler that just works, that I don't have to worry with replacing often.",0,0

R358ZGE0QCGUTM,"I had previously purchase coin cases like these listed at 26mm for my Arkham Horror card game, and they worked great, but I needed more for my D6 board game. I bought these because they were listed at the same size and I saw someone else picked them up with the Arkham Horror game, as well as the high review score, so I figured they were good to go.No dice. The packaging definitely says 26mm, but as can be seen in the pictures, they are far too large. The internal diameter of the new ones is 30mm, as compared to the 26mm diameter of my old ones (from a different company), measured with my caliper.These would be fine if they were the correct size, but they aren't, and it seems like it's not a mix-up of sending the wrong one since the sticker indicates they should be 26mm. The only saving grace is that they were only $7, but that's still $7 wasted unless I find something that's about 30mm to use them with. I guess they did come in a nice case I might find a use for....These are the ones I had bought previously (smaller ones pictured), which I avoided since they are now more than double the cost of the ones I recently bought.https://www.amazon.com/PRESIDENTIAL-Direct-Fit-Airtight-Capsule-Holder/dp/B01H28MP3M/ref=sr_1_29?dchild=1&keywords=26mm+coin+case+50&qid=1596758679&sr=8-29",0,0

R1WEQDCML4BE1Y,"If you’re after the short, down and dirty version, here it is…This program is a complete waste of time and energy.Now, for the actual review.If you’re after a simple GPS or mapping program, others are freely available.  And this program is about as far from “simple” as any software I’ve ever written, reviewed, tested, or even seen.  It’s “EZ Nav Route Wizard” is their sad attempt at providing a simpler interface by bypassing most of their ""features"", but it’s power is nil.  If you want simple directions from one place to another, that’s their way of giving it to you.  However, I’m baffled by why, if that’s what you’re after, you’re even considering this.  What DeLorme should have done, instead of wasting time developing a goofy simplistic option like this and sticking it in their ridiculously bulky and inefficient program is spend some time and effort simplifying the entire thing.  Imagine the control panel/dashboard of a 777 jetliner, with a seemingly infinite array of stuff, and a button in the middle that says “Fly to Chicago”.  Yeah, nice idea DeLorme.  Why not just make the thing easier to fly?  See, the bottom line is none of us is trying to fly a jetliner, we’re just trying to drive to a few places as quickly, easily and efficiently as possible, and we don’t need the dash of a 777 to do it.If, like many people who were abandoned by Microsoft when they stopped producing Streets & Trips even though it was consistently rated #1, you’re looking for a program that serves as a GPS and a routing program, DELORME STREET ATLAS IS NOT IT.  This program has extremely limited power in this regard – so much so that there’s no way to include it in that category.  If you, for instance, have a round trip to plan, where you know your start and end points, and have multiple stops to make but aren’t sure what order to put them in, or lets say you’re a service technician or salesman or a delivery person and you’re trying to maximize your efficiency by adjusting your start and stop times for each day, along with the duration of each of your stops, throwing sticks to the wind and trying to make sense of where they land might be more productive than using DeLorme SA.  It allows for NO start or stop time, and entering a duration for each stop is enough to make you want to hurt people.  As a comparison, in MS S&T, if you want to adjust your start time or a stop’s duration, you simply double click that address in the left pane, which lies in the same window as the place where you entered it.  Up pops the time window for that stop.  If you want to do it in DeLorme  SA, here are the steps…  make sure you’re in the Route tab.  Then click the Advanced button on the bottom left.  Then locate (scroll if necessary) the stop you’d like to adjust and click on it in the center pane.  Then click the Stop Pref’s button on the right side.  NOW you can enter a duration for your stop.  It makes me imagine a microwave where the some of the number buttons are on the left of the microwave, some are in the middle below the door, and the rest of the buttons are on the right side, and they seem to have forgotten to put a ""start"" button on the thing. And for good measure, let’s remove all the quick setting buttons from the microwave.  You know, the quick minute button and all those – they’re way too useful.My bottom line for this software is you’re probably only looking at it for one of a few reasons, and it just doesn’t do a good job at ANY of them.  You’re options for a Streets and Trips replacement are thin for sure, and I’m still looking.  If that’s what you’re in search of, good luck, SA is NOT IT.  If you need a simple GPS/mapping program, this is NOT IT.  Simple isn’t apparently in this software team’s vocabulary.  And if you’re looking for a routing program of any kind, with any level of efficiency to it at all, this is also NOT IT.This is, hands down, the single worst-written piece of software I’ve laid my eyes on since the Windows 3.x days.  I wish 0 stars was an option.  No joke.",1,1

R13LGSU6FP5A42,"Before you read the one ""Perfect"" review, please read mine. I was very happy to find this scale to work with my Endicia Account and my Dymo LabelWriter 4XL. Upon arrival I shipped my first package. When we took the package to the U.S. Post Office, they weighed the package and declared that it was 5.6 more ounces and would cost more money to ship. This defeated the purpose of purchasing and printing postage.  So I called Dymo and their customer service was very nice and after over an hour on the phone they told me that the scale must be defective and will be replaced. So I received a new one today, and the new scale is exactly the same. I was told by Dymo to use weights from a gym as a constant to weigh on the scale. When I put 40 lbs on the old scale and the new scale and they both displayed 39 lbs. This is totally unacceptable to be 1lb off from the actual weight. So when I use this scale it will always print the wrong postage.  The manual says the fluctuation is +-.4lb but it is more in some cases.  Dymo should really produce a more accurate scale, especially if you are using it connected to a computer through USB and using the Endicia software.  For our company, this scale is totally unusable. I am quite surprised that Dymo would put out a product that does not display the proper weight. Save yourself the trouble and get another scale.",0,0

Just not really worth it for the ability to hold only 6 cards.  I could see if they gave you two in the pack, but obviously something has changed since others have purchased.  I ordered two packs and each pack had ONE sheet in it.  I'd look elsewhere if you need some of these.  Made in China.  Nothing special.EDIT:  Are you kidding me???  Go to put the cards in and the edge of the card hits the hole punch area for the rings!  I've tried to capture a picture of this for you.  Card is in straight and all the cards I have do the same thing.  It is like the jig is off when they make them or they are heat sealing them together differently.

R2LH8Q649OHFDY,"This was my first time purchasing pop protectors and I chose ecotek based on the good reviews, so I had no issues getting the 50 pack for the extra value. Unfortunately I don’t know if this is a common occurrence but the first wrapped set of twenty protectors I opened from the box, more than 15 of them are not useable because two parts of the base of the protectors were essentially melted together and when you try to pull it to lock as their YouTube video instructs, the bottom flaps just rip where the two parts had melted together. Haven’t checked the rest of the box yet, but receiving 15+ Unusable protectors due to a defect is enough for me to rate it. Very disappointed, I was excited for these and let down.Edit:I was able to save most of the bad protectors separating the melted plastic on the bottom, still 6 were bad. Great protectors if I didn’t get any defective, unfortunate",0,0

R17V9KS6J0RSB1,"This performance planner and the company behind it have some strengths as in journalling goals, strategies, progress, beliefs etc is always a good idea ... so what's the downside?a) The Planner itself only lasts 2 months, so if use daily, as you should in a year, 6 copies would be needed costing a small fortune for what is basically the same sheet repeated 365 times.b) It is totally based around High Performance thinking, so unless you have read, liked and want to use that method the content is of dubious value.c) The format of the journal is HUGE like an ancient desk diary (I'm ancient, I know!) so useless for those who move around. Very impractical.d) I foolishly bought the planner thinking it would be good for anyone setting goals, but as I say it isn't unless you like High Performance book/thinkinge) I've read the first chapter of this book after ordering the planner (my mistake) and realised from that and then signing up for more info or checking out the blog than the author and his team are so hardcore sales directed (yes, they are High Performance) they are exhausting to read or listen or correspond with unless you already believe in this aggressive ""How Great I Am"" approach of the author and his team.f) I believe I either bought or got a free copy of an earlier Brendon Burchard book and had forgotten I had ... probably as I repressed it as being against my values (I'm more human based and less sell, sell, sell orientated) so i found it rather distastefulg) I am reading James Clear ""Atomic Habits"" which I like a lot and recommend but for some reason, someone with his agreement has made a planner too, but it is quite expensive for what in both his and High Performance should really be included s a worksheet in their books that can be downloaded and printed out as a PDF and then photocopied or simply copy the page from the book, or write down in a $2 notebook the key elements.h) It feels like having eaten the meat, the planners offer you the same bones, over and over again at several times the price of the meat. I'm lazy, yes! So I like some of the work to have been done instead of having to create my own journal but am dubious, at least in this case, that its worth it.I gave this Planner 2 stars instead of 1 for two reasons, its production is of very high quality (well done!) and clearly a lot of people like High Performance and don't find it as annoying as me (suspect it could partly be a cultural thing, not being from the USA).",0,0

However, this stapler has caused so many headaches that I have no choice but to share my experience to save other of the misery.First, I'll start off by acknowledging how well the stapler is built. It feels well constructed and quite sturdy. The ability to quickly reveal the slide out staple holder is great. Unfortunately, that's where the benefits end.When it comes to functionality, this stapler could not be worse. From the moment I took it out of the box and made my first staple, it has been getting jammed. Without exaggeration, every one in two staples results in a jam. Even easy paper loads of just 5-15 sheets would result in a jam. In fact, it reached a point where I would often print two copies of a document so that I could easily throw the first one out if the stapler jammed and the resulting destruction to the corner of my document made it unusable.I've tried to get by with the stapler's very limited functionality by using it only when needed for larger stacks of paper.

In 2020, to have a brand new, perfectly good stapler fail so often and so badly for no apparent reason is just unacceptable. This stapler is entirely unfit for any professional work.",0,0

R3E05PVO5M23OG,"When I bought this product I was happy, they worked fine, but then I updated the firmware on my printer and they are no longer recognized. So it's really a gamble, I would have given them a 5 star rating before I updated my firmware, but now it appears Epson found a way to stop people from using ink that wasn't bought directly from them.

The tolerances and fitment of the wheels weren't the greatest, with the larger rear wheels wobbling ever so slightly. This would probably be a non-issue on smoother surfaces, but in Queens? I made it a half dozen blocks on my way home from Costco before one of the hub on one of the rear wheels cracked, toppled the cart, caused a glass bottle to shatter, and tripped me up enough to fall over with the cart and slice a finger open on said glass.Suffice to say this is on its way back, and I'll be looking for something with bearings and solid rubber wheels.",0,0

REVQZDGLV67TH,"This chart is very confusing.  There are a lot of questions about using it for multiple children, and the responses given seem very misleading.  I'm actually using it for just one child, but I don't really see how it would work for more than one child.There are spaces for chores on the left of the chart.  Then there's a column for each day of the week across the top.  There's one extra column at the far right.At the bottom it shows a little space to record ""Names"" as though it's for multiple children.  There are 4 different colored stars depicted next to the lines, which sort of makes me feel like there should be a star for each child.  There isn't.  There are only two star magnets, and they are as depicted.  They're a little bit larger than the spaces.  I just don't understand what they are for.  You wouldn't use them to check off chores completed - there are only two of them.  Maybe to indicate which chore each child should complete?  But then there should be four magnets to match the four names.  Two star magnets that are a bit bigger than the spaces...?  We ended up using the star magnets on the fridge.And finally - the dry erase marker.  The quality of the actual marker is good, but the star stamp side doesn't work.  It's hard, not like a sponge.  It would work on paper, but on another hard surface, it's impossible to make a star stamp.  Very disappointing as I thought - Oh well if I don't get what the star magnets are for.  I have this nifty stamp!  - Not so much.The actual quality of the board is good.  It's sturdy, graphics are nice, pen is of good quality.  I didn't use the magnets included to mount the board.

R3UGZR5WT0XWSK,"I am a teacher, and these were purchased for me by generous benefactors, which is why I will not have the ""Confirmed Purchaser"" tag at the top of this review.I teach special education students, and they have difficulty using rulers, let alone geometric compasses. The cheap plastic ones the school provides are frustrating to use, so I was looking for another option.I was happy with Mr. Pen's little geometry packet, the $9.99 one that comes with compasses and rulers and such, and so I was happy to take a gamble on these reasonably-priced compasses.The idea was that these compasses LOCK, which makes it easier to draw circles. My students were having difficulties with the compasses falling open as they drew. These were going to be the answer to my problems and I was going to buy many more once I was able; I was expecting to furnish an entire classroom set.10 seconds into our first activity with them.

Over and over again the points and lead would simply slide up into the compass, making them useless to anyone, let alone students who struggle with motor skills.

R3EEBORRTO4RTD,"If you’re after the short, down and dirty version, here it is…This program is a complete waste of time and energy.Now, for the actual review.If you’re after a simple GPS or mapping program, others are freely available.  And this program is about as far from “simple” as any software I’ve ever written, reviewed, tested, or even seen.  It’s “EZ Nav Route Wizard” is their sad attempt at providing a simpler interface by bypassing most of their ""features"", but it’s power is nil.  If you want simple directions from one place to another, that’s their way of giving it to you.  However, I’m baffled by why, if that’s what you’re after, you’re even considering this.  What DeLorme should have done, instead of wasting time developing a goofy simplistic option like this and sticking it in their ridiculously bulky and inefficient program is spend some time and effort simplifying the entire thing.  Imagine the control panel/dashboard of a 777 jetliner, with a seemingly infinite array of stuff, and a button in the middle that says “Fly to Chicago”.  Yeah, nice idea DeLorme.  Why not just make the thing easier to fly?  See, the bottom line is none of us is trying to fly a jetliner, we’re just trying to drive to a few places as quickly, easily and efficiently as possible, and we don’t need the dash of a 777 to do it.If, like many people who were abandoned by Microsoft when they stopped producing Streets & Trips even though it was consistently rated #1, you’re looking for a program that serves as a GPS and a routing program, DELORME STREET ATLAS IS NOT IT.  This program has extremely limited power in this regard – so much so that there’s no way to include it in that category.  If you, for instance, have a round trip to plan, where you know your start and end points, and have multiple stops to make but aren’t sure what order to put them in, or lets say you’re a service technician or salesman or a delivery person and you’re trying to maximize your efficiency by adjusting your start and stop times for each day, along with the duration of each of your stops, throwing sticks to the wind and trying to make sense of where they land might be more productive than using DeLorme SA.  It allows for NO start or stop time, and entering a duration for each stop is enough to make you want to hurt people.  As a comparison, in MS S&T, if you want to adjust your start time or a stop’s duration, you simply double click that address in the left pane, which lies in the same window as the place where you entered it.  Up pops the time window for that stop.  If you want to do it in DeLorme  SA, here are the steps…  make sure you’re in the Route tab.  Then click the Advanced button on the bottom left.  Then locate (scroll if necessary) the stop you’d like to adjust and click on it in the center pane.  Then click the Stop Pref’s button on the right side.  NOW you can enter a duration for your stop.  It makes me imagine a microwave where the some of the number buttons are on the left of the microwave, some are in the middle below the door, and the rest of the buttons are on the right side, and they seem to have forgotten to put a ""start"" button on the thing. And for good measure, let’s remove all the quick setting buttons from the microwave.  You know, the quick minute button and all those – they’re way too useful.My bottom line for this software is you’re probably only looking at it for one of a few reasons, and it just doesn’t do a good job at ANY of them.  You’re options for a Streets and Trips replacement are thin for sure, and I’m still looking.  If that’s what you’re in search of, good luck, SA is NOT IT.  If you need a simple GPS/mapping program, this is NOT IT.  Simple isn’t apparently in this software team’s vocabulary.  And if you’re looking for a routing program of any kind, with any level of efficiency to it at all, this is also NOT IT.This is, hands down, the single worst-written piece of software I’ve laid my eyes on since the Windows 3.x days.  I wish 0 stars was an option.  No joke.",1,1

Hence, the 1 star. A week after using two of these to replace the Canon cartridges, we got an error code that indicated the printer head was in trouble. So we watched some YouTube videos and proceeded to remove, clean and dry the print head. We noticed in these repair videos that the faulty cartridges were all off-brand (clear ends vs Canon's black ends)..The two replacement cartridges had dumped ink inside the printer. After getting the same error code again, we repeated the process, with the same result. We called a printer repair store, and they told us that 70% of their printer repairs are because of off-brand ink cartridges, and that generally, the repair costs as much as a new printer these days. Sometimes, it costs a lot to save a little. So, buyer beware! There's a really good chance that using these cartridges to save a few bucks will cost you your printer!",0,0

R1COC2HDUYUL9F,"I was disappointed with this purchase because the ink leaked, the feather was misshapen, and the nibs required manipulation with a pliers to fit.Other reviewers mentioned the nibs, so I was prepared for that.  However, the ink was a surprise. When I first took the jar out of its packaging and it left ink on my fingers, I removed the cap, cleaned the jar, threads and lid, and replaced tightly, making sure to keep the package as upright as possible. However, by Christmas morning when my daughter opened it, the ink had again leaked, leaving a mess. My product suggestion here is to use a better quality container, but with ink I would think that should be fairly obvious. For the feather, it was in a plastic sleeve but still a bit mangled.While the idea is good and the components of a real feather-pen writing experience were all there, all in all, this was a disappointing product.",0,0

I replaced my OEM, to find this new refurb'd toner cartridge left vertical lines in the paper.

I also had to remove and replace the chip on the assembly (super easy to do) so the cartridge showed the printer the right color and level of toner.No more vertical lines!!!This video helped me understand the components of the cartridge;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jn6DpDC8g8UThis was the video that helped me remove and replace the proper components (even though not in English, pretty obvious);https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b993mOHvQu0I hope this review helps others correct their issue with this sellers toner cartridges, as it did me!!!",0,0

But I really wish I bought a different product.I bought this to add some extra storage for a new vanity set up. I knew it was on the smaller side than a more faithful Ikea Alex dupe, plus it was a true black finish, so I thought it would be a good fit for my needs since I didn’t plan on putting in anything really big. Plus, it was made of solid wood for the frame instead of chipboard throughout, so it had to be sturdy, right?I wish I paid more attention to the reviews.The wood is not well treated. It splintered in many spots and lacks predrilled holes where I feel they are needed to prevent splintering or screws being put in at bad angles. Some pieces arrived split and splintered in spots. This caused me to forego some screws, though luckily no where I think it is really needed for structural support. But this issue could happen easily somewhere that it is needed.I hade a hard time getting the casters in and needed to find a piece of wood that would fit above the wheels to hammer in the last one without breaking it. Major design flaw.The casters are just plastic bars, and they cause a lot of friction with pulling the drawers in and out. Some drawers take a little more effort to pull open than others. They’re also white and because the drawer faces aren’t designed to perfectly fill the frame, you can see them which is not particularly attractive. Mine might look worse because of the lack of predrilled holes to help keep the drawers uniform when you assemble them. It looks as cheap as it is, which is sad because I’ve paid the same price at Target for shelves that look great.At the end of the day, flat pack furniture that isn’t wall mounted should ideally only require a screwdriver and a mallet to assemble properly. Affordable flat pack furniture should for people that don’t have access to power tools. This required a power drill, an extra wood bit, and would have benefited from me using my leveler. If I knew, I would have just bought an Alex from Ikea and painted it black.",0,0

It adjusts fairly well.  Some things that do irritate me is it can become top heavy if you don't have the legs adjusted correctly, but after about 3 months it's really stood up and become a necessity at the moment for me.  I change the orientation regularly (3-4 times a week) and it hasn't gotten loose or broken yet. For the price you really can't go wrong if you need an adjustable table top for a chair.The only other complaint is I'd like the desk to have at least a lip on either side so that my mouse doesn't slip off whenever I move..  I've had to keep one of desk a little shorter than I'd like by keeping the first link parallel to the desk fort that reason, this is the primary reason for 4 stars.Update:  My first one broke a link but I blamed it on me accidentally knocking it off a table , and since it had worked well for what it was, I got another.

Ever thought about instigating madness in the mind of your preferred packaging specialist?If so, this is the perfect product for you!To call this “tape” is so far below it’s true purpose. This is not tape. This... is a mildly sticky, highly fragile, variable thickness, transparent, colored polymer on a roll.Strong? No.Easy to use? No.Capable as an unsolvable puzzle? Yeah, maybe.It all starts when your victim attempts to find the start of the roll... its so thin and imperceptible at an edge, that they will swear there is no edge at all. I literally used a razor blade to try and locate the end... sliding around and around in either direction to no avail. Eventually I used a quality packing tape, to tape over where a I thought an edge may be and pulled up the new roll’s edge. Beautiful insanity!This is where it really gets good... your victim now things they have a start. Home free... Not so fast track star! As soon as they begin to pull the piece they need... Pop, rip, tear, desentigrate! Spectacular!With their spirit crushed, they set their mind to understanding the complexities of defeat. Tweezers, knives, watercolor paintbrushes and even lavender oil are brought to solve the mystery. The only clue to this evil’s diabolical nature however is the first usable size piece to come from the roll shows a preposterous hole in the middle with the oddly teardrop shaped hole.This is where it ends. The marbles are lost. The cheese is slid completely off the cracker. All that is left is to decide where they will begin to dig their grave.Oh, in case you’re wondering if its just a one roll fluke...

R8IP14SMJSRU2,"After reading the reviews I ordered two, hoping that one of them would work. As expected, actually one of them worked, the other one was completely dead. Unfortunately there are virtually no alternatives for 9mm pencils that work with batteries. (If you know of any, please comment).The good thing with this sharpener is that the blade and the motor are basically fine and the construction is so simple that most issues are easy to spot and fix: If you unscrew the screw in the battery compartment you can take off the top part to look inside. It needs a bit of force because there are two latches in the front. Take care not to lose the little black plastic switch next to the sharpener hole. Don't bother trying to take off the bottom part. You don't need to.In my case, one of the contacts in the battery compartment was not soldered properly, so I fixed the solder joint and it worked. Also, the security mechanism that keeps the blade from moving when the front cover is not attached, is extremely flimsy. If you have no children or other people in your household who may try to touch the rotating blade, I recommend getting rid of that mechanism and simply soldering the two metal pieces near the front of the device together. If you do not solder, duct tape will work just fine. While you are at it, check if the two metal pieces next to the sharpener hole touch properly when you insert a pencil. If not, adjust and secure with duct tape. ^^Now you can put it back together. Make sure that the little black plastic switch is in place before you close the top. I haven't run into any more problems for a coup;e of months since fixing it so I hope it will work for you, too.",0,0
RLZYA8OO20JZP,"Sharpie tends to make good items and I have used their permanent markers for years, no complaints.  I've even used their fine tip paint marker and they worked great.  However, this Sharpie Paint Marker Extra-fine was a disaster.  After shaking and depressing the tip a few times to saturate the stylus, nothing, zippo.  Kept shaking, then tried several more times, and the tip came loose.  Stuck the tip back in (because I love a challenge).  What a piece of cr*p, and I'm being objective in this review.  Now, I read some positive comments that suggested they worked well, so there are a few good ones out there.  Is it a QA thing?  Does the tip dry up so it won't absorb paint?  Maybe it's an expiration date problem?  Whatever the issue, it was a few bucks down the drain and into the landfills.",0,0
RMTRZV0X3GIS1,"Not happy. These are NOT card stock or anything other than cheap, thin, plain paper cut to 4 x 6 size. Guess they would work fine if you don't mind ink showing through to the other side because they are so thin.TIP to SAVE $$: Use these index cards with your microscope instead of pricey glass slides!We use these in the hobby of raising monarch butterflies. Having raised 500+ butterflies this season, and using a microscope to check each for OE disease before releasing them, these index card have been very useful. Since glass slides for each one would be incredibly expensive, we opted to use a piece of clear-view scotch tape to collect the scales/spore sample by rubbing it gently onto the butterfly's abdomen, and then affixing it to these paper index cards.While the method has worked well, the cards are too thin to be able to use both sides, so it just takes more space and more cards than I think is really necessary, had these just been made of cardstock instead of plain paper.I am using them because 3 times I have ordered ""index cards"" and they are all made of cheap, thin paper and not card stock anymore (including the ones at Walmart), but I won't buy these again.

The paper is almost card-stock thick and very smooth - I've used markers (even Sharpies) on it, with repeated strokes over the same place, and erased many pencil marks, without any deterioration or show-through.However, it is so smooth that my Pilot Frixion pens just slide right off of them without writing, which is a bummer because I specifically bought this journal for bullet-journaling and writing in appointments, which often change at the last moment, so I'd like to be able to use my frixion pens, which are erasable.  The ink just balls up and doesn't write (for the XF) or takes many attempts to produce a splotchy pale line (F or M).  I've never had this problem with these pens before - they write on all normal copy papers, but this paper is quite slick/slippery in its smoothness.  If you have a good-flowing Pilot G-2 XF, they write well on this paper, and so I was willing to overlook this difficulty (no Frixion pens), but the binding broke...  I really wish this binding had held, and pages were not falling out.In addition, as another reviewer noted, the cover does not tightly fit the spine, and does puff out, noticeably, both when open and closed.  Its looseness means you can feel the bumpy binding (that then cracked), so it doesn't feel as professionally made as moleskine or rhodia or even leuchtturm1917.  I was willing to overlook this as a cosmetic issue that was worth it because of the price, but the pages falling out is a no-go.I have contacted the seller, but not yet heard back.  I will update this review after this issue has been resolved (a refund, I imagine).  If I do not update this review, then they did not get back to me.Also, they are offering free pack of pens to amazon buyers, in exchange for reviews of a positive nature that do not mention the pens, so be wary of some of these reviews.  (Guess they should have addressed my complaint a little sooner, eh?)",0,0

R15DKCCNHS2KXW,"This is the first time I've felt compelled to write a review on Amazon. I've generally had good experiences with items I've bought, thinking that the overall ratings would be correlated to a reasonable extent with the actual quality of the product. This was not the case with this toner cartridge.I wish I had paid more attention to the 500+ 1-star reviews. It's easy to disregard them when you see a relatively high overall rating, but in this case, I am sorry that I didn't heed the multitude of warnings for this product.I have a Brother HL-2270DW printer, and this was the first time I was replacing the toner cartridge for it. I followed the very poorly written instructions that came with this cartridge and had no success in convincing my printer to turn off its error light. I tried all possible resets that I could find online, and I even called Brother (which included a 30-minute hold time) to ask for support over the phone. Brother had no idea what was wrong and referred me to a local business machines store, where they were able to confirm that this toner cartridge was the problem. The toner simply doesn't work.My advice -- DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. I am very disappointed that Amazon still offers this item given how many awful reviews exist. Then again, I'm very disappointed in my own naive hope that a significantly-cheaper-than-brand-name product from this manufacturer would be a sufficient replacement. No free lunch, I guess. :)",0,0

R2INITHCITUCVB,"The old bait and switch.I ordered what I thought was going to be the Ultra Pro ""Special Combo Deal"" of the sleeves and the top loads and instead they shipped me an inferior brand. Maybe the vendor or customers think its the same, but nevertheless it's not what I ordered. I can only assume it's a cheaper product and Wowzzer makes more money when they sub out the actual product for a cheaper one. I guess it's always a gamble when you order online. Makes you think - how can there be so many positive reviews for a product? Answer skews to the shining 5 star reviews must be written by the vendors cousin, brother or nephew.Here's a little about me as a hobbyist: I'm a sports card and memorabilia collector and have been collecting since 1984. I have a special collection of valuable rookie cards and only trust placing them in the right plastic sleeves and hard holders. I've used Ultra Pro in the past and that's why I ordered them. But as mentioned, the vendor shipped another brand (BCW) instead.The sides of the BCW top loaders have awkward oil and glue markings. Overall, they are thinner than Ultra Pro. BCW holders also have more give (an undesirable characteristic). They are softer and more flexible then the Ultra Pro ones pictured. This means they are not the best product to protect your cards.  Don't get me wrong, they are not horrible. I just don't like them as much as the ones I thought I was buying, which were a better product.I guess the one thing I can't complain about is the price. They are very cheap and offer decent value, hence the 2 stars. Just be fair warned, you may not get the brand you want and if you read the small print they point out that the ol' ""switcheroo"" is likely a comin.I would not use these for my more valuable cards but perhaps those I might sell to someone else in a short amount of time.

R18Z20D37ZK6VE,"I used this scale for years without any problem. Up until 2011. The hallmark feature of this scale is supposed to be its ability to download UPS, FedEX and USPS rates from the internet.

R11HZ5JG5G411I,"The first time I bought one of these carts was about 2 years.  I used it to go grocery shopping, about a 4-mile round-trip for me, up and down a lot of hills. I buy a lot of food at one time because the trip is exhausting and this cart generally carried it all very well.  It folded nicely and was easy to store.  It was great!About 1 year after owning it, one of the wheels fell off on a shopping trip.  I managed to save it and get the cart home again.  I repaired the wheel with a simple screw and it worked fine for another year.About 2 months ago on a grocery trip, another wheel fell off.  This time I could *not* find the lost wheel, so I could not repair the cart again.  I ordered a new one, thinking it would be as great as the old one had been.I WAS WRONG.What I got was a piece of JUNK (I'd used stronger words, but I want this review to be posted.)  The types of wheels had been changed.  Instead of the former rubber ones, these were now plastic.  The problem was these new wheels were TOO BIG for the cart itself!  The cart would no longer fold properly, because it had NOT been redesigned for these larger wheels.  The new wheels also interfered with the ability for the card to move properly!I went on my first grocery shopping trip with the new cart.  Getting the cart there and back was an ongoing problem during the trip because the wheels kept hitting the metal of the cart.I returned home with my food and when I got there, one of the metal supports for a wheel *BROKEN*, nearly collapsing the cart and spilling all my groceries.The cart was RUINED.  It was UNREPAIRABLE.  After using it ONCE!  I threw it out in the trash the next day.  I couldn't stand to see it and think of the money I had wasted.I am on a very-fixed income; the lost of the $20 for this piece of junk cart is money I could not afford to waste.  But this cart is now long gone, taken away in the trash where it belonged in the first place.  It should NEVER have been sold because of the replaceable of the old type of wheels with cheaper ones which did NOT FIT.  Either wheels of the same size as had been previously used for it should have been added - or the metal cart itself should have been redone to properly fit these larger wheels.Now I have to find and buy and pay for another large cart to carry my groceries; I have to find a way to afford it.  You can be certain I will *NOT BUY* a 3rd one of these carts!** UPDATE! **I also posted negative feedback to this seller's account.  A short time after that I got a email from him offering me a full-refund if I would change my negative feedback to positive.I said ""No"".The fact is, this seller is likely going to *keep* selling these shopping cards that are defective as can be seen in the *recent*, very negative reviews here.  He is also likely going to keep selling a lot more of these carts in different colors in other Amazon listings.I'm out my money, which as I said, I truly cannot afford to waste.  However, I am not going to change ANYTHING that might warn people here these carts are seriously defected because changes that were made to the wheels -- and DO NOT BUY ONE!  I can't afford to have waste money of this piece of junk, but I would rather loose that money in the hope that someone else might NOT buy one of these carts because of my review.* * * * * * * * * * *AGAIN, DO NOT BUY THIS CART!

My previous review mentioned this.  Shortly thereafter, I tossed the first cartridge in hopes that the second would be better....but I was wrong.

R3IYIQ0ALTWOKF,"This toner doesn't print. It constantly flashes Error light. The first print with paper jam (Error light flashed). After reset cartridge  multiple times (turn off, open front door, clicking Go button twice, wait for 3 lights on (whether wait 30s or not) ,  then click on Go button 7 times ... etc per online tip), then it finally allowed me to print again. But instantly, the paper jammed. It doesn't matter I use duplex or not, paper jams. The ""Error"" light does not go off even I tried to reset cartridge multiple times. Then I switch to old toner, the problem went away.) Strangely, I bought the same kind of toner (from different seller) 1 year ago which worked. The quality is unstable. The problem is I didn't test this one when it was delivered couple months ago ( since it was working before); now when I really needed it, I could not return it even it doesn't work. So if you do plan to buy this toner, make sure to test it right away to see if it work not. After reviewed my previous orders from different sellers I am not sure if they are the same OEM product. However, Amazon seems always link to this Cool Toner Compatible link now, even though my previous purchase link name doesn't have ""Cool Toner"".",0,0

R1L9FI1C45ZAB7,"Like many other reviews have said, this thing is a flimsy piece of crap. I bought it with the intention of using it for a specific project and didn't want to break the bank on a more expensive compass, so I settled for this. The moment I tried to use it, the issues started piling up. Every time you try to draw with this, several different things are going to happen. One, the needle at the center of the circle will move out of place. Two, the line it produces, if it produces one at all, will be broken and deformed as you struggle to twist it while keeping the center in place. Three, the arm will bend all over the place once you finally get the pressure and directionality perfect. Four, the arms will move further apart as you go, forcing you to readjust after every single circle you manage to make. Anything you manage to draw out of this will be an extremely thick broken line in the general shape of a circle, likely one without a consistent radius.

R11EZ9EP2X4VUP,I do not recommend this. I got it at work and it is the most uncomfortable pad i have ever gotten. the padding is stiff compared to gel based ones. The pads on the bottom do not stick but are a hardened rubber that slides around on the desk. If you are not at the perfect height which is based on your desk to wrist ratio  you will end up with a kink in your wrist. This aggravates my Carpel Tunnel worse than any pad I have used. The one I have at home for gaming and long computer use is much better. It is the deadpool mouse pad with a gel chest where my wrist rests gently in the crease of his pecks. If there was a 0 star rating I would be using that for the above purchase.,1,1

So, I can't fault anyone who is reading this and thinking to themselves ""you get what you pay for"" but I would have been fine getting something worth what I paid or even a little less, because I'm pretty sure that's how commerce works on a good day.

The description doesnt mention the size, it takes up half my desk when it’s open, so it sits closed on the floor and I keep my to-do page on the desk. The weekly assessment pages ask questions about the day. So it’s confusing and I haven’t used it. I have gone back to using the planner pages I have designed myself in my own planner.

R2YUAWMV2P1BYN,"This company talks about how great this drawer unit is because its made of real wood, not particle board. Okay, yes, its real wood. I give them that. But get ready - its a real hassle to build it (unless you have a DRILL which we don't). It took us two hours, using a Philips head screwdriver and by the time I was finished, my hands and arms were really sore! The worst of it is, the bottoms of the drawers have no lock pins, nor does the manufacturer provide ""brads"" or even small nails to secure the drawer bottoms at the back, so they simply are free to slide out of the little ""grooves"" provided for them. See the pic attached. As a temporary fix, I put a piece of gaffers tape across the bottom to keep the drawer bottom from sliding out. Next step - going to Home Depot to get some small industrial staples or small nails so I can ""jerry-rig"" this thing, and take the gaffers tape off. All in all, this one issue is INFURIATING: it simply means this a STUPID/INEPT DESIGN, and extremely CARELESS ENGINEERING by the manufacturer. If they included little staples or extra nails to hammer in to hold the drawer bottoms in place, I would have given this a 4 star review. I hope the manufacturer actually reads this, as its a situation that could be easily remedied.",0,0
R2V92GVWA2ISRN,"When buying a replacement cartridge there is only really one thing that matters: whether it works or not.  This one does not.  I see many people have reported success with this cartridge, but the one I got was a mess, and I'm lucky it didn't ruin my printer.  It leaked toner all over the inside of the printer, printed large 1"" thick black lines down each page, and was just a total failure.  It was installed into a once-used official Brother toner carrier.  If you judge by the star ratings, this has 4 stars.  That means a lot of people are lucky enough to get a good one.  So if you buy this product, what is the chance yours will be a failure?  Making some simplifying assumptions, that 1-star reviews are failures, and 5-star reviews are good, there is a 25% chance yours will be a dud.  Maybe look somewhere else.",0,0
R158Q2AZ90LF8M,"This is my first review of anything.  I have been buying more on Amazon because I have a Prime membership and it is so easy to order.  I may have gotten a little carried away buying a package of 12 pens I would not spend the money on trying to return.These pens are useless to me since my first pen is blotting after hardly any use.  I prefer a fine point, am not fussy about blue or black, but a pen that blots is useless to me.  I do not want to sign a letter or card only to have my pen blot.  I do a fair amount of note taking and underlining in books and I do not want my pen to leave blots of ink.There did not seem to be an option to give no stars, but since I do not plan to use any of the box of 12 pens I just bought, I cannot imagine why I would give them any stars at all.Do not buy these pens.

Rated at 85,000 images a month, I managed only 13,466 images before the print head started leaking and because a refurbished replacement costs 70% of a new unit and the ink is another 80% it truly is disposable once the ink runs out.

Was hoping it would function like other customers had stated, but it streaked immedieatly from the outset.  This is such a POOR product that is not worth spending your time or money to buy.  Spend your $15 on somewhere else.  Evidently, you are buying a ""re-furbished"" cartridge that only has new toner in it and cannot be expected to function well enough to print normally.  Considering it functioned so poorly, I would recommend buying a refurbished cartridge for about $37 from LDProducts -- like I have from the past.  At least LDP guarantees that your replacement cartridge will function properly or you get a replacement.  I made the mistake of thinking I could buy one for half the price, but got STUNG.

RMOUWZBOM7ALV,"I was really upset when I received my item in a beat-up box where the paper cutter handle was exposed and was just hanging by a thread with the tape around it. It was not very pleasing to the eyes. I bought this cutter because of the reviews and the price. Sometimes, it's better to pay more to have fewer headaches.Some of my thoughts...1. The box that it came in was beat-up. It was the original box but come on, it was ripped everywhere.2. There was a clinging sound inside. A tiny piece broke off (probably from the shipping) when I was trying to take off the tape to open the box.3. The locking mechanism was broken. When I finally got all of the tapes around the box, that handle with a freaking sharp edge just popped open on my face. That was a little something. There's no way for me to lock it in place either.  So it just stayed lifted. Not safe at all.4. The handle is already chipped and the adjustable backstop was fractured (plastic material).5. The paper cutter was sharp and lightweight but I guess you will have to put some weight when you try to cut papers and make sure it's on a flat open space area for safety.6. It was a perfect size for home-use. It wasn't too big or small to just do normal document or paper cuttings.I contacted Amazon to return my item and finally, on the 3rd day the company reached out to me. I appreciated their response and they seemed genuine about their feedback. Just sad I can't use the cutter and will have to find something else.",0,0
R2KB74VSWKW1I3,"Out of every single purchase I have ever made on Amazon, I have never had a single bad experience except with this product. It doesn't even come close to working as it should. I started by testing it out with 50 clean pennies I COUNTED ahead of time. The coins were not properly sorted, the pennies went into the nickel slot AND penny slot, the machine jammed (from only 50 pennies...come on). The wrapper also filled up before the pennies were even full so that you can't even trust the count. Already I was working with a piece of garbage product, but I decided to throw in a bunch of coins and see what it did with them. It immediately jammed (again these are clean, newish coins) and wouldn't fix itself as advertised. So I then had to figure out how to remove the jam. But there is NO WAY TO TAKE APART ANY OF THE PIECES. You can't separate the overflow tray, you can't lift the lid entirely off, you cant take out the whole sorter to remove the jam. I had coins going down into the power supply area, coins jammed in places you couldn't reach, I ended up having to take the whole thing upside down and shaking it until most of the coins fell out, then I had to detach the back panel which, again, DOESN""T detach all the way and fish around for all the coins that fell back there.

Everything seemed to work ok (not great, but ok), except for the fact that it would sharpen and then immediately break the entire tip EVERY SINGLE pencil/colored pencil I tried to sharpen. At first I thought the initial pencil I tried to sharpen just had really broken up lead inside, but after trying it on multiple pencils I realized it was the doing of the sharpener. Other than that, I really disliked that it was just one of your typical hand held pencil sharpeners attached to a motor. I didn't think about it before purchasing, but after trying to use it, all of those broken pencil tips had to be removed by hand. In other words, after each attempt I had to open it up and use a toothpick to push the broken tip back out. SO annoying!!! Do yourself a favor and buy something different.",0,0

I purchased the printer that these labels go to from Amazon and went through approximately 5 or 6 rolls of this refill product, also ordered from Amazon, when suddenly, without any explanation, Amazon informed me there was a ""slight problem"" with my order--namely that I had exceeded my limit.  The computer then automatically changed my order to ""0.""  Examine this item's page closely, do you see a limit?  I assumed there must be a computer glitch, so I left my order in my shopping cart to try another day.  Not long afterwards, I received a message from Amazon that the price had dropped, as an encouragement to order, I assume.  But no, just like the last time, there was a ""slight problem"" with my order.  I would have to abide by my limit (again, what limit?) and again only order ""0"" copies of this item.  When I inquired with Amazon, both in phone calls and emails, I have learned ""so that more people can enjoy this product"" Amazon is limiting purchases.  Translation, you are welcome to buy the printer, but don't expect Amazon to sell you refills, so that ""more people can enjoy this product.""  Needless to say, I am not enjoying this product anymore.  However since Amazon appears to consider this a reasonable policy, I will try it myself.  Therefore, so that more businesses can enjoy my purchases I am going to limit my purchases from Amazon on all of its product lines. Brother QL-570 Professional Label Printer",0,0
R1P2WGP32H8BC4,The item arrived on the date promised. However the box it was in was never ment for shipping. It wasn't even taped shut. The box was open and badly torn. The item was loose inside with no type of packing material at all and looked as  though it may have fallen out of the box several times during shipment. It was scratched in several places and had a small dent  on one side. If it hadn't been for the good quality of the item I am sure it would have been in piecesI would like to say that this was NOT shipped by amazon bit by the manufacturerThe item itself is very good and works very well. However for the price I paid for the item and shipping it wasn't worth it. I feel that an item of this price should have at least been packaged and sent to look like New when it arrives. It arrived looking as though I have been carrying it in the back of a pickup truck for awhile.So I have this item a low rating because of the lousy shipping. The item itself is a very good product if you don't Mind scratches and dings when it arrives,0,0

RS3ZZKEBEQNF8,"I love the  Prismacolor Premier Illustration Markers, Brush Tip, Set of 8 Assorted Colors  (1736674)  ones by Prismacolor, but they didn't have the expanded color palette I needed. So I branched out and got these double-ended ones. I did NOT like them at all.For clarification, I am NOT an artist - this review is solely based on my use of them for Adult Coloring Books. Specifically, the  Secret Garden: An Inky Treasure Hunt and Coloring Book .BUT, I do NOT like the Double Tipped Markers. I DID like that these markers come in TONS of colors. I even went and bought some that were the single markers just to get some extra colors - like the light blue in the photo. Unfortunately, they don't write/draw/color at all like the 'brush tips;' which are awesome. These are firm and clumsy for fine detail coloring. Additionally, I didn't like the thickness of these in my hand - they're really wide.Most importantly, I was SO DISAPPOINTED to realize these big fat markers by Prismacolor BLEED. On one page, I used all brush tip markers EXCEPT for some spots of light blue. It was a lighter color than all the others, and made by the same company, so surely (I thought) it wouldn't bleed. It did - see photos. The first photos are a page colored with the standard brush tips by Prismacolor. They didn't bleed. I used ONE of the Double-Ended Brush Tips (THIS type of marker), the light blue, and it DID bleed. The owl image is the backside of that same page. So sad. I hope this review is helpful to others considering these markers for the same purpose. Now, if you're an artist or designer, you may have a completely different experience. I found these inferior to the single-ended brush tip markers by Prismacolor... (Those are shown in the last two photos)",0,0

It appeared easy enough to clip onto a carabiner that was attached to the chest location of my backpack strap.  The pen is constructed very solidly and writes just like any ballpoint pen.  You simply tug it to detach it for use.  But the one MAJOR flaw is that the pen can accidentally detach very easily at the clip.  If it does that on its own, you'll lose your $15 pen (the most I have ever paid for one pen).  I gave this a 2nd chance, in fact, and it fell down the same fate.

As the protective wrap is clear, you will probably not be able to see where the double sided tape begins and where the wrap ends, so you will just have to touch the top of the tape to make sure you have both sides of the adhesive exposed. This protective wrap is not included in the listed dimensions of the tape, the tape length starts from the point where the protective wrap ends.""I can't review any other aspects as I haven't used it yet, but the omission of this valuable info might keep you from giving up on it. . . as I nearly did.",0,0

I looked at the reviews and I noticed that a minority of reviews strongly stated how the quality has gone down hill.  They were right.  In direct comparison - The plastic in the old pens was robust and had a good feel to it.  Now the walls are so thin that I can feel them flex a bit if I squeeze.  Shine used to be deep and lustrous much like those hand rubbed finishes on cars.  Now it is flat with minimal gloss.  The metal tip used to have a shiny finish - now not so much. It has the feel of cheap promotional pens with a thin metal top. The overall finish reminds me of old Soviet Block products.  Believe me, I could go on.  Since I sprung for an unusual color - the pen cost me $10 through Amazon Prime.  I feel the pen is worth $3-5",0,0

R236B2HCCBQ70A,"Perhaps the Optima we got is defective, though I can find nothing physically wrong with it (or the packaging). Even with the Swingline 40 staples which are supposed to staple as many as 40 pages, the best we could do was 26 pages, and the points do not bend over to make a smooth underside. In other words, you can get stuck on the points of the staples.When stapling two or three sheets, it's hit or miss. Sometimes, it performs adequately. At other times, one end of the staple is crumpled.Last, even for 25 pages, it takes some effort to get the staples to go through.I've been using Swingline products for decades, and I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and say that this one is a dud. It's going back, but I will not replace it with the same model.(Why two stars? Simply, reviews with one star are usually dismissed and not read because the reviewer is seen as disgruntled and without objectivity. So, two stars just to get you to read this. We returned this, and bought the PaperPro Prodigy Stapler. Will review that one as well.)ew",0,0
R1UZHSJ8XTG2U1,"Nice design aesthetically, and the built-in handle is nice.  But it only has two heat settings, one for 3mil and one for 5mil pouches.  I set it for 5mil and waited for it to signal it was ready, then ran through several Fellowes brand 5mil pouches (1 sheet of 20lb bond in pouch).  They all came out wavy and distorted, a symptom that points to the heat being too high.I reset it to the 3mil setting and waited for it to cool down and beep its ready signal.  I again tried a 5mil pouch (at the 3mil setting).  Much better, almost acceptable but still some waves.  Tried a 3mil pouch and it came out very wavy -- I would call it rippled.  No way to reduce heat any further since the machine only has two settings.  Apparently this machine just runs hot!Other issues...  There were minor scratches on the front panel (this panel is completely protected during shipping, so it had to come out of the factory that way).  Also, every few minutes the normal ""humming"" sound would change to a loud ""buzzing"" noise for several seconds (another reviewer complained of this too, so it isn't just this one).I returned the SL95 to Amazon and purchased a GBC H212 instead.

Content is great, typical Brendon style with great thought provoking questions each day.  The 60 days does not bother me, these type of productivity/thinking planners typically are not a full year so that was not a surprise.  So a good idea, but....The layout and the size is what I cannot get past.  For size, it is a large (8.5x11) hard back book.  The layout and space is awkward to write in.  It also has your thoughtful insite for the day right there with your schedule so if you pull out your book to make a note on your schedule or see what is next it is there for everyone to see.Personally, I would rework it.  Size should be about 1/2 what it is (maybe 8.5x5) and perhaps the layout should be broken up to two sections for each day.

R1X5KL6K61FE39,"UPDATE: As another reviewer stated, on 3rd use of this compass, the mechanism holding in the center “point” fell off and we cannot reattach. Updating review to 1 star, and would give 0 stars if possible. Look elsewhere for a sturdier compass that comes with all pieces as advertised.Upon receipt it appears we (possibly) received a used item as there were markings on the interior packaging, and there was no extra lead as indicated on the item description. The compass is very lightweight, and tends to “slip” frequently during use. I intentionally chose this compass as it was packaged separately (rather than a set), and quality appeared to be better than the type with mini-pencils inserted in product images. Overall, I would give this product a solid mid-range review. It’s unfortunate that it is not heavier, and that we did not receive the extra lead. Amazon customer service did make this right for us, thank you.",1,1

When I print shipping labels for my business, I selected B&W and blue still managed to smear across the barcodes on the label.When I printed technical documentation, there was a blue and magenta ghosting effect next to every sentence.I have very little patience to handle this poor quality situation. My expectation for a product is for it to work right out of the packaging. I do not have time or patience to call the manufacturer to get replacements.

This is amplified if you have a 17"" laptop, because on my 17"" at least 3-4"" of it is hanging over the back of the ""desK"". Now add to this the fact that this is exactly where your weight is, due to the screen connecting and sitting upright exactly over the area with no support. My laptop had fallen off the back of this thing with the littlest amount of movement, especially if I have the screen angled back at all, then it's just waiting to do a back flip off this thing.

RHWCG2JRYU153,"After installing the new toner, the printer would almost print one sheet, but then report a ""jam inside."" The jam was not inside though - the paper had gone through the fuser but wasn't delivered to the output tray. I see this problem was reported by several other users. Additionally the printer would tell me there was a jam inside even after removing the paper, but re-seating the drum unit a few times cleared the fault - until the next sheet :-(After pulling out much of my remaining hair, I came up with a temporary workaround. By running the printer with the cover open (a matchstick can be used to defeat the front cover interlock) I determined that lifting the rear of the drum unit solved the intermittent ""Jam Inside"" problem.Poking a matchstick under each side of the drum unit to raise it up allowed printing to continue. I'll look for a more permanent solution and will edit my review when I find one.In the meantime I'm back in business, though this cost me an hour, so I'm not very happy!I hope the workaround may be useful to others who haven't yet returned their cartridges.Update 24 hours later - the matchstick trick worked well. To make it a little more permanent, I flipped over the drum unit/toner carrier, and taped half a matchstick to the rear outside corners on the underside. It is enough to lift the drum unit slightly when inserted, and solves the problem. (The toner still only gets 2 stars!)",0,0

It made printing large docs very time consuming and the paper wouldn't sit flat or stack cleanly at all.  So I did a test.  I printed a 400 page document with the GP paper. I use a brother mfc 8460.  Every six or seven sheets I either had to pull the sheet or push it down.  I had to continuously monitor the production to avoid a jam.  Then I put in Hammermill Copy paper to print a second copy of the same document.  The Hammermill worked perfectly.  So perfectly, that I could write this review while it was priting.  No problem.  The Hammermill paper came out flat and stacked neatly.  This GP paper is garbage compared to Hammermill and I will never, ever purchase GP copy paper again.

PUT. so if you are totally cool with moving this thing EVERY.SINGLE.TIME. you roll in your chair and enjoy the smell of stinky plastic this will be a great buy! go for it. But if you are looking for something practical that isn't annoying beyond belief, look elsewhere!

RM5HCEL8UE6M7,I have been wanting these watercolor pens forever and because of a great deal on Amazon I was able to purchase them. I watched a lot of videos on using these water color pens and they were fabulous in those videos unfortunately my experience was not what I expected and it left me a bit sad and disappointed. In the YouTube videos I watched the watercolor pens were fluid with very juicy colors making it easy to paint and or blend colors BUT when I started using the watercolor pens I found many were a dry to very dry and did not give me color unless I pushed hard or scrubbed the brush on the paper having to do several layers to get good coloring.  I wanted to love these as the Arteza advertising of them was inspiring I think the people making the YouTube videos must have recieved better quality pens to make their videos. I may give them another try and hopefully come back with a better rating. I really wanted to love these!,0,0

I gave some thought to whether I was being too critical of it---I checked the price again to see what I paid and decided no, I'm not being too critical, for that price, it should be a little bit more tough and capable.  I've owned a lot of wheely carts and this one is the most frustrating one I've had.  I think the problem might have to do with the little flexible front wheels, but I'm not sure.",0,0

I was able to find these cheaper elsewhere as well.As a pen, they were barely functional and I returned them since I bought them as favors and don't think guests would want or use them after leaving. They wrote okay, but had a cheaper needlepoint type tip I didn't really like and I'd expect the ink runs out quickly. They feel light and cheap as well. I had a difficult time taking the caps off, but once removed they either still went on super tight or basically fell off.

I use it to close bags of potatoes (which means it is only going through about five sheets of paper) but after two years (only two boxes of staples) it broke.  Would not finish the stapling process, the final click to close the staple would not happen no matter how hard you squeezed.  I bought a replacement here at Amazon, and after opening the box, the replacement will not staple, just clogs and jams.  Even when going through one sheet of paper.  Swingline makes their staplers in China now, they definitely don't care about their product name or reputation anymore.Well, after returning the product and having a replacement sent to me from Amazon I thought I would edit my review.  The new one worked much better than the first.  The first one would not staple at all, the replacement worked for an amazing run of 5 STAPLES before it broke!  I guess improvement comes in small steps.  I returned this one, but not for a replacement, I am getting my money back...  Amazon should not disgrace themselves by offering such a horrible product on their website.  If anyone here needs four boxes of overpriced special staples that this thing takes, I have them.",0,0

After a few years my scale started not going back to zero, and flickering up to .05 ounces which I have to account for each time, and only rarely goes back to 0 if you keep on messing with it which is very time consuming. But on start it is always over 0, and with no weight or dirt on top. I emailed the company several times about getting a new one and they never replied. So the lifetime warranty is a lie beware.

The ink was all over my hands, the printer, the printer stand and the rug below.Making things even worse, the black cartridge did not fit correctly. It had to be forced into the ink head.Think I am exaggerating?

R5Y2G24864IJB,"Let me tell you about #1 Best Scale. It is heavy which was impressive. That is the reason I bought it. However, after one week of use when you turn it on you simply get a blank screen. No matter what you do, no matter what buttons you push, it remains blank. So, you have to unplug the head from the power cord and re-plug it back in and the thing works. So no, I don't want to have to power my unit up twice each time I wish to use it.  The only reason I did not give it one start instead of two is that it is heavy and appears to be a solid scale once you get power to it.

R36HAS8LV5Y9L5,"The 8570 prints gorgeous pictures, but when it breaks, it breaks permanently. We have gone through five 8570’s over the past 4 years, with each of them experiencing what I would consider low to moderate print volume. Before these 8570’s we went through several 8550’s which are basically the same printer, all with the same type of unrepairable mechanical failures. These solid ink printers are a reliability nightmare with their only saving grace being that fantastic print quality.I’m finally writing this review because I just had to decommission yet another broken 8570 (this one was 3 years and 2 months old), and I replaced it instead with a HP Color Laserjet that is more reliable and with cheaper supplies - even though the prints don’t look as good as the 8570.Most of our 8570’s end up dying after 3 years with a Print Head failure. We tried to repair them the first couple of times that they died, just to find out the cost of the repair exceeds the cost of a new printer by a few hundred dollars. So we bought new printers and trashed the old ones as they died off.Why keep buying printers that break so often? The artists love the print quality, and the ink is useless to any other device and an investment in it’s own right. Colors are vibrant, lines are sharp, they’re fairly easy to network, and they work fine on Macs and PCs. They weigh a ton but they’re not very loud. Even though it costs about $250 to get a full ink supply – yes, close to half the price of the printer - the ink does seem to last a while although it has a tendency to melt itself needlessly (as part of it’s cleaning process) if you don’t use the printer for extended periods of time.That’s the main reason we’ve kept replacing them with new 8570’s. It’s so wasteful but you’re stuck with the supplies and the clients love the prints.Ink is ridiculously expensive and difficult to find, so if you run out you can’t stop by your neighborhood Office Max to grab more. You basically always have to mail order ink. Generally, the 8570’s day to day reliability is fine. It doesn’t randomly reboot itself, it wakes up from sleep mode quickly, and has a web interface to change it’s settings.Just be aware that when it develops a hardware problem, it leaves you dead in the water and there’s no way to repair it without throwing good money after bad. Maintenance Kit is about $110 and you’ll need to get at least one before your printer dies in the next three years.We have only a couple 8570’s left in the office and with luck, we’ll get through enough of that expensive ink before those remaining printers die. We will not be purchasing any more ColorQubes and are basically just waiting for the remaining ones to die off, which at this rate will be a few months after their factory warranty expires.",0,0

RUQPTPPT767HF,"I originally gave these pencils 4 stars. After using at least 10 of them, I am reducing g the rating to 2 stars.  The lead inside is broken, so when you sharpen, pieces of it come out causing you to have to sharpen sometimes a quarter inch of pencil to get a new point.  Every pencil has this issue.  Despite this, they write well when the lead is sturdy. Other issue is the end with white plastic requires my electric heavy duty pencil sharpener to get past the plastic.  Sharpen easier once past the 1st inch.  Eraser is great! Would rate much higher if so much lead wasn’t wasted.",0,0
R3E88F41YRL4VO,"So here is the real deal. All the bad reviews are because the product is fake. The one on the left is an actual Xacto. The one on the right is a cheap knock off. The blade holder on the authentic one keeps the blade lined up on the sliding mechinism. So when you tighten it down the blade stays locked in the correct orientation. The parts are all different in small ways, but the difference is a great product vs a cheap one that isn't even useable. It's sloppy, loose, and the blade ends up pointing sideways in the handle once tightened. If you look closely all the parts are slightly different. It comes in near perfect packaging too. So if you've never had the real one, you'd think xacto just made a piece of junk. The real one is awesome. I've had 50 different handles for craft knives in the last 40+ years.

Half the time when I try to use it to get into bed or get out of bed the stool will collapse on my. Another issue I found is that it sounds like is going to break any minute and I see the sides start to fold in some times when I hear the noises. This product is rated for 300 lbs and I am only 268 lbs so it should not be behaving this way unless the 300 lbs rating is a lie but I am unable to prove it will hold 300 lbs because I do not want to break it until I find another solution and more sturdier stool.As comparison my wife has a stool in the kitchen that she purchased many years ago, same style and also made of plastic like this one ans that one never makes any noises like is going to break and that one has never collapsed on me while trying to use it.one last note I had this device for a few months I really waited to review so I did it justice and made sure it was not just me being picky.",0,0
REUMC84JITLQ0,"Didn't work in my printer. It let me have hope for the minutes it took to try and calibrate my printer head. Granted, I have an older printer- two actually. One the newer version that had wifi so my dad bought it for me. Two great Kodak printers that have been used maybe 10 times each. I saw this deal and said oh yeah! Here's my money!!! I received the ink quickly- totally will give the seller that. But, didn't have use for the ink until last week when I was trying to print the Christmas pictures.

It's a good ink with amazing color, but lacks the staying power I was looking for. In water, a good amount of it runs and washes away. Other reviews claim that this smearing behavior is a ""security feature"", but Noodler's Black doesn't smear at all after it dries. When exposed to bleach or peroxide, Kingfisher fades a great deal. The remaining marks are still legible, but leave much to be desired.I returned Kingfisher and replaced it with Bad Blue Heron, with which I am much more impressed.",0,0

Maybe I was using 24lb before and this is too light, but I assumed ""copy and print"" meant it was general use.  Anyway, very frustrating as printing is now a nightmare.

I tried the service and figured out that was not for me; but then I had a very hard time cancelling the service. To understand what some of the problems are, I suggest that you google ""how to cancel service for ooma"" to see what kind of problems people have and that this is a problem for a number of people.  In general, the bad parts are:1. you cannot cancel on-line.2. You get a runaround when you call.3. It takes a long time on the phone to cancel.4. They push this idea of giving you a transfer number so that if you sell the device, the person will not have to pay activation fees.  The catch is, if you don't sell it, you get charged for all those months.  They are not very clear about that part.I'd give it a higher rating, as the service seems fine, but I felt like they were trying to trick me and cheat me.Also for the price that has standard features, you might as well get a cell phone from someplace like Republic Wireless that uses WiFi when you are connected, but uses the sprint network otherwise.

R21SR5X1M8ZLDP,"I much prefer the other water brushes I've tried, which are Derwent and Pentel.  They work well and the mechanism is intuitive.  Simply squeeze the soft ergonomic barrel to release water to clean the brush or paint.  The more you squeeze the more water comes out.  it's child's play.  It takes seconds to figure out how much squeezing is necessary.  Filling is a doddle too as you simply unscrew the brush on top and pour water into the barrel, very convenient for filling when out and about plus they hold lots of water so filling is not required often.  With the caps on I've carried these things here and there in a pencil case in my bag for years and never once had an issue with leaking.This Caran D'Ache water pen is a totally different animal.  It looks much more stylish granted and the brand name is known for high end quality so you might be fooled into thinking the product would be better, but think again.The filling mechanism is more trouble than it's worth and the click click method of applying water is a hassle. It's a case of click click click this will take me forever with the amount I need, click oh no, too much and then  I'm trying desperately to get rid of a big blog before it drops on my painting, too late!You literally have to stop painting while you do this clicking process with thumb and index finger also, and the buttons aren't necessarily in the position you would normally be holding the brush either so you have to rearrange your hand each time or permanently paint in an uncomfortable position.Cleaning between colours is an issue also.  With the other brands you can squeeze water out with one or two squeezes that will flush the paint out of the brush, so you have a clean brush between washes.  The Caran D'Ache is not so simple.  With the click click click method of drips you don't get the flush that cleans, instead you get drips that leave you with a dirty brush to use for the next wash.All in all, I would love to give a good review for such an ordinarily high quality brand, but this product has no redeeming features.  Buy the other items and steer clear of this one. It's not fit for purpose in my opinion.",0,0

However, there is a sticker on the front of the turquoise colored stool that very clearly says for up to 320 lbs, NOT 400 as advertised.  NOTE THIS IS FOR SITTING, not for standing on the stool. I wouldn't even let a child stand on this stool!  The ""hinges"" are not held with any kind of plastic or metal pins. Instead, they just snap together and hold with small plastic ""bumps."" Therefore, the stool can completely come apart under weight - and will collapse if you are sitting, or, heaven forbid, standing on it when this happens - very dangerous!  Also, the ""non-skid"" foam dots on the top surface are not especially effective because they are recessed slightly, so although they might provide some slip protection, this would only work if they were exposed so they would make contact with whatever is on top of the stool.

I was able to take my damp Rocketbook cloth to wipe it clean away (all of it) but I find it difficult to lift the color off if I only make a small mistake vs erasing the whole page or larger section with a damp cloth.I thought maybe it was maybe the Rocketbook paper so I figured that I could still use them for my disk planner since I use highlighters in it often and if appointments got canceled or rescheduled then I could just erase the highlighter and pens (I use the FriXion gel pens for my planner) and erase it all.  I had the same issue in my disk planner.  tried it on a variety of different types of paper (notebook, printer, cardstock, heavy) and I found I have the same problem with all of them which is disappointing.  On top of that, some of the color doesn't lift out and leaves a faint coloring on the paper (not in my Rocketbook).  I really wish I knew what type of paper the users used in the review videos where they lifted the color off easily because I did not have that ease of use.  I still have them and I do use them, just only as regular highlighters.",0,0

R2CII92OWL66C4,"Very much unlike Brendon Burchard to put out an incomplete/inefficient product. Brendon usually puts out super high quality stuff. I was surprised by this planner.  The first thing is that there was nothing mentioned on morning ritual. This is a very high priority for Brendon, yet it is absent here. I would have expected at least one page of morning ritual suggestions and guidelines and a spot to put these in the planner. Next I see a weekly review and a monthly review. You see these a lot with all kinds of productivity mavens.  Don't plan weekly AND monthly. Then you end up spending a lot of time doing two review session near the end of the month. It is way more productive to only do weekly reviews. Then when you want to summarize how you are progressing you can choose to take a 4 or 8 or 12 week period or any other period that works for you and review that and see your trends in the categories that matter to you. I changed the whole thing around to fit for me and put it all on a google sheet going forwards week by week for years to come.The main thing is intent (clarity) and the the follow up on that intent by producing on that intent and not other stuff. You can get that from the planner but you do not need this many questions at the beginning and at the end of the day.So while it is not necessarily a 1 star it just took me by surprise that this planner is far less informational and usable than I would have expected coming from BB. his fans will give it an unconditional 5 star but it is not up to par. BB sorry you need to get back to the drawing board on this one despite three years of working on it. I understand it needs to be generic for it to work for everybody but it could be more streamlined and more time efficient. You have to get to the key point fast and drive those. You also need a way to set aside all the distractions.  I keep an area to write down a one or two word note about a distraction item and then I put is away knowing it is written down and I can forget about it until I have excess time to go after some of the minor unimportant non-time sensitive details. LATER is powerful. NOW is even more powerful but only if these are your MAIN priorities. This planner won't get you there efficiently.",0,0

R3O6FYVQUPFYSC,"When I first got the dry erase board, I wasn't impressed.  The letters on the days were already faded and the cork board had several ""bubbles"" in it where it looked like it hadn't been glued to the backing.  Also, one of the round magnets (with the plastic covering you use on the board) did not stick to its plastic backing.  But whatever, I was going to use it anyways.After reading all the other reviews about the poor adhesive on the backing magnets (to stick to your fridge), I decided to super glue the magnets to the back.  HUGE MISTAKE!!!  Now, I'm not blaming anyone but myself for this error - I should have researched a proper glue to use on the back.  I just want to share my experience so it doesn't happen to anyone else.  Well I must have put too much glue or should have used a different glue, because the glue had a chemical reaction to my refrigerator.  Seriously!?!?  I had let the glue dry for at least an hour before putting the board on my fridge. I don't know, I had cleaned the fridge before putting the board on - maybe the glue had a reaction to the chemicals in the cleaner - even though I let both of them dry first?  I'm not sure.  Anyways, my black fridge now has 4 areas where the magnets were that are white (the magnets left rectangle markings).  It looks horrible!  Again, not blaming anyone but myself.  If you are going to glue the magnets to the back, DON'T USE SUPERGLUE.  Find another adhesive.  Anyways, all is not lost - we were planning on replacing the refrigerator this fall anyway and my husband jokes that I sabotaged our fridge on purpose to ensure I would get a new one...lol.Because I glued the magnets on the back and had that horrible reaction, into the garbage it went.

R6VRVJ11KNVKC,"If not for this one big thing, it would be 5 stars++.Be advised. This printer seems like it is a good deal because it comes with a 3000 page ink supply. But BEWARE this ink EXPIRES and is extremely expensive. There is no warning or indication that the included inks EXPIRE.Make no mistake. This printer makes amazing prints. But I am a low volume home user. The printer comes with a '3000' page supply of ink. We print maybe 500 pages / year. We have now owned this printer for about 2 years and have partially consumed about 3/4 of a block of each ink. However, the printer has recently started complaining that there is incompatible ink. I checked this out and was advised that it expired. I spent $600 and bought a set of new ink blocks. I removed the unused blocks (all 4 colors). These cannot be reinserted as is complains that they are expired. Looking at the blocks, there is a different pattern in the 'bumps' that seem to be labeled A thru D.Not to mention that I now have to dispose of my unused ink blocks (4 of them - about $200 worth). And not exactly environmentally friendly and no waste.I hope the new blocks do not 'expire'.If you print >3000 pages/year this is a great deal. For a low volume home user, this is expensive, especially if the regular bought ink also expires. But, if you want the absolutely best print quality you can get. Go for it.

ROOSOKCRMO3RY,"Love my MFC 9970CDW but when it's come to getting replacement toner there's a real problem.  I ordered this toner (gts value pack) based on other reviews but three of the four cartridges leaked and have totally messed up my printer.  (Also, the cleanup is messy and if you're not careful you'll end up breathing in toner ink dust.) I was hoping that these would be as good as Brother toner, which is very expensive. But the replacement toner sold by ""great toners"" is no solution. No reputable company would have such poor quality control and I don't know why Amazon would continue to give this company access to their customer base. After many many orders to Amazon over the years, this is my FIRST negative experience.Note another problem with replacement toner in general:  the MFC is programmed to constantly display a ""low toner"" message if you've installed a non-Brother toner - a real irritant and bad business practice.  This programmed feature is to  force MFC owners to give up on non-Brother toners and just buy Big Brother.

R21D7DZEPWP3UK,I've always known Bostitch as a good brand to say the least. I have to say they really disappoint with this product. First of all when I opened the box and inspected the sharpener I saw wood filings in the cutter. I don't know if they test them first or this was a used and returned item. I'm not giving to stars based on that issue. I'm being generous with two stars based on the price. This sharpener bogs down with the slightest pressure. You have to barely push down to keep it going otherwise it will stop. It also sharpens one side of the pencil leaving the other side covered with wood. As a mechanical person I can tell you it has a cheap weak motor similar to the ones found in cheap toys. I will keep this for now because I really can't be bothered returning things.

They weighed it and said it was fine with one stamp. It weighed 0.7 oz and I didn't need extra postage! What good is this scale if I still have to go to the post office to verify the weight.So I pulled out the instructions and I was relieved (for a short while) that there was a way to calibrate it. You push some button combinations and then put on the 30 lb 0.1 oz weight. That will calibrate it. But wait. Where do I get a 30lb 0.1 oz weight?!?

I had to revert to using the brand name cartridges for my printer and still print quality did not improve to what it was before using them.  Now my printhead has failed and I have to purchase a new printer!  Please beware of using these types of cartridges.These print cartridges are suited for my HP which the website said they were.  Print quality is horrible.  Im beyond my return window as my previous HP cartridges lasted longer than expected.  I just threw them away after only a few printings.  Total waste of money.",0,0

R2G3K4AVN7C60I,I was so excited about this beautiful stamp but unfortunately it doesn’t make impressions as pictured.  Mine NEVER stamps the complete name / address despite always being on a flat & solid surface. I’m so disappointed as there are many gorgeous options in this price range and I chose the one that doesn’t actually do what’s it’s made to do. Giving 2 stars only because the plastic portion is solid and the mechanism works well... just lost the other 3 for the stamp that doesn’t actually stamp.I would submit a photo as an example but with it being an address stamp and all... I won’t.,0,0

R2AJ6AC54NNPQG,"Pillow feels hard and can't determine exactly how to sit in it. When sitting all the way back it cups the glutes in weird way and when move more to the center of the pillow it doesn't allow lumbar spine to be protected by a chair. Coccyx pain a little better when sit in center though not as helpful when sit towards back of cushion. I find it rather high as well. Experiencing a significant increase in T-spine pain perhaps due to alignment/cushion design.  Orthopedic Surgeon recommended a memory foam cut out pillow and that seemed too hard so returned it for this one. My Physical Therapist suggested a donut hole, however most reviews on that indicate they are too wobbly and I need stability. Oh my tushie woes. Sitting for any length of time is excruciating on coccyx and I need to start sitting to build back some lumbar and T-spine muscles following surgery on sacroiliac I had 6 months ago. I am going to bring this pillow to my PT and get her thoughts. As far as helping coccyx, I feel it does help take pressure off, it just feels weird to have to sit in the middle with back unsupported. I'm very small by the way, under 100 lbs. Will write back if PT has any insights to share. Good luck.",0,0

Unfortunately, though, the scale is a huge pain to use: you place an item to be weighed, hit HOLD, then the ""shipper"" button to select the carrier, then the ""service"" button to indicate delivery type. Only then do you see the rate. It then requires three keystrokes to prepare to weigh another item, after which EACH of the steps above must be repeated since the settings aren't persistent from one weighing to the next.

R27L53X89JGWCO,"I went ahead with an order for these peanuts though I was a bit concerned about one reviewer indicating he had received considerably less than advertised.  The order arrived quickly and I was very pleasantly surprised about the shipping.  Rather than being in a bag they were in a sturdy cardboard box.  The external size of the box was four cubic feet and it was jammed packed full of the peanuts.  Making allowance for the inside dimensions of the box, I still received a bit more than the 3.5 cubic feet indicated - there was definitely not a shortage.  Although the order said the seller's name was Bubblefast, the return address on the shipping label said TheBoxery.  Not sure what that means, but it might mean some regional affiliations to reduce shipping costs.  I live near Philadelphia and the shipping point was Ridgewood, NY.  Others in different regions may not receive the same type of package.Incidentally, I priced peanuts at a local office products store and they were over 2.5 times the cost.The above order was placed Nov-2013 and was definitely a five star experience, which is what I rated it at the time.  I placed a second order April-2014 supposedly for the same thing.  However, things were not the same.  This time a company called Starboxes filled the order from somewhere in Florida.  The package only contained 2-1/2 cubic feet instead of the 3-1/2 that was ordered.  And, that package was a flimsy bag instead of a sturdy box.  Because of the shortage, I changed the rating from five stars to one star.  I find it totally unacceptable for the order to be short by almost 30%.As a follow up note to the second purchase, I complained to the seller.  It took a several emails back and forth plus a picture of the bag as received, but they agreed to refund the prorata share for the missing amount.  The person I exchanged emails with stated that the picture showed the bag had come open at the top and some had spilled out.  I am a bit doubtful about that because adding another cubic foot to that bag probably would not allow it to be closed.As a result of the refund, I have upgraded my rating to two stars.

Setting that aside, the real flaw in the design relates to the impact plate which creates the fold in the staple after it drives through the paper to be stapled.  At some point about 9 months in, it just stopped  bending the staples correctly, and each and every staple was a jam, not in the usual sense.  The staple would be driven through, but then on the backside, the staple would not be folded in on itself. Instead it was just jammed straight back, usually breaking the staples in half.  Basically the stapler no longer works at all.  I am using the Swingline Optima staples.  I reached out to Swingline Customer support.  After week of not hearing back from them, I have decided to simply post this review.  Swingline had the opportunity to reply, but chose not to, after all it's a $33 item, and I am but a single customer.  Poorly designed stapler, combined with nonexistent customer support equates to a company not worth remembering.",0,0
R3POCE5HYGUXK6,"Have bought many carts from Inkjetcorner over the years.  Good prices but I have finally had it with the defect rate.  Usually 1-2 are defective in each shipment- leaking, not recognized, etc.  But in the last batch all were defective.  Will not seat- not recognized.  Using tape to hold them down- still 1/2 won't work.The ""good prices"" evaporate when 1/2 of them or more are defective and have to be thrown away.Just one person's opinion, but I wouldn't buy from them.

R13IEZRFO9LYTN,"Well I read the reviews and took a chance and ordered one.  Not sorry I did; but mot entirely happy either.  First:  unit arrived earlier than expected...thats a plus.  When I took it out of the box I heard ‘rattling ‘ inside the counter.  The online description said ‘starter pack’ of coin wrappers.  If by starter pack they meant 4-pennies wrappers, then yeah, mission accomplished.  On to the machine itself:  its easy to set up, rather ‘quiet’ for a coin counter.....and yes; it jams....a lot.  I opened the back of the machine to clear a jam and found ‘small chunks of hard plastic’ in with the stuck coins.  Something on the inside broke off and had been spinning around with the coins.  The machine runs ‘ok’, but I have to only put small amonts of coins in the hopper at a time.  Definitely not worth the money.  Would have been better off with a manual counter.",0,0
R1EY43HXTO0ASF,"Pros:  I was impressed with the ease of putting the stand together.  All parts were well marked with small ABC labels - and the labels were either on the underside or in a place where you wouldn’t see them if you didn’t remove them once the unit was put together.  I think I checked every assembly point and from what I could tell, the stand only goes together one way and I really liked that.  There was very little verbiage on the instructions and it was almost all pictures (which isn’t really a pro or con).  The cart rolls really nicely.Cons:  The top is actually in 3 pieces and they do not completely meet because of the underneath supporting bracket.  More importantly, the supporting bracket does NOT hold the top level at all.  I saw that another reviewer suggested using washers and I tried that, but it’s still not level and I’m afraid that it I add more, the screws won't support the top.",0,0

After using this for a couple of weeks I have found some serious issues with it.  The ""C"" clamp that holds the compass together gets looser the more you use it and this causes the compass to become unstable when it is opened more than half way.  I was able to tighten the ""C"" clamp for now but this will be an issue throughout the life of the item.  The little screws that hold the the lead and needle in place also come undone very easily.

RSNYQSBDF193M,"I got this to replace an old thrift store Boston sharpener that finally stopped working, after allowing me to dissemble and service it a few times before it gave up the ghost.  This vertical Bostitch worked well for several months and could sharpen both standard and colored pencils. And the primary users were my kids. But then one day it quit working. And I tried to take it apart to service it for clogs, wax buildup, or whatever the problem was, but this thing was not made to be serviced or troubleshooted. It is what companies would call disposable. That was disappointing for me. I was hoping that with a little TLC, it would work again, but it's design makes that impossible. To replace it, today I paid about 30 for the X-acto School Pro. While it is not supposed to sharpen colored pencils, this model can handle different sizes of pencils AND is the company made it serviceable and refurbishable with replacement cutters. There are a couple of versions from Bostitch that have the option of having a replacement cutter that I seriously considered, including EPS10HC and EPS11HC. But based on reviews, I went with X-acto for a replacement for this vertical Bostitch. And after visiting with X-acto on the phone I learned that they will be releasing a new version of the School Pro and Teacher Pro that can handle colored pencils too.To get back to this sharpener it is inexpensive and works great UNTIL it doesn't work at all. If you have no qualms about not being able to unclog or service it on your own and are fine with buying a new one every so often, then this is good choice. But if you want to do some basic troubleshooting and have the option of replacement cutters, look elsewhere.",0,0

R1ACPFYFM6SL7L,"If I had written about the Tdbest Highback Mesh Office Chair while I was attempting to assemble it or trying to decipher its operation I would tell any interested buyer to find another chair.  In fact I am still not certain that I have correctly attached the back to the seat or the headrest to the back,  or if I have the armrests on backwards – for some reason they wobble but they do that even if you reverse them.The horrible instruction sheet is good for a laugh and thankfully not representative of the overall engineering and workmanship.  The instructions consist of a single 12 x 8 inch sheet,  which is blank on the back.  The instructions are not so much written directions as crudely drawn illustrations each of which would need little reduction to be fit on a microdot.  The tiny font with part's names is too small to read without magnification.  Yet when you magnify the parts list you get the bad news that two washers on the list are missing,  there is an open spot in the shrink wrapped panel containing the other washers and bolts.  This is cause for alarm until you magnify the other six images and realize that it is impossible from the crude drawing to be sure exactly where these should be placed.The missing washers are easy to miss because they are simply taped inside the flap of the chair's cardboard box,  with no effort made to indicate that they can be found there.  If you logically concluded that they were purposely not included and assembled the chair without them you will later be faced with the exciting chore of using a rubber mallet to pound out the gas cylinder that fuses to the base when inserted.All that said,  the materials and craftsmanship appear first rate and the value is probably comparable to other chairs in this price range.

R1O910I0TA6S5D,**UPDATE - September 2016** Just threw away 4 more pens for leakage and lowered my rating to one star.Sorry but these are pure JUNK!I've purchased several sets of gel pens over the last few years and these performed the worst out of all of the those sets.  A lot of the colors skipped or didn't color at all.  A few of the caps would not stay on and fell off inside the little bag I kept them in and a few exploded. Having said that my purchase was not a complete loss.  Some actually managed to do a good job and performed beautifully but not enough of them for me to make another purchase or even recommend.  From the amount of 4 and 5 stars this product received I would have expected a far better product.,0,0
RYGAE5X5H1KDI,I’ve never had this happen to any high end ballpoint let alone a Mont Blanc. I realized it must have started to crack after 7 months as it was not writing as smoothly. But just today I couldn’t twist it shut and it just fell apart. Never getting again unless it’s Amazon Prime. Very bad quality. I just ordered from a genuine seller authorized by Mont Blanc that offer a 2 year Warranty and serial # with certificate which can be checked online with 100% money back guarantee. I cannot even contact my seller 5 Star Brands since probably they no longer are on Amazon.,0,0
R15FJT2MD4MXEA,I like the size and it is a really comfy fit in my hand. the trigger to light it is easy to pull (even with my arthritis) however I was really excited about the flame lock that claims you can use it for over 30 mins with it locked. mine doesnt work. whenever i try to lock it the flame just stops. I tried before lighting and while lit. it just doesnt work. such a bummer. there is also no button to press to unlock the torch so if it is hanging out in your bag without something on the handle ( it comes with a small black plastic piece to fit over the trigger (easily lost)) it could get bumped and light potentially starting a fire. just be aware.if the torch lock had worked i most likely would have given this torch 5 stars.,0,0
R2BHJG5Z0IIXRW,"Bought this unit for my Mother as a gift sometime ago and within six months it stopped working all together!Whats ironic about this unit is that whoever sets it up (me for example) it only works for! Giving this as a gift it was annoying when it only would recognize things (which it barely did) from my own voice versus my Mothers voice which it had an extremely hard time doing. The lists were ok but they never were that useful to be honest. Also it takes WAY MORE TIME to actually create a list than to write it down.The real reason why I give this a two star rating (and believe me that is generous) is because when you purchase this item it comes with batteries, and for a couple bucks more and so I thought piece of mind i bought the extended warranty. To my dismay the unit stopped working (reasons unknown) and the batteries that were included in the box leaked causing more concern. Upon calling the company to complain and try and get a replacement i find out that battery leakage is not covered by the warranty even if they supplied them, also the replacement fix fee was almost as much as the product to begin with.Needless to say Brookstone and there products lack quality and in my opinion are one heck of a scam company. Will never recommend or buy another product from there again! Do yourself a favor and write down your own lists and save the headache and money!",0,0

R19FU34ZKPC3FE,"I'm used to gel but reviewers said foam was good too.  I found the foam wrist pad feeling very warm, and my wrist was sinking in more than I life. So back to gel.But the other thing was ugh, the pad part started showing scruffy marked up areas within minutes. I have an optical Logitech mouse that I keep very clean. One plus of a new mouse mat after many years of good service with the old one was that it would look fresh and clean. It was clear this one was going to look rode hard and put away sweaty very quickly.The pad is a very thin lightweight foam-- it tracked well enough, but it is annoying in not just laying down flat right away. It might relax over time, but the under side where it did lay down near the wrist pad is not in any way sticky so it slides a bit too easily on a wood desk top for my taste.This is all probably just personal preferences-- can't say the product is defective in any way, so it might suit someone else very well.",0,0

It has a glitch in printing where the copies come out a jumbled mess of smudged print along the edges and completely white over about 85% of the center of the page.  I removed the cartridge and had to manually move the wheel that appeared to be stuck, then it prints fine.  Only draw back to that fix is it repeats the problem at random and this morning (for the second time) it ruined an entire batch of coupons my wife prints to buy groceries...in a typical shopping trip she saves between $50-75 per store.

REWAWDC49JWKI,"I'm looking at my Amazon ink orders and how the cheap but highly functional ""off-brand"" ink lasts me over 6 months, and then I thought to order a set of the more expensive HP ink which ran out at about 7 weeks, not a cost-effective move.Even if the off-brand ink eventually messes up the printer (which it does not appear to do), it's cheaper to replace the printer than to keep using HP ink. And I agree with another reviewer, that the HP automatic ink refill program is a rip off—unless you want to make it yet another priority in your life to either stay on top of your HP ink use and pages you print with it, or pay HP for all the ink service.

R2X638H5X9R2CR,"I bought a set of the two compartment meal prep containers to take lunches to work, on road trips, etc. The glass container itself is very heavy and sturdy and easy to clean, but on day one I have two main issues:The lids are a flimsy cheap plastic, on the level of the disposable containers from the dollar store. They warp and bend easily and are the kind of oily feeling plastic that stains and holds smells. The seal is glued into the lid and can't be removed for cleaning so any food particles that get in there will never come out. You can't put these lids in the microwave or oven, though some other reviews say you can freeze them.The divider in the glass container only goes halfway up, defeating the purpose of having it at all. If the container tilts at all the contents of the two compartments spill into each other. The container is awkwardly large and does not fit into most lunch boxes unless you tip it on its side, at which point it's pretty much one container. If I had seen these containers first I would never have bought them and I will avoid this brand in the future. You can get much better containers for less money from several other brands.

RF9U2JBVLT9GN,"This was on sale, and the idea of real wood vs. particle board was appealing. I should have known better.First, it is small. I knew this going in, and wanted a smaller unit, so no problems there for me, but if you are looking for a lot of storage, I would look elsewhere.Now the problems:On unpacking it, I noticed that the boards felt very light - they are pine, but they might as well be balsa wood. I decided to give it a shot rather than returning it immediately.On the very first step, placing the wheels into one of the bottom support  boards split it in half down the middle. This was while following the instructions to use padding when putting the hardware in. I requested a replacement piece from the manufacturer, which took two 2 weeks.Once I finally got that back, I picked up assembly where I left off. The wood is so soft that you have to be extremely careful not to overt tighten screws (even by hand), because it can drive the screws too deep into the attached boards and cause chips and cracks.The next thing to go wrong was placing the top on. The holes were not aligned correctly and one of the wooden dowels was too thick, so it was a struggle getting it attached. Just applying force to seat the top correctly created a new crack in the top.Attaching the back to the cabinet and the bottoms to the drawers involves driving small nails into narrow strips of wood. These are much too small, and even a slight miscalculation results in the nails splitting the wood or coming out of the side. Again, the wood is much too soft, so splitting chips out even with these tiny nails is a real possibility.Finally, even after making sure everything was square as per the instructions, the cart wobbles, and all of the drawers stick at points sliding them in and out.I like the concept of using real wood but this is just not well designed, not is it sturdy enough. I saw a reviewer is putting their printer on it - I would not trust this unit to bear up under more than a couple of pounds. To be fair, it's only rated for 10lbs on top - which should give you some idea how flimsy it really is.Save yourself some headaches, and get something a bit more expensive - better that than the frustration of assembling this and the frankly poor end result.",0,0

R3LEYIGG4L0RWS,"I really like these pens.  The colors are great.  The only drawback I've had is that some of them tend to be ""scratchy"" and don't color as smoothly as I'd like.UPDATE  Right after I posted this review, I heard from the supplier.  In order to make things right, he offered to replace the scratchy pens at no cost, plus I didn't need to return the original set of pens.  I am still waiting for the replacement pens.  That's why I dropped him to 4 stars.  I even tried to get in touch with him via e-mail without any luck.UPDATE #2As of today, I haven't heard anything from this supplier.  I'm dropping them to one star.  I'm stuck with these pens.  Don't waste your time or MONEY!!",0,0

RH9QYNGELYZGA,"These are expensive and it (SILVER PAINT) worked great right out of the box.When I started using it, I gave it a 5⭐️review.After all, I do love SHARPIE markers.HOWEVER, after a few months, the tip wouldn't pass paint anymore and the paint simply blobs and drips out of the wick❗️Even if the fine-tip has paint in it, something is plugging up the very end of the tip so that the paint will not transfer onto the item you are writing on.Other reviewers have shared similar experiences.The tip works as two pieces:A thicker paint-absobing cylindrical ""wick"" fits into the metal cup holding the fine-tip-wick.  By drepressing the tip into marker, paint is suppused to get wicked up and flow into the fine-point-tip where you can use it like a pen.It works very well, AT FIRST.The entire wick-tip assembly became so loose that it easily popped off of the marker when trying to clean it.Shaking; dabbing; trying different angles; nothing would get the fine-tip to smoothly run the paint anymore after less than 9 months of ownership.The marker shakes just fine, and the paint is very fluid.BUT NOW THE PAINT SIMPLY FLOWS AROUND THE BIG WICK AND DRIPS A BIG BLOP OF PAINT DOWN AND OVER THE FINE-POINT.It uses very little paint when working, so it can last for a very long time, BUT WHAT GOOD IS IT IF IT WON'T WORK AFTER A FEW USES?I tried cleaning the fine-point-tip with alcohol.It cleaned up perfectly, it absorbed paint again, but it still wouldn't flow properly through the tip as it did when first purchased.It seems as if the end of the tip hardens and acts like a plug on the paint trying to flow through it.Either way, WHAT IS WRONG WITH THESE THINGS!",0,0
R2SXANG02Z3NB2,"It's very hard to ""at a glance"" see which child is supposed to do what chore. Two of the colors are so close in coloring that it's very difficult to determine who is who. It wouldn't be a problem if you could dictate to your children which colors they could use (and if you didn't need all four colors for four children): however, my three chose their own colors and of course two of them are closely matched. I find myself spending too much time looking at it to try and determine who is supposed to be doing what. If the stars were bigger and of different colors - perhaps this would be a good choice. I also purchased other chore charts which I like much better (they are for each individual child) - but I still need one for those chores that they share during the week.",0,0

RSGLQ6FY4O383,"Took a while for these to get here, but hey, this is the price you pay when you're too lazy and cheap to go to your friendly neighborhood office supply store and get brand new ones yourself.  Some people call that cheap... we like to call it thrifty around here.  This is a situation where thrifty didn't pan out quite as expected...Our black ink cartridge was the only thing that had run out at the time I placed this order, although the others were starting to get low.  Being the savvy planner I am, I decided it would be best to stock up on everything all at once, since printers have a tendency to run out of ink at the most inopportune times and I wanted to have them on standby.  After we replaced the black cartridge, it worked fine for printing 5 sheets of paper.  Then, the lines started.  And they got worse and worse and worse, to the point where you couldn't read anything being printed.  Finally, we reserved ourselves to the fact that it had to be a dud, and we replaced it with the other one.  It now prints gray instead of black... but hey, at least it's printing text that is actually readable (how's THAT for the silver lining in the cloud?).When we tried to replace the color cartridges with these new ones, oh the delight that we were able to experience.  The ink leaked EVERYWHERE.  It dripped on the carpet and stained fingers.  Since this happened last weekend and Easter is this upcoming weekend, I came up with the explanation if anyone asked that it was an accident dying Easter eggs.  Thankfully, no one asked.  I can't imagine the looks we would've gotten considering that we are two grown adults with no young children.  I'm still trying to get the ink out of the carpet and it took a few days for the skin to return to it's natural hue.  We have the same problem with the color cartridges as the original black cartridge - there are lines everywhere from the ink not printing properly.  The silver lining with the color cartridges?  The color is a nightmare to get of the carpet and off the skin, so at least you know it's good quality.I wouldn't recommend these cartridges at all.  There were so many other positive reviews that I can't understand what happened here.  All I know is that we won't be ordering any more of them.",0,0

This fixed it for a few days, rinse and repeat...  Each time it became harder and harder to get this cartridge to print anything, eventually it just stopped and I couldn't get it to work.

RXZAND5FLR8WD,"I bought this ink because I visited their booth at the Commowealth Pen Show, but they didn’t allow testing of their inks or pens at the show (go figure) and I didn’t feel they did their job selling the product. So I purchased from amazon. This ink does not work well for pointed nib calligraphy. The ink bleeds terribly even in good 32# paper. I also purchased a black one if this brand and it performs well. It is not water fast at all. I also used it in a medium fountain pen (rotring and Lamy) and was also a poor performer.As you can see from the pictures, I compared 4 inks on the back of a good quality envelope that usually takes calligraphy inks quite well. The black Noodler’s ink is perfect, the Bad Belter Kingfisher was terrible.  The Winsor and Newton had a little bit of feathering and the Pelican was ok. I waited 1 minute and then placed one drop of water. You can see the Kingfisher starts spreading right away while the black one kept its fastness. After 1 minute All but the black ink were ruined.I read great reviews of these inks and now I am confused if they are all different formulations and there’s not a lot of description on the box or the bottle.",0,0

R3SN7TVBQPRANX,Not sure why this has such high reviews. It doesn't apply flat and there are HUGE bubbles no matter what I do. Probably has something to do with the fact that the roll wasn't very flat to begin with. I unrolled almost the whole tube and weighed down the edges to try and flatten it some. There were folds in the roll that stayed no matter what I did. Still got 2 stars because its a wonderful idea and the adhesive is so damn good that I couldn't peel it back after placing it without warping the sheeting. Both a good and a bad thing since the whole point is to be able to apply it to basically any surface. I would have liked to lift it back up in small amounts to remove whatever bubbling I could.,0,0

RDM0YNNEWQ240,"I like the intentionality that this type of planner can support, but there are too many mistakes and poor design desicisions to have this work for me ... so I’m heading to other alternatives on the market.This is not a yearly, weekly or monthly planner. It is only focused on looking ahead each day. There are sections for weeks and months but those are retrospective and not forward-looking.The weekly review has many very detailed questions that are phrased, oddly, in reference to “today” versus “this week.” It appears to be a quality-control oversight. Also, the detail level of those questions are indeed more appropriate for a daily review than a weekly review, so it looks like they’ve taken a daily review list from another iteration of the design and slapped it into the weekly review section.As other reviewers have said, there is a lot of real estate on each page dedicated to the daily schedule, while the other areas are quite cramped, and the daily schedule only goes up to early evening.The difference between “Today’s Top 3 Goals/Priorities” and “Tasks that Absolutely Must Be Done Today” is not clear. The author has a video where he addresses this and criticizes those who could be confused by this, going on to give a very vague and not really credible description of the difference.When I contacted the company’s customer service email about some of these issues, they were evasive and pointed me to a facebook group of “Brandon’s Students.”Finally, I’m not a big fan of self-proclaimed gurus who are marketing their stuff by saying “you too can be as productive as me.”Onward to Panda Planner Pro or another option.

R3AWRJMKQ3QGO2,"Pros:1. It is made of wood.2. Great for a DYI project!!!3. it is technically a drawer.4. It is very aromatic!5. You are saving those rejected wood scraps from your lumber yard!Cons:1. By made of wood, it really means the rejected wood pieces from the lumberyard. You know when you pick up lumber from your local place and you toss out a bunch of those pieces, those get marked down and the worse gets left behind, yep those pieces. You will be hard pressed to find any piece that is not full of knots and warped in some way (and leaking a bit of sap, how authentic!). At least they picked the lightest, softest, and easiest to break or split wood they could find, to save on shipping costs of course.2.  If you thought you were buying a ready to assemble drawer, well you might be disappointed. For instance they really don't tell you about all the tools you will really need: A good drill with a screw driver attachment, a square, glue, a couple of hammers, some extra nails, two or three good grades of sand paper, two cans of clear coat, and a good amount of patience. This would have been better described as a DYI kit, and by DYI I mean drill your own holes and figure out how to put it together yourself. I know there are some 5 star reviews out there... but I am not sure how this made them that happy... maybe they got it free or something.3. There appears to be ZERO quality assurance since about 40% of the holes they did actually drill were in the wrong spots making the simple task of hammering in the cheap plastic drawer slides, yep for that real wood experience they couldn't afford to toss in real drawer slides. But hey good thing I was able to fill that hole and re-drill another one! I really don't think that any of this was sanded, or I am just very unlucky with finding stray splinters.4. If you were expecting this bad boy to be painted, you are missing that true 100% wood DYI experience! More like one coat of spray on black primer. Combined with the unique softness of a true hardwood like pine even slight dings bring out the true rich tones of tan.5. As an extra bonus you get a fancy big sticker on the back piece of... particle board that refused to let loose without a ton of scraping and adhesive removal (at least they used glue here). Apparently that sticker is very important as it reminds you that the drawers cannot hold more than 10 pounds.In conclusion, skip the real wood experience and buy a drawer that yes, might be made with pressed wood, but also comes fully finished with mechanical drawers and doesn't leak sap!",0,0

R140CV744P7CIQ,"This scale was purchased to integrate with WorldShip so that we wouldn't have to type in the weight of every single package. The integration went fine (a small ""hack"" in a bin file had it up and running fast).But, there's one major problem with this scale - it doesn't display accurate weights. The manual states that accuracy can fluctuate +/- 4 oz, which is a problem in itself for shipping purposes (since everything rounds up for billing), but the variances are far greater than 4 oz. The heavier the package, the more the variance. We've run into instances where the weight displayed was more than 4 lb off. That might not seem like a big deal at ground shipping rates, but a difference that high when using an air service and shipping to a residential address can result in tens of dollars in shipping rate differences.After about a month of 20 page shipping company invoices with rate adjustments due to inaccurate weights, we promptly tossed this thing in the trash.",0,0

R2AJGCMTIOMV3W,I normally only write reviews when I get a truly bad product. This is one of those reviews. This product is very confusing to assemble.

R3J20N2RT9P2YW,"There were a few Smash accessories I wanted and I bought a kit that came with most of them and a few extras, including a ""free"" larger book.  I say ""free"" because the kit cost less than buying the accessories I wanted individually, so I looked at the other items as freebies on top of a good price.The Smash Swatch Tape was one of the items I wanted to add some variety to the black polka dot tape, which I love.  Now, I'm glad I got the swatch tape as part of the kit and I consider the cute clips part of what I bought and the Swatch Tape a freebie so I don't feel bad that I threw it away.  As was true with several reviewers here, the tape stuck to the next layer, ruining that layer and split apart as I tried to take it off the roll.  VERY disappointing and very poor quality.  I expected that the Swatch Tape would be the same material as the black dot paper tape.  So I pitched the useless roll of Swatch Tape and I'll buy Trendy Tape from Queen and Company dot com.

R20WDW9T0Z254U,"I wasn't quite sure what to expect from these, for the price.  But this is a case of paying a premium for a name, not for anything physically worth it.These are just your normal, standard notebooks, with cardboard covers that will bend and crease and wear just like any others, marring the pictures pretty quickly in any normal school use.  Seeing what my 11 year old son ends up with for his notebooks and folders in the course of just a month or two, these wouldn't make the grade.New, they do look nice.  Bright colors, well done, no blurring, the print job is excellent.  The paper is pretty standard, perforated if you prefer the clean edge rather than the ragged one you get just pulling out from the spiral.But others have already pointed out how much cheaper these can be found singly, so the three pack is definitely not worth the price.And if these are going to go to little kids, which is the most likely candidate since these are kind of ""kid"" quality art being Star Wars Rebel cartoon images (i.e. you won't get an adult Star Wars fan using these for anything), then these really won't have much of a chance at longevity.If you need notebooks for your kid for school, these aren't the ones I'd pick.  If you need something for around the house for them though, something that won't be in and out of backpacks and desks and lockers, then these may hold their form and looks for a while.  But I'd definitely not use them as ones getting packed back and forth each day",0,0

R1UHDPV0B83W4N,I just cannot understand how this pen is rated so highly.Like others I bought the pen based upon the many glowing recommendations for a beginners fountain pen.Overall the writing experience is v poor:(i) the fine pen nib continually runs dry. I am using the converter with Lamy Crystal Black Ink.There are no air bubbles in the converter and I have to violently shake the pen to generate ink flow and end up with ink blots on the paper(ii) Super scratchy. I am mean ultra scratchy. The idea of the fountain pen is to glide over the page effortlessly.This is made worse by the tendency of the nib to run dry.(iii) Posting the pen.When writing the pen feels more balanced when the cap is fitted to the back of the pen. However it fits v poorly. Not nice and snug at all.It either ends up rattling on the end of the pen as your write or you have to post it so tightly it is difficult to get off when you are finished.(iv) The paint is so thin any small scratch reveals the shiny aluminium underneath.This is especially noticeable  at the end of the pen because you have to press so hard to firmly post the cap it wears the paint from the end of the pen.The Lamy AL Star is one of the most expensive beginners fountain pen but the experience and build quality feels v cheap and nasty to me.,0,0

I guess I was wrong, and that the problem persists with many of the products that are shipped, at least it was the case with mine.

When I contacted customer service they said that this was the intended design and that pens clip to the outside.I've never seen a pen loop in a folio case require the pen to be outside of it, poor design if you ask me.

She thought it was a pretty decent pen that was more comfortable to hold and use compared to the pens she's been using.  She likes the purple/blue color of the pen and the quality of the ink, but it started leaking after only a couple of uses.

I had the pleasure of sitting down and reviewing my receipts for both items today, shipped seperately of course, and was a bit baffled. Both of these items were sold for a reasonable price for about $7. Here's where my anger lies: Amazon sent me the ADDRESS SERVICE REQUESTED Rubber Stamp and the shipping & handling was free...and ""NO"" to all of the website sleuths out there; it WAS NOT part of any large purchase over $25 including free shipping. However, this company that my daughter purchased the RETURN TO SENDER Rubber Stamp from chose to charge her/me about $6 for shipping & handling alone.

R2P1L1OD77A9ET,"I wanted to love these pens... I really did. The price was so incredible, when I ordered them. I read so many other reviews, but thought, hey, if I dont like them, it's less than a $20 bill, right? I ignored the negative reviews and ordered anyway. One swipe, and I knew these would not be suitable for beginner to intermediate hand lettering. Not even a little bit. I played with them (along with some water) for about an hour, and that was it. They were frustrating, and I knew they weren't for me. So, they were passed on to my daughter, who has dabbled in water color painting lately. I had no doubt she would love and want to keep them. Even SHE said I should return them. And so I shall. Why? Briefly...First, the results differ from pen to pen.  One pen might write fairly dark. The next will be nearly dry. And on and on. Second, the tips are literally brushes, not nylon ""brush"" tips. They're impossible to control for hand lettering, unless you're a pro. Third, bristles were loose and/or falling out. And less important, but still a factor --the packaging, as some have mentioned, is terrible. And on top of being awkward and flimsy, the outer sleeve of mine arrived broken and somewhat mangled. This is possibly (read: likely) the fault of the shipping facility, so that did not factor into my rating.  Don't do what I did, in ignoring the other reviews.

But I began to see streaking in the colors that I printed, which was unaffected by running a cleaning cycle on the printer, changing paper, changing print quality, etc.  After some quick research online, I learned that a common cause of this is cheaply made toner cartridges.  After changing the cartridge, VOILA!  Smooth printing again.

R1RG1QLYOBRBR,"I bought Liquid Bearings to use on my computer trackball.  When my trackball was new, it rolled perfectly.  Over time I've had to exert more effort to get the ball rolling, which results in jerky movement.  The manufacturer no longer makes my trackball or sells replacement parts, so I thought I'd lubricate the bearings to see if it would help.I first tried skin oil (like from my forehead).  It only helped for a few hours.  I had the same result with olive oil, coconut oil, teflon gun oil, and even polishing the ball with RainX.  Nothing seemed to work for more than a few hours at best.  I even made sure to thoroughly clean the ball between each test.Enter Liquid Bearings.  It received a lot of great reviews and they mention on their site that it's good for arcade machines.  Since many arcade machines have trackballs, I thought it might work.It doesn't.It didn't help at all.  In fact, it made it much much worse.  It also smelled.  They claim it has no odor, but it does.  It's not overpowering, but it's there.Since every other oil I tried worked better, but since it may still be useful for oiling hinges or other stuff in the future, I think 2/5 stars is what it deserves.

It would be very good for a little old person who cannot carry anything at all.  Or someone who would just shop for 6 things and wanted to push a cart instead of carry a bag.Also, it is made in China and the wheels smell like gasoline.",0,0
R3O7IPQ7VIILDM,"I had high hopes for this planner, and did extensive research prior to taking the plunge to the Cossac planner from Erin Condren, which has been my stalwart partner in productivity for many years. Unfortunately, despite having the exact layout that I’ve been looking for (separate monthly, weekly, and daily sections) and the exact daily agenda design that I wanted, this planner is incredibly disappointing. The pages are so thin that even the lightest pens bleed through. Unless you write in pencil (with a light hand) this planner is likely not for you. I’m using standard Flair pens, not permanent markers and I’ve never had them bleed through a planner like this. I was all in for this to be my perfect holy grail planner and instead, I’m angry because I wasted 20$ on a planner and then wasted planner stickers in it before realizing how thin the pages are. If I had not already written/used stickers in it, I’d be asking for a refund.If I could give 0 stars I would. Ideal layout is 100% overshadowed by crappy paper.",1,1
R1L8P6YRUZ389D,Note pad arrived with the magnetic strip adhered on the cardboard back at the geometric center of the cardboard (unlike some that I see in the reviews where the magnetic strip is positioned along the top edge of the back).  This makes the note pad useless to hang on the fridge since the cardboard is too light to remain flat against the fridge due to the weight of the pad (at least the magnet does its job).  Two stars.  Decided to tear the cardboard back off and keep the note pad on the counter.,0,0

R1S09IEQ7O176O,My daughter loves this calender and looks forward to updating it every month. However as a parent this product was shipped in bad shape. I should have had Amazon send another. This had to have been sitting around the warehouse for a few years. The boards themselves were very warped. The magnets with the years on them were for years 2009 - 2013. I bought this in 2011. A few weeks after getting this for my daughter we bought one for a friend as a birthday gift from a local store. The boards were nice a straight - no warping and the magnetic years started at 2011. The identical item but in much better shape. I guess I blame Amazon for sending something out that was in bad shape and apparently sitting around for a few years. If not for it being old and in bad condition I would have given it 5 stars.,0,0

R2P4QOOLH5EVPZ,"I really did not enjoy working with these pencils. I found them really chalky (pieces of lead were breaking on my page), the color didn't fill in or build up easily, and I personally did not enjoy using a triangular barrel. I honestly prefer Crayola over these, which are cheaper and easily found in most stores.I also found that the wood on these were very soft and would just peel back from the lead. I'm not sure if that affects anything, though it was odd.Overall I really did dislike these pencils.  I hate the page I started so much that as of now I don't plan to finish it.  I would never buy these again and I would not recommend them.  The pictures I added show some fine detail that I used gel pens for,  but mainly it is just the use of these pencils.

These two sections take about 40% of the two-page daily spread. Way too much, in my opinion.I do however like the weekly two-page weekly review.

R1O0L1TOQP5V14,"The following is my review for this brand's toner that I purchased with the drum.  Since the drum and the toner work together and I can't pinpoint which of the two items (or both) are causing my issues, I'm simply copying and pasting my toner review here:""I felt compelled to write this review:  Sometimes when a see a couple of negative reviews, but the majority of reviews are good, I decide to take a chance and purchase.  This was the case here, but it was a mistake.  The other negative reviews regarding leaking are absolutely correct.  Here was my experience:I saw this brand on sale when it was the ""Deal of the Day.""  I have a Brother MFC-8950DW, so I purchased the matching toner and drum unit.  At first, the printing appeared nice.  However, the toner smudges VERY easily.  So, when I went to scan various documents, the toner smudged and I had to reprint almost 100 pages and then rescan them.  This wasted about 30 minutes of my time.  However, the worst happened a couple of days after installing the toner and drum...the toner began leaking.  There were blotches of toner over the paper.  Based on another reviewer stating that the leaking ruined his printer, I quickly removed the toner and drum and replaced it with the original drum and toner I had, since there was some life left in them.  The blotches continued for the next 5-10 pages or so, but then stopped...thank goodness!When packaging up the toner and drum to return to Amazon, the toner leaked out and covered my hands.So, if you are on the fence like I was regarding this company and their printer accessories, do yourself a huge favor and don't make the same mistake I did by taking a chance.  Stay far away!It's too bad because the Brother accessories are so overpriced.  I tried another off-brand toner with the Brother drum (this is the toner I was aiming to replace), but the printing is much lighter than the Brother toner.  At least it isn't leaking, though.  So, I still haven't found off-brand Brother accessories with quality equivalent to the Brother accessories.  At this point, I'm thinking about ponying up the money for the Brother-branded items since right now I'm paying the price of wasting my time and dealing with cruddy-quality prints in exchange for saving some money up front on the items themselves.""",0,0

I really would not recommend buying it at all. When it came apart at a busy intersection, I abandoned it because I couldn't take it anymore.",0,0
R1X886S500EI7H,Would prefer to give it no stars.  A piece of junk.  Do not waste your money.  Pre-drilled holes did not match up and the metal connectors are made of a soft metal that they bend.  Don't bare any weight on this as it will topple over if it doesn't break beforehand.,1,1

R2MFMO3W60TR9T,"This was my second one of these and now I am fed up enough to write a review. The product is a great idea overall, it is just not durable. The metal line and the sturdy feel are great, but the reeling component (the most important part) has broken quickly and often. After numerous repair jobs, my second one of these finally crapped out and I am done with them. The cheaper ones with thin string line last much longer. Do yourself a favor, save the money and frustration, just buy a cheaper one.",0,0

When you put it under the flap, it's good but along the way, pieces of paper flakes fall on the floor and when you get to the end of the envelope, it doesn't glide all the way, you have to force it to the end.

R2ROUDDMEUWMUO,"I would never have thought I would have to write this review. I love this company, and I have ordered their beautiful calendars for many years. No more. As I was filling in the early part of 2018 and looking through the rest of the pages, I noticed that all the Jewish holidays were missing. I wrote the company, thinking that surely that was an oversight, since many holidays not even celebrated in the U.S.were listed. As I never got a response from the company, I called them. I thought surely they would need to do a reprint. I was told that I got the Catholic calendar, and that is the only calendar without the Jewish holidays. Now this particular calendar has Bible verses (which is the main reason I ordered it), from Psalms and Proverbs as well as the New Testament. I was floored at her answer. I said that Scripture verses are not exclusively Catholic, and that I am not Catholic or Jewish either, but I am appalled. She said they make over 70 calendars and that this is the only one without the Jewish holidays. I told her that she was not making this conversation go any better,  that I am the wife of a Messianic Jew, and we are both shocked and appalled. Anti-Semitism has no place here. From now on, I will choose another company.",0,0
R3NJOOKYVLWDIF,"I purchased two of these cartridges a little less than a year ago, so this review speaks volumes about the longevity of this product.When I initially installed and started using this product, I would have given it five stars in a heartbeat. It worked great for about 4 or 5 months, but then the issues began. I started getting streaking toner and what looked like low toner levels (after ~400 pages). I am a tech savvy grad student, so I did all of the troubleshooting including cleaning the cartridge, shaking it, reinstalling, etc. The cartridge had most of the toner remaining in it, but I could not get it to print without issues. Nothing worked.I finally gave up and installed the second cartridge. It worked like a charm......for about 4 or 5 months. The same issues with streaking and light printing started occurring with this cartridge as well. I print about 1000 pages per year, so these two cartridges should have lasted (theoretically) 5 years. In reality, they lasted less than a year.If you do the math, the price per page is equivalent to the Brother cartridge, which is disappointing. I am about to purchase a different set of non-oem cartridges to see if they work any better. I'll leave a review on those in a year or two!",0,0

R21WT2J2VMR6J8,Bought it twice and  two times the line broke. The first time I thought maybe a bad reel. The second one didnt even last a month. The reel casing is metal instead of the usual plastic reels but the line is weak and it breaks. You just end up getting stuck with a heavy duty reel and a completely retracted line therfore rendering the reel useless. Maybe could be used paper weight but I am sure that is not the reason you are reading this review. Someone needs to revisit the design and use a different material  for the line instead of the flimsy one being used now. Only then it would be a heavy duty reel.,0,0

R8NCC413PAWLA,"There is a great deal of difference between ""Remanufactured"" and simply filling an empty cartridge with ink. I do not believe that this company knows the difference. I  bought two cartridges. I tried both of them 3.5 months later. BOTH of them had dry and crusted ink between the printhead and stuck onto the rubber sponge in the holder. It was stuck SO hard that in spite of very slow removal, the printhead ripped the rubber sponge and tore part off. I wrote an honest and sensible letter to the manufacturer and told them of my difficulties. I was met with a FIRM ""Those cartridges are only warranted for 90 days. You are over that. I'm sorry, but there is NOTHING I can do for you."" Allrighty then! So much for THIS company and the member of their ""customer satisfaction TEAM.""My experience with MANY different printers and cartridges are that on a new sealed cartridge that is as old as 4 YEARS out of date that the cartridge performs PERFECTLY. One would think that a genuine REMANUFACTURED item would work out of the sealed container at LEAST 6 months later. Not so on these worthless items. It is difficult to believe that the company would not at least offer me a replacement set after I returned these. They refused to talk about these cartridges any further than they already had. Take a peek at the one star ratings. There are almost as many 1 ratings as 5 ratings. Perhaps they have two shifts? One shift with someone that knows something about refilling or REMANUFACTURING and one that is told to ""fillerup"".  You decide. I am relating ONLY my personal experience with this company.",0,0

RHXM3860P0GV2,"I've purchased several sets of nylon brush tip markers and these are by far the worst.  Im so disappointed and I've already set up the return.

Add that to the fact that some of the markers aren't very ""juicy"", and you get markers that aren't consistently useful unless you plan to blend them with a water brush every time.My biggest complaint is the ink.  It's terrible.  I swatched every color in the box,  and while some blend well,  many do not.  I read other reviews that said you have to use specific paper with these markers...i tried both the Strathmore 90lb watercolor visual journal paper and the Strathmore Bristol Smooth surface paper.  The performance was better on the smooth surface paper  (which is not the point of watercolor markers), but even then some colors like A188 wisteria purple just wouldn't blend.

R14V03XQMDJQXA,"Ill admit to not having too much experience with fountain pens, but no pen should be this hard to write with.  The first time I received this it was completely dysfunctional.  The ink that came with the pen ran to the point of leaving a small puddle on my desk after leaving it unattended for five minutes.  My own noodlers ink however simply did not work at all.  After I got a replacement for this one thinking that it was just a one time thing I was only partially right.  While the provided ink still dripped like a water faucet my noodlers ink worked after almost thirty minutes of coaxing.  Since then I have only refilled it twice but it has never smoothly gone through a full cartridge without drying out for no plain reason.  I have a cheap little plastic fountain pen that so far works without fail and uses the ink cartridges that this pen couldn't without issue.  Based on other reviews I would say that my pen just has issues.  While it doesn't work like it should, when the ink does run nicely it is a great pen that I love to use... right up until it stops working again.",0,0

R171CZ9C136ME7,"My wife has used this cart for a year now.  We are aware of the other negative reviews that said the cart can easily tip over on any uneven surfaces and we were careful about it.  However, last week, when my wife was returning home from a grocery trip, the front wheel tripped over a small uneven part on of the sidewalk.  She fell forward and landed on top of the cart.  She severely injured herself with large bruises on both legs.  I wasn't there and she was left by herself to limp back home with a cart full of groceries.  This cart is good when you're at the supermarket with level surfaces, but it can be treacherous when you use it outside.  Any small bump on the sidewalk would stop this cart and there'd be a good chance you'll stumble or fall.  We're not going to use this anymore and I'm going to look for a better alternative.",0,0

R210WOSKDIF8JF,This planner is infuriating. Did anybody in the design team realize that they should have put  “Month Ahead At A Glance” in the front of the book and then the “Monthly Review” at the end of the month. And the same layout for the next 30 days.Some of the things the ask you to record are repetitive. There’s also no section for just random notes you may need. It needs to be simplified.I appreciate what the book says but from a design background/perspective I can’t get over the layout. I wanted this book to feel like it was MADE FOR ME. This feeling that just hits my heart and makes the book feel like my personal assistant but they honestly dropped the ball.I really wanted to like this book. I hope someone from the design team sees this and makes a 2.0 version. I would buy it then I think. Unfortunately I already started writing in it before I realized it so I can’t return it.

It turns out that this is a COMMON problem reported by many Xerox ColorQube customers.  They walk you through a process of cleaning, running cleaning page, we even replaced the maintenance kit, check the debris tray.  We have done everything!

R24E9VLZAXT02B,I wouldn't buy this again.1.  The instructions don't tell you how to dump the shavings.  (You squeeze at the right place on the shavings bucket -- that's on upper corners.  There are no markings there -- you have to know.)2.  It doesn't work on normal size round pencils.  The hole is fractionally under 8mm so the 8mm ones (common colored pencils made in metric system countries)  have to be forced in using two hands and it's all but impossible to turn the pencil while sharpening as several reviewers recommend.In theory you could use a rat-tail file to slightly enlarge the cover and inside holes.  In practice the switch that turns the thing on sticks into the inside hole so if you file down there you'll likely disable the thing.Might be okay if all you have is the (smaller)  standard hex leadpencil.,0,0

R1I08PKQ06WQ6W,"Purchased 2/7/15, date of review 3/23/15.  Wish I would have read other reviews before purchasing.  This sign is not 24X14.  It is 21X12, which is perfectly fine with me.  For the first few weeks I was happy with the overall functionality of the sign.  I like that is is oval and that the blue lights will create a movement to catch people's eye.  However, less than 2 months after purchasing the sign, it has malfunctioned.  The red lights do not stay consistently bright.  Sometimes the O and the P are dim while the E and N are bright.  Other times, the E and N are dim while the O and P are bright.  The chain that came with the light was not long enough for my situation, but I purchased a chain at a local hobby store that worked great.  Now, if the sign would just work properly, I would be happy.  Contacting the seller today to see what they are willing to do.  I will update this when I see what their response is.UPDATE 4/10/2015.  I was given a refund by Amazon for the 1st defective light, in late March.  Stupidly, I decided to give the light another chance, but from a different seller (as advised by Amazon).  The 2nd light, which was received from a different seller was received not working.  It also had 2 letters that would not light.  That seller sent me a replacement (making this my 3rd one!!!) and it was GREAT for a WEEK!!!  After just ONE WEEK,  the blue lights around the letters STOPPED WORKING!!!! I do NOT recommend this product!!! It should be BANNED FROM AMAZON!!!  Today, I had to file a complaint with Amazon due to the poor service of the company involved.  Guess I will be purchasing a sign locally for over $100.  Guess the old saying is true, ""You get what you pay for!""!!!",0,0
RRF0HLVMA6TYH,"To echo prior reviews, it is a gamble when you order these, as to how many cartridges will work for the long term.  The review should probably be 2.5 starts, since these are just okay, and we continue to order them despite problems.  I have purchased these several times through my prime account and through our office account, and have occasionally had the entire package of cartridges work, but more often one or two of the color cartridges fails / leaks / streaks or stops being recognized by the printer.  Occasionally the problem occurs right away after installation, but more often than not the problem crops up about one week into use.  LD is mostly pretty good about replacing a defective cartridge, but sometimes because we order the larger packs, we don't install the cartridges right away.  So, while the price is great (about a third of the OEM), the savings has to be balanced against the time lost to fiddling around with the cartridges and trying to clean them and get them to keep producing; the time lost dealing with replacing the cartridge(s); the time lost while the HP printer pauses and goes into cleaning mode (sometimes two or three times on a 100 page copying job); and the frustration of having the printer become useless when we have critical color print jobs.",0,0
