R3CL4QCWRXZEIX,"I only hope that this was a quality assurance rather than a deliberate change of Avery product specifications. I have used these protectors for a at least 5 years and they were perfect. Now, I can barely squeeze in a single page and it buckles up (see photos by other reviewers). My last order now goes into garbage, just as I am looking for an alternative product.",0,0
R35NRB4TB7S6J4,"I generally don't review the things I buy but it is disappointing to receive an object with all the right parts just positioned wrong. The person that is welding the parts doesn't pay attention as to how the parts should be placed, rendering the piece useless. My sculpture had the card holder placed inverted so the cards would face the inside, where people cannot see them and read them. Also the part that held the pens was placed so that the pens were resting outside of the sculpture. It would be bad to give this as a present to a professional and not realize how bad it could look to the eyes of the pts. So be aware when you receive your product.",0,0
R2N024W2JDX6B0,I'm giving a single star because I have to return them for the second time due to one of the four bins being broken. I'm extremely disappointed because the size and shape are exactly what I was looking for. I tried to contact IRIS but they haven't bothered to get back with me. I will find another product to meet my needs.,0,0
R6WWRPSUQQQ97,"I read a couple other reviews on how they have a strong smell, figured I'd give them a shot anyways. They smell is horribly strong! They were individually wrapped inside the big pack that was also sealed. Not sure why they stink, if it's the glue adhesive or what. It is VERY noticeable though. They work well, but I will not be purchasing again just because of that.",0,0
RZMYY5OAYU7RH,"When I purchased these, it was advertised as 2011, which I needed. However, when I received them, they were for 2012. They have no contact info listed and when I reviewed these the first time, it wasn't accepted. I guess they don't like negative feedback. Secondary, I haven't heard anything from them to replace .",0,0
RQROG0I8VU0CH,"I have a canon pixma TS3122, which the seller stated in product description would be compatible with this cartridge. I was excited since this would be a good deal cheaper and had great reviews from everyone. I did read another review with a printer similar to mine that said there would be an ""out of ink message"" but you could override it. My computer never sent that. The printer always read out of ink and would not receive the job. Sadly, I could not find a way to override this.",0,0

R1RMZB0I2MP2LU,"Yes this gets the job done IF you know which side to print on, but that's not the issue. I read the other reviews about the paper curling but I still had to see for myself. This paper curled out the box and I don't want any feedback about humidity because I'm in Washington, DC and it's dead of Winter. This paper curled so bad my printer couldn't recognize there was paper in there, it kept telling me to load paper and when it finally went through it got jammed in my printer!  I printed one thing and wasted 3 sheets due to the paper jam. And it's not my printer. Beware, you've been warned. Wish I listened.",0,0

R6E9Y8VWQF88E,"I've owned several Palm devices over the years, and have been a loyal customer. I was excited to buy the TX, as it has a lot of the features I look for in a handheld. When it works, it is great -- wifi, Bluetooth, great resolution, etc. It really has a lot of nice features -- the two stars I give it are for those features. Unfortunately, the sub par construction of the unit itself makes owning it more hassle than it's worth.Over the last year, the device has had to be replaced under warranty for a faulty screen twice, and it's starting to develop the same problem again. It was also replaced once for a faulty memory card slot (that was on a replacement I'd just received). Each time, the device was replaced and not repaired, so in all I've had four TX's, and each of them have had significant problems. I think that's a fair sampling of the device to know problems are persistent and significant.The faulty screen issue is well known and has been experienced by several owners (a quick tour of Palm's help forums bear this out). It becomes horribly uncalibrated and no amount of software calibration can fix it. Replacing the device with the same model does no good, because the problem will just happen again.Never have I been told by Palm why the screen issue occurs, and obviously they don't do anything but replace it with another unit which is pretty much destined to develop the same problem.I can literally see bubbles just under the outer plastic of the screen on my current unit, and parts of the bottom of the screen are faded, not to mention the battery on my recently replaced device is already draining far too quickly. I've only had this latest replacement for about four months.Now that my device is no longer under warranty and is once again faulty, I'll be switching another manufacturer. I don't want to, as I have a lot of purchased software for the Palm OS, but I don't see another alternative.",0,0
R1OQ43QUAT8N69,"This item did not work on my printer, and after installing this, I was no longer able to use my printer.  I think this messed up my printer.

R38G7868RPDKC0,"I bought this chair 3-4 years ago to use as a cellist. As a tall person, it's often very hard to find a seating setup that gives me correct posture for playing, so the wide adjustability of this chair was very useful for me, as was its lightweight portability for gigs. But the chair has two fatal flaws. The first is that the seat cannot be level with the ground because of the way the metal frame underneath is made. For me, this resulted in consistently having a sore tailbone (!) after just 2-3 hours of practicing - no doubt also related to the very thin padding on the seat itself. The other fatal flaw is that the rubber pads that are used to keep the seat in place wear out within a matter of weeks, and as they wear out, the seat slowly tilts forward even more. They're also a pain to replace. I found that the seat was so slanted that my butt would start sliding off the chair if I was wearing dress pants - not great in the middle of an orchestra concert. If not for the slant and the cruddy rubber stoppers this would be a 4 or 5 star chair, but given the price and those two flaws, I can't really recommend it.",0,0
R3864DD5Z1O0PF,"Do not do business with HP!!!  Purchased a new HP Photosmart Wireless e-ALL-IN-ONE C310 Series.  When I opened the box, the ink cartridges that were supposed to be included were not in the box.  I called HP (45-minute phone call), they said they would send the missing cartridges.  When I received the cartridges, there were only 4 cartridges, not 5.  Called HP (another 45 minute phone call), they said they would ship the 5th cartridge.  When I asked if it would be possible to ship Next Day, they said they would have to charge me.  After I explained how I have already been inconvenient, they agreed to ship Next Day.  Well, 2 business days later, I finally received the 5th cartridge.  I installed ink cartridges and error message.  Called HP, after I explained the situation for the 3rd time, the man without telling me he was going to put me on hold, placed me on hold for 23 MINUTES before he finally came back on the phone.  By then I was already on another phone trying to speak to a Supervisor.  The Supervisor told me that either the ink cartridges were damaged or the printer itself is damaged.  Told me that he is going to send me a return label for the printer and they would send me a refund check.  8 days later, no return label.  I called and spoke to a Case Manager, and they told me that they don't issue refund checks that the best they can do is replace with a REFURBISHED printer.  I called the Supervisor again, after explain my situation AGAIN, they place me on hold to for 45 minutes review my case file... never to return again.  Frustrated, I hung up.  Do not do business with HP!!!  Poor equipment, poor customer service, not worth it!",0,0

R38Y2FK6VU1U4R,"So this is a great product. I have used Palm for 10 years and agree with other glowing reviews above. Will spare you the rosy and get to the point. Palm is shipping this with TWO MAJOR software flaws:1) The Desktop Tasks app will not allow you to create tasks with no due date. It will force a due date of 12/31/2031. This a major known issue that Palm is sitting on for more than a year (I discovered this post-purchase on Palm support forum).2) The Handheld Tasks app does NOT allow you to ""Show only Due items"". This can become a big deal is you have tons of tasks set for the future, and have to scroll through all of them to find the important ones.By charging so much for this product, and  shipping with such fundamental flaws,  and not doing anything about it for over an year despite knowing about it, PALM IS INSULTING its loyal customers.If Palm support does not respond these issues actively, I will be returning my product. Afterall, Contacts and Tasks are the Bread and Butter of Palm.",0,0
RUAB3IUP6Z7M0,"There are things I like about this Ball Pen; the look, the brown colour is a little bit unconventional, its overall weight is ok and the ink itself flows smoothly but the 'grip' on this Ball Pen is the worst of any I have ever used.The end of the pen (the part I hold when writing) is polished metal and looks nice BUT is so super-polished it's like silk and my fingers slip down towards the nib when I try using it (and typically I grip tightly enough to cause a pressure bump to appear at the grip point on my middle finger fairly shortly after I start writing).If instead of being polished metal, the end of the pen had been made of the same brown lacquer utilised in the shaft of the pen then I would have had no problems as that material is comfortable to hold and gives a good grip, unfortunately, it's set too far back for my fingertips to hold in order to write normally or comfortably.In addition to this, and it's not so easy to tell from the photo, but the polished end is not simply tapered but subtly concave (it has an outwards curve from the shaft to the tip) which amplifies the awkwardness of gripping the silky smooth end of this pen when writing.Out of curiosity, I've just looked back at the many positive reviews and noticed they are mainly for either the Parker Fountain Pens or the Parker Rollerballs, (which Amazon have combined with this) and both of which have differently shaped gripping ends to this Parker Ball Pen.",0,0

R2IIQAJZNPA85Q,"This scale, with its price entry option, is an amazing thing on paper; however the implementation leaves much to be desired. First off opening the lid is truly a pain in the ass and it often takes acrobatics to get it open.

R2RYGAV3ZQI05E,"Hello.I had no intention of reviewing this item, but I kept being asked. This is one of those Amazon purchases that just will sit in the corner unused until I have the energy to give it away or bring it to the dump. Just doesn't work for me.

R2REMNVLZEPP39,"If you spend your $ solely based on the description of this printer, you are going to waste your $ 100%. First of all, my review is based on the equipments I use daily. I use 24 inch iMac from 2006 with Verizon Fios standard router. So, if one's using an Apple Extreme, the result may/may not vary. My network is always there with 2 iPhones, 1 iPad, and 2 Mac computers, and 1 Apple TV. Of course I have other wireless equipments that work flawlessly with Verizon network, however, every single time I press print from my iMac, it never delivers to the printer. I literally have to turn the printer on and off numerous times for a single page standard black and white print from this god forsaken printer. I used HP printers all my life and I have never gotten so frustrated with any other printer than this. My previous printer was an ethernet connection printer that worked faster even though the model was from 6 years ago.Dear HP, why do you have to screw up with this one? If firmware is the issue here, please fix this!!!",0,0

R1KN6JUEFN56G6,"I'm giving this 5 stars because once you get it working it works great! For such a cheap price as well. Let me give you the run down and how I set it up.First of all. It is about impossible to set up without a computer despite the manual (which isn't included in the box) saying you can set it up using the WPS button on your router and on the machine. Despite trying many times, I could not get it to work. Perhaps it is just in my situation as my multiple routers in the house were not set up properly and I had to fix them so I could use this printer properly (my own fault/laziness).Once I gave up I connected it to a computer and downloaded the program off the HP website (its a Samsung/HP printer) I connected it with USB (included in the box and I tried and failed using the wireless option) which installed the drivers (unnecessary, I'll get to that in a bit) but more importantly assigned the credentials of the wireless network of my choosing to the printer.After that I was essentially done! Anyone connected to the router that the printer was connected to could see the printer and print from it. This works regardless of whether you're on the 5ghz band or the 2.4ghz band, though the printer itself connects to the 2.4ghz, you can discover it on either. We have many devices in our home. For mobile phones it works with or without the app. On iOS or Android you can, in any app, simply choose print functionality integrated right into the operating system. For Mac computers it was just as easy, literally just open a document and select print and it will find the printer. For windows there's an extra step necessary, you simply have to go to devices and printers and add it. Then it's ready to use. I installed the drivers on two of the computers in the house and left the rest without and see no difference in print quality, speed, or functionality.Lastly, we have three routers in the house. If you want the printer to be able to print across multiple routers you're going to have to have them set up as access points. Normally one can extend their wireless signal simply by having multiple routers connected and with the same credentials. However access points are slightly different in that the routers speak to each other and you only have one router handing out IP's. It's very easy to do. Just turning off two or so options on all but the main router and connecting the ethernet via the ethernet ports and not the internet one.Edit ———————————————————Fuser died at one month.

R1BG0IMDDYAHZH,"I had high hopes for these phones (after all, I bought one for each room in my home), and as you can see from my star ratings on specific attributes, there's a lot to like about them:  attractive design, good features, intuitive functionality, and so far, no real problems on reliability.It's just using them as phones that reveals their weaknesses, and those come down to sound quality and comfort -- for me, the two most important characteristics in a telephone.I find the V-Techs unergonomic in the extreme, sort of like holding a brick against my ear (hard, flat).  And because of their iffy sound reproduction, I find myself reflexively pressing the receiver against my ear to hear the caller.  Not good for any extended period of time.I avoid that experience by using the speakerphone mode, which, according to my listeners, is quite bearable -- and no worse than hearing my voice in person.  But the big problem is the incoming signal:  I find the sound simply fades into nothingness for seconds at a time, something akin to a fading cell call.  Quite perplexing -- and annoying, since I need to ask callers to repeat themselves, repeatedly.I don't know what's up with that.  It's not the traditional problem associated with ""talking over"" someone, which with many wireless phones can result in signal canceling.  These lapses happen when I'm simply listening.  I'll probably call the company about it, but I'm guessing it's not my particular units (it happens with all the extensions, even the one with the base), but something intrinsic in the engineering.So yes, there's a lot to like with the V-Tech:  great range, decent battery life, integrated update capabilities (changing contact info on one extension, for example, shares it immediately throughout the system). But while I don't anticipate returning the phones (I'm a bit lazy and too willing sometimes to put up with stuff), I can't really recommend them.  I'm hoping that if/when I speak with the company, there will be some explanation and recourse.By the way, I do a lot of phone interviews in my line of work (writer), and for that, I have a wired headset by GN Netcom.  Now THAT is the way to talk on the phone.John Dallas BowersVillanova, PA",0,0

R2Q8E8TS1KA7NZ,"I won't comment on the print capabilities of this printer as i am not an expert in that area by any means. As far as i know its fine in that area.What i WILL comment on is the wireless aspect of it, which is completely worthless. Constant re-installs of the software, and endless issues with the wireless connections. Honestly, by the time you take into account all the time you will spend messing with the settings and doing re-installs, you would have been better off going wired. If you change modems....you can bet on spending another hour trying to get the printer back online. This printer also has a known issue when tuning the power on and off:It causes certain modems to crash, requiring you to go re-boot your modem. Very ECO-friendly to make a printer that you have to leave on....The software that comes with the printer is also useless, as common help topics can't be found in the software, and clicking help simply takes you to a HP store. The interface for the printer is nothing to be proud of either....simple tasks are hard to find, and it refuses to let you save some options as default settings ( like printing in fast draft to save ink! ) so you have to go through several steps each time you want to print a page.This printer is just trash, and would never buy one again.

R1TM4Z91FFXIF0,"I have had this printer for a year and it works fine for me  It prints, scans, and copies, just like HP said it would.  So why the low rating?  Here's why.....1. I had Best Buy Geek Squad set it up for me when I purchased this printer with a new computer.  It took him over an hour to hook up the printer and had to call for help in doing so.  So I figure if it took him that lon, there is no chance a non tech person could do it.2. The printer ink is expensive.  I also heard HP is installing microchips on their ink cartiages so you can't refill them.  I think I will go with a Kodak printer next time.3.  When I scan, it took a while to figure out how to change the format from JPEG to PDF.  HP doesn't like to make things easy.4.  When I scan to PDF, it will only let you scan one page at a time.  So if you have a multi page document, it gives you a separate document for each page.  I did find a nice free program on the Cnet web site that merges your document together.  It is by Adolix.  It works great.  But beware, there is a different program that they say is free but puts a big watermark on each page.  You can only get the watermark off if you buy the program.  There is also a free service at [...]  I have tried that and it also works great.So in summary, I would certainly not buy this printer again.",0,0

R1QF83V9C27INE,"This review reflects my experience with Amazon.  I have owned the non-lip version of this mat for about 2 years and I think its the best mat I've used.  I decided to buy this one on Amazon because I wanted to protect my floor directly under my desk from my trampling feet while gaming.  I read several reviews about how it ships rolled up and is difficult to unroll.I decided to roll the dice and order it, because I am fairly certain most of the reviewers did not go to the ES Robbins site or youtube channels that state you should lay it flat for 24+ hours before using it.  I was happy to see that my mat arrived shipped flat, however it was in giant plastic...envelope?  that had many rips and tears.  My woes started when I saw that there was an orange tape used to seal the envelope.  The tape also was on the end of the lip and rear of the mat, because the envelope was clearly not large enough to house the entire mat and seal it.  The orange tape was very difficult to rip off and left tons of orange residue on the mat.  I spent about an hour with a roll of paper towels, GooGone, and soap/water removing all of the residue.  There is still slight bits of orange coloring around a few of the anchor bars, and I can only hope that my carpet doesn't get stains from it...  I wonder what person decided that sticky tape directly on a chair mat was a good idea, especially since its going to be on carpet 24/7...Again, I want to say that my review is from my experience with Amazon.  If you want to roll the dice, hope you don't have a similar experience as I did with Amazon shipping, otherwise I can safely recommend this brand from another retailer, depending on how their shipping is, or better yet if you can buy it from a store.",0,0

R8KOG71IZXCF2,"I bought this all-in-one with Amazon fulfillment of a NextGen order.  The unit I received may have been damaged: the box had at minimum been re-shipped several times.  Whatever the case, the device I received was deeply flawed and I had to return it.MAJOR PROBLEMS:This thing screams loudly while printing.  To say that it sounds like a cat is heat is insulting to cats, but the sound was a cross between that noise and your fire alarm going off.  Even after turning all the volume settings to ""off"" the screeching continued.  Not acceptable.Print quality is fair.  Note that this is an LCD printer, not a conventional laser printer, and it shows:  black print is OK but not saturated, and color print has a distinct grain, very much like photos reproduced in newspapers.  I ultimately bought the Canon MF8580 Cdw, which does a much better job of reproducing color print and photo images.DESIGN FLAWS/CONSIDERATIONS:Like all devices in this class, the Brother is heavy.  It can be muscled into place by one person, but hold out for a large person who enjoys the gym.The Brother will print envelopes and labels only using the straight-through feed, which necessitates dropping down the printer's back panel.  This isn't difficult in itself, but it does add another half-foot or so to the depth of the printer.  So don't believe the footprint dimensions stated on Amazon, and this may be an issue if you are trying to put the device on a standard desk or cubicle work surface.THE ONE REDEEMING GRACE:Amazon Prime was great about delivering on time and picking up the return from my home address, all with no additional charges.  If you are even vaguely considering ordering the Brother MFC9340CDW, go ahead and get Prime...it will pay for itself on the shipping and (I strongly suspect) eventual return of the item.THE BOTTOM LINE:If I could have granted zero stars,  I would have.

R3GUWQFBVWRG90,"Update #4 – I have had this chair for a little over 4 years.  I’m in the process of replacing it.  I lost 100+ pounds and for the past year I weighed 190 pounds.  The 4th piston I replaced is rated at 350 lbs and is still starting to give out.  The bottom cushion is completely flat.  In all fairness, I sit in the chair 8+ hours a day 6 days per week.  The headrest, which I rarely use, has been flimsy nearly the entire time I have owned the chair.  The bonded leather is starting to peel excessively from the seat cushion creating a daily mess on my floor.  The peeling leather is the final straw which is why I am now replacing this chair.  This would be a nice chair for someone who weighs no more than 200 pounds and who does not intend to sit in it 8+ hours/day.  It’s advertised for big and tall men.  The dimensions fit well for a 300 pound person, however, the pistons do NOT support a person weighing 300 pounds even though it is supposed to hold 350 pounds.  It’s been a comfortable chair but the cost and hassle of replacing the piston regularly should be considered if you plan to use this chair for many hours on end.Update #3 - I've gone through 3 pistons in 2 years after purchasing chair.  The piston is rated at 400 lbs and I've not exceeded 290 lbs in the 2 years I've used this chair.  The manufacturer replaced 2 pistons no charge.  I'm going to try purchasing another piston from another source.  It's not worth the hassle to keep going back to the manufacturer to get a free replacement I know is going to fail.  It's a challenge to replace the pistons.  You need a mini-sledge and a large pipe wrench to get the old pistons off.  I always use white grease on the cylinder ends which fit in the base and chair end.  It helps when removing worn out pistons.  At this point I would not buy this chair again and would not recommend it for anyone over 250 lbs.  If the 3rd party piston I paid $25 for works out, I might reconsider my opinion.  Other than the piston constantly wearing out every 6 - 8 months, the chair is really comfortable and the padding holds up really well.Update #2.  I've gone through 2 pistons 8 months.  The 2 pistons I've had did not hold 290 pounds.  The rest of the chair is fine, but worthless without a reliable piston.Update #1 -  4 months after purchase.  I sit in the chair 10+ hours/day for work. Piston is horrible!  I weigh 285.  The gas piston failed horribly after 3-1/2 months.  The manufacturer sent a replacement part no-charge promptly after I contacted them.  I'll see how long this piston lasts before passing final judgement.",0,0
R3BP7XMT4DZ6YD,"Believe me, I am not especially picky. If something works, I'll work with it. I'm amused at reviews of items which express disappointment with something that never claimed to be what it wasn't. (Hand mixers that aren't stand mixers, etc.)But this piece of trash is a different matter entirely.Perhaps it works well after it is calibrated but BE ADVISED that you must calibrate it first! You need a 1000 gram item to do this. Sorry, I don't happen to have a 1000 gram item that fits on top of the tiny surface of this item. That's why I bought a scale - to weigh things.So, if you don't have a calibration weight, you are SOL.Regarding the small size of this item, normally I am a ""small is beautiful"" person, esp. for kitchen items (I have a tiny kitchen) but too small is too small, and this item is too small. You need a weight with a minimum surface area to balance bowls of flour, for example. This baby doesn't fit the bill.If all you want is a reasonably accurate kitchen scale, go elsewhere.

R1JWUDWCZMTE2V,"I bought two of these, and there were two problems.First, step 4 of the installation instructions, ""Pull seal out of cartridge"", shows (in a tiny drawing) something being pulled out of the end of the cartridge.

What good are incorrect installation instructions, I ask?Worse, the first one I installed created the gear grinding noise mentioned in other reviews here.

Not only can you talk to the person at the front door via the phone but you can see a photo and even a video of the person who comes calling.Here is the problem:As many other reviewers have mentioned, the video is very poor quality, Yes, you will be able to recognize someone you are familiar with, but that is about all.  VTECH should be ashamed of themselves for manufacturing a system with such a low quality camera.  The phone portion of the system is probably fine; it’s the video that needs to be overhauled. VTECH Please go back to the drawing board and redesign this video doorbell with a camera that is  capable of  capturing images that are of a quality  people are used to seeing in the  twenty first century.What you need to know:When I ordered this system I was WRONGLY under the impression the camera portion of the system could be powered exclusively using the wires from my existing doorbell.  That is not the case.  You do have the option of powering the camera with two AA batteries, but for best results it should be hard wired into an electrical outlet.  If you connect your existing door bell wires to the camera, the camera then becomes connected to your existing doorbell to allow the existing doorbell to chime along with the VTECH phone when someone pushes the doorbell button on the outside VTECH camera housing.Bottom Line:  IT IS REALLY SO SIMPLE, BUT VTECH GOT IT WRONG WITH THAT LOUSY CAMERA!!",0,0

R18MCVRW68SOQ2,"I used Amazon to find Black and Color cartridges for my Desk Jet 932C printer. They offered Brian's Book Bazaar  for a place ink could be purchased. I ordered 4 HP 78XL ( large Size ) cartridges. I loaded the first one last Monday ( 2/11/13) and it printed very lightly. I tried two more of the cartridges today (2/15/13) only to find both of them to be empty as well. This is a rip off, if there is no good cartridges available for my print anymore, I expected to be told so and I would have looked into buying a new printer. But to rip me off for almost $200.00 for no ink. This is wrong. I will contact my CC company and dispute the charges, and I will be calling Amazon to fill them in on my poor experance with Brain's Book Bazaar. This is not the kind of service I ever receive when dealing with Amazon.I wish to update this review since I wrote this 11 days ago:Amazon contacted both Brian's Book Bazaar, and myself about the poor / no ink I receiced with my order. After talking with Brian by emails these last few days, I'm happy to say that I have been credited back to my Amazon card the cost of the 3 bad / empty cartridges and have seen the credit posted to my card. This is great customer service by both Brian, and Amazon. This has restored my faith in good old fashion C. S. whice is to often forgotten. Thank you Brian for your trust in my complaint and your quick respontance to this matter. I will again look to this company for my ink needs.Thank youJim Russo",0,0

R2F14DU2DLMYAE,"**EDIT**After just over a year of owning this printer (2 weeks out of warranty) it appears to have stopped working properly.  It constantly reads cartridges as empty (even brand new ones), swaps colors, garbles text and images, loses network connection, prints blanks pages, reads as empty when plenty of paper is loaded locks up... the list of issues is almost endless.  I've tried every fix I know, and every one listed under HP support, and I simply can't get it to print properly.  Combined with the trouble I had with my initial purchase and setup this is simply one of the worst products I've ever bought.I've left my review below intact, but I certainly have new views on some of the praise I gave to HP.**/EDIT**There are a lot of good reviews for this product and a lot of bad reviews.  The truth seems to be somewhere in the middle.  Your individual experience will depend entirely on your circumstance.  I'm an IT admin who bought this product for my home, and I hope my review will help you decide if this device is right for you.PRINT & SCAN:++ This printer prints quickly and very well.  It has dedicated slots for photo paper, and picture quality is excellent.  The scanner is fast and also produces a high quality copy.+- The printer makes a small amount of noise, not too loud, but not whisper quiet.  I couldn't hear it outside of the room in which the printer was located, I don't believe most people would find it distracting.++ HP Software support is good and offers a wide variety of programs that work with this printer, you can use for manipulating photos, scanning and saving to your computer, etc.  I can't comment too much on this as I don't use any of their software, but I give a + for having so many options.-- The cartridges that come with this printer are, as other reviewers have stated, trial sized, and ran out for me after less than a dozen prints.  Replacements are very expensive.  This is, however, true of pretty much all modern printers.WIRELESS:++ The onscreen menu lets you set up this printer on your network without connecting it to a computer!  This was a huge plus for me, as I hate needing to 'wire' to 'wireless' printers for setup, especially if you ever need to tweak options (new password for example).  Being able to run through network setup right on the machine is excellent.+- Windows 7 requires installing software.  It would be nice if the device ""just worked,"" but you DO have to install the drivers from the included CD for this printer to work on a windows machine.  However, the process is quick and fairly painless, and the printer worked immediately after installing the software.-- Mac devices (specifically airprint) were not straight forward!  This is a key point for a lot of people, especially since one of the biggest draws of this product is that it 'works' with airprint.I'm a network admin, but I'm running as basic a network as possible at home specifically to avoid conflicts and problems.  I don't want to bring my work home with me, so to speak.  My setup, modem and wireless adapter straight from the cable company, will be the same as 90% of users out there.  Even with this basic setup, and my experience, getting OSX, an iphone, and an ipad to work with this printer required 3 hours of tech support.  see below for some comments on what ended up working)SUPPORT:-- HP chat support was horrible.  At first, with the mac connection problems, I tried using HP's online 'chat' support.  Big mistake.  The people on the other end were rude, disconnected on me several times, and basically said that HP didn't support any apple products and that I should just return the device, which is simply not true (or helpful).  When I finally connected with someone over the phone I recommended that they review whoever is running that department.++ HP phone support was excellent.  I talked with a guy who worked with me for about 3 hours trying various possible solutions for getting this printer to work, and he was extremely helpful and patient throughout the process, even when he had to wait for me to disconnect this device or reboot that device.CONCLUSION:HP is a good name, and they make a solid product.  As a fairly cheap, 'air print capable' device, this printer does alright once you get it set up.  All modern inkjet printers are expensive to run, and all the companies will give you trial ink to start out.If you're running windows 7 you're all set.  Follow the setup instructions and you've got a great, wireless printer that is good to go.If you were buying this printer for the airprint, or if you happen to use a mac, either look elsewhere or be prepared for some serious setup times.  This won't always be true!  Depending on your individual setup you might get lucky and connect immediately, as some other reviewers have.  That's great!  I warn you to be prepared, though, in case it doesn't work out, because HP hasn't gotten their mac support working 100% yet, and you should be ready just in case.This is a solid printer when its working, and I'm glad I have it, but it won't be a simple plug-and-play option for everyone.  Unless you really needed airprint you're better off with another wireless printer, and if you really need airprint you're probably better off with a more expensive airprint option.NOTES ON AIRPRINT:What eventually worked for me was a combination of setting up a static IP address for the printer, making sure that IP had the correct ports being forwarded to it on the router, and then using one of HPs online services (that came on the CD) to make a few tweaks to permissions.  This device runs its own 'webpage' that you can access from your home network, and lets you change around various options (including what devices are allowed to print, and if any are blocked).  I had to use that page to tweak a lot of the options, in addition to the static IP and port forwarding on my router, to finally get airprint to work on this device.Unfortunately I can't give a perfect rundown on what worked because of how long it took to get things going, and how many different arrangements of options we tried.  As a starting point, if you can't get airprint working, make sure you set up a static IP for you printer, check online (or call HP) to find out what ports need to be forwarded, and, if that doesn't work, call their tech support and have them walk you through the same steps they did for me.",0,0

R2M4SLS7P8O001,"My favorite stapler for many years has been the X-Acto Standup Stapler because it 1) stands up and stays put on my desk, 2) fits well in my hand, 3) is ergonomically the best stapler I have found so far, and 4) weighs less than half of the Bostitch Metal Executive Stand-Up Stapler.  But my X-Acto stapler started jamming after years of use, so based on the multiple 5 star reviews, I ordered this Bostitch stapler from Warehouse Deals.  When I received it, I initially tried to use it with Swingline staples.  It didn't work.  The instructions state to use Bostitch Standard staples so, thinking this was a case of ""operator error"", I ordered a box of those from Amazon.  Stapler STILL DOESN'T WORK, but now too much time has passed to return it.  And just where is the ""staple supply indicator"" that is advertised in the listing??  If it's that 1/16"" diameter hole at the front left side of the ""staple reservoir"" then be still my heart!

R1G1L638TOKXV9,"I have a TX that broke after 9 months, I sent it in for repair and began my nightmare dealing with Palm.  First they denied even having it, until I told them I had a Fed Ex record of it having been received and signed for by a Palm employee.  Their next effort to avoid responsibility was telling me that the repair center was moving, their customer support software is new, blah blah blah.  It has been two weeks and this is the first time they acknowledged they had the TX and where it was in the repair process.  The information on the Palm website says repairs are turned around in 5-7 business days, it will be more than three weeks before they get it back to me according to their latest estimate.

I am filing a formal complaint with the Better Business Bureau, the Federal Trade Commission, and three other non governmental agencies.  I am writing this review in the hope that I can save at least one consumer the grief of dealing with Palm, take your business elsewhere!One more interesting tidbit, the email I received from Palm contained a warning that, among other things, I may not post the contents of the email.

R2REXG144WPVH0,"We bought this printer 5 months ago reading all of the great reviews and the claim it can print an X number of pages on an ink cartridge saving us time and money.  This printer did neither!-First off, the printing quality is terrible, even out of the box.  I always got lines throught my pictures and nothing I did would make them go away.  MY 5 year old HP Printer sucked up alot of ink, but at least it gave me a good quality picture!-The 2 sided printing feature almost always never worked.-As of yesterday, my printer no longer works at all!  When I send out a test print page through my computer it will print just fine, but anything else it will print 1/3 of the way through, then take it upon itself to cancel my print jobs!

RYQW9J7A65A8W,"I bought this gadget and it was excellent at the beginning. After a year of use and conveniently after the warranty was over, the touch screen went erratic. Touch on an area and it picks a different location, touch the same area and it picks an area even further away. Draw a straight line across the screen and it scatters short broken lines allover the screen facing all directions. An attempt to calibrate takes you on an infinite loop. Contacting customer service was so annoying as they told me I dropped the product or spilled fluids on it which never happened.

R2R637LIEYS4R5,"When this file cabinet arrived, one of the interior guide rails was dislocated.

It was a fairly easy fix, which only makes me ask why they didn't do it before they shipped it.I would have considered the dislocated piece a small oversight, or maybe something that occurred during shipping, except the cabinet is also about 1/2 inch too short on one side at the bottom. Shipping didn't do that. Despite being on a flat-tile floor, it leans considerably, so it has to be propped up with a wooden splint. Fortunately I only planned to shut this in a closet anyway, so I don't have to look at it. I wasn't expecting this to be top-of-the-line, but for $200+ I do expect it to at least be square.I gave it 2 stars because it does function as a file cabinet, and it hasn't fallen apart. Yet.",0,0
R2UF2DUNRWO8Z9,"As background:  Awhile back I bought the extra sturdy extra wide Pendaflex folders - the extra wide ones have been lasting fine and are doing what they need to do, but for some filing needs the extra wide pendaflexes take up too much room.  -So I bought the regular sized Pendaflexes, which is the item I am reviewing here.  Underscore:  the regular size pendaflexes are being used for LIGHT filing.  I still have extra wide pendaflexes for bulkier filing.Re this item, the regular pendaflexes:  On the very first day of use (less than an hour of use!) one paper side of one pendaflex gave out completely by simply tearing/falling apart at (and only at) both metal hanging parts.  See photos.  You can see there is hardly any wear anywhere on the folder except the tears where the pendaflex paper meets the metal on the one side.  The other side is fine.  The metal didn’t bend or break but the pendaflex paper simply tore off the metal hanging part (on only one side).  I hardly ever write one star reviews, but I hope the quality is better on the rest of the box.  If they all are defectively weak like this then they’re useless.  My husband says I can use moving tape to repair the pendaflex since the metal isn’t broken, so hopefully not a total loss.  Sad, these used to be great.  Generic probably no worse than this!  I must be getting old:  They don’t make ‘em like they used to!",0,0

R235SV42F2V4FJ,"The other reviewers who said that the product is flimsy are correct. They are very flimsy, all 3 of them - the sides and the interior divisions, which are basically useless. Other issues:- The medium box is supposedly for bras, but who would use this to store 7 bras? It takes up too much space in my drawer for that. It's just as easy to stack the bras together without the dividers. My husband uses this one to store his ties. He rolls them up and puts them into rows. It works ok, but because the interior dividers are not sturdy it doesn't do a great job of keeping them organized.- I'm not sure what the small box is for. Socks? Underwear? The size is strange and it doesn't seem to work for anything.- The largest box - the little areas are too small. Nothing fits into them, not even ties.I would not buy this again.

R2A1NNW9X9JHTJ,Fully agree with all the negative reviews here.  The feature set this printer provides would be great if it worked but this printer has never worked reliably for me from the day I bought it (for use with a Mac).  Despite being someone who routinely sets up computer hardware and software I have finally given in after tens of hours of trying to get this to work and will not buy another consumer-grade HP device again.Particular lowlights- print cartridges constantly jamming up and in the end failing completely- printer complaining about being out of paper when it was not - eventuallly the rollers failed completely after very light use- displays on the device are completely unclear (e.g. no proper system of menus)- no good manual- no good printer management software.  most devices nowadays come with a decent piece of software that can be used to manage the device - this does not- device constantly loses wireless connectivity on a network that is otherwise reliable,0,0

R26PG2NRKD6R97,"I purchased this product to laminate my store signs and I'm sorry I wasted my money! Just as one other review stated, the paper is so difficult to peel off the back that it will utterly frustrate you to the point of messing up any quality printing you are trying to preserve. At first I thought maybe it was just the end of the roll that was sticking really bad so I rolled off pieces in 3 feet sections and tried it at least FOUR times before just counting my loss. This is JUNK,JUNK and did I mention... JUNK!! Here it is almost Christmas, I've wasted money on laminate that I can't use for anything because the backing paper won't come off, it has messed up previous printing that I had to do over (wasted laser ink & premium paper) and I still have to order a product to get my store signs done.I initially bought the product because of the Avery name and my past experience with other Avery products but this laminate is pure JUNK! They should stop selling it because you can't send it back to Amazon once you open the box and cut off the roll. So people, if you chose to buy this product anyway to save money (that's why it's so cheap) DON'T bother because you'll end up paying more in the long run! Just as I am very upset about this purchase, you will end up very unhappy as well because they have my money, I now own a box of JUNK that I don't even want to give it away to anyone based off what I just went through. Take my advice and keep looking for a better product!The other thing that pissed me off was the fact that I could not even give this review without checking at least one star when it did not deserve that!

R1KR743TP37O27,"Got this printer two years ago.  The installation was NOT easy.  It took several hours of work to get it onto a simple WPA network with high signal strength.Once it was installed, it sort of worked, most of the time, kinda sorta, unless you actually wanted good looking output in which case you were out of luck.  Colors were frequently muddy and or streaked, and periodically the black printhead would simply stop working.  This turns out to be a VERY common problem -- google around a little and you will find LOTS of people asking why this printer has stopped printing in black.  There are several ""fixes"", including washing out the printhead.  This worked for me twice before the printer finally refused to print in black.I looked for a new printer, but did not even consider any HP models (they have AWFUL ratings on Amazon in any case).  I settled on an EPSON WorkForce 3520. Have only printed a few dozen sheets so far, but the output is excellent and the installation was wonderfully easy -- choose the network, enter the password, install the driver on all our computers, print.

The image with streaks across it is default print quality, and the one that looks decent is printed at HIGHEST quality, which I presume is more ink-consuming.

R3FAK07ZAJDX8A,"I purchased this in 2010 from another site but since I make almost all my purchases from Amazon I wanted to leave a review here.You can without a doubt expect to have print head problems (as other reviewers have reported). They sent me a new head a few months after I purchased the printer free of charge because it was such a wide-spread problem. The new head has seemed to work OK since then, so I might let it go if not for the other problems.From the beginning the printer has maintained an extremely unreliable network connection. My wife pretty much expects that if she wants to print something it won't come out. Usually we need to cycle the power by unplugging the power cord and then it will print. I thought maybe it was a WiFi problem so I connected it via Ethernet and still have the same issues. (By the way, I have a Samsung monochrome laser printer connected via Ethernet and it works 100% of the time, every time. No power cycle necessary!)Even if the network printing issue could be resolved there are still more problems. The one feature I really liked was the scan to email and scan to Flickr. I really liked it until the scanner started malfunctioning and producing lots of white dots and color blotches. And then the other day I could not get the scanner to scan to email any longer, even after cycling the power.At this point my printer is a nice looking but non-functional piece of plastic. I really liked the features and the design concept, and when it prints the quality of the photos look really good. But since none of the functions work reliably or well, you should run (not walk) away and buy another printer.

R1HKYWSC3DEWUL,"Let me start out by stating that as far as speed and reliability when using ONLY there products this printer is great.  Their black ink is only $5 which is great deal for black ink.  Their color on the other hand for xl version is $60 when buying there brand.  Since this printer is a return ink program printer they don't want you buying remanufactured ink.  In fact they go on to say it could ruin your printer and that is why they discourage it.I have purchased remanufactured ink for printers of various manufactures and have never had issues until I bought one from Lexmark.  I've purchased remanufactured ink for hp, canon, Epson and dell and virtually flawless.  Now with this Lexmark my plan was to buy the genuine black for $5 and buy the color from a remanufactured ink company for 50% the cost of the genuine.  If I were going to print long lasting photographs I would always go with genuine no matter what do to the fact the generic could very well fade in time but I bought this printer primarily for uses other than printing photographs.  I have an Epson and a canon for those tasks.Suffice it to say I have been working with various remanufactured ink companies for over a year because unlike many other manufacturers Lexmark makes it virtually impossible to clone their ink.  Now I have found some companies that can do so with some success but the reason I am giving this printer two stars is because I have come to the conclusion that their practices when handling third party ink is very unethical indeed.For a cartridge to read the volume properly in their printer the remanufacturing plant must get the chip just right so it will reset the paper count internally which than tells their firmware to either fill up the ink level or to leave it at the level it was before replacing it.  What I have recently discovered after over a year of playing around is that Lexmark makes it very hard to reset the page count when using third party chips.  In fact if a third party chip is not perfect it will not reset.  I have worked with remanufactured ink companies and went through typical troubleshooting steps that help do this.  None of these worked such as reseating the ink cartridge, holding down the power for 15 seconds or unplugging from the power strip after turning off the printer for 15 minutes and replugging the printer back in.  Recently I even reset the page count with a genuine ink cartridge and than replaced it with the generic ink cartridge again but instead of keeping the condition the genuine cartridge set the volume to it reverted back to the last state the workable generic cartridge was in was by now practically empty.The reason I am giving two stars though is because when the ink level on the printer indicates very low which is shown by a red circle with a white x in it is because it will not properly distribute the ink from the cartridge in which it gives this indication despite the fact that their is plenty of that colors ink in the cartridge since the reason for the low volume reason was a failure for them to get the resetting procedure for this cartridge correct.Because they didn't Lexmark apparently starts capping off pours until it caps off the whole cartridge making it so no ink is dispersed from the cartridge it ""thinks"" is critically low even though the cartridge literally is full.This happens before the printer finally tells you that you need to change the cartridge. When I discovered this practice I was very disappointed with Lexmark.It maybe that all ink manufacturers now when showing ink levels to be critically low stop dispersing the ink properly on the piece of paper if it disperses any at all I don't know but I do know at least with the canon mx860 ink is dispersed weather generic or genuine until the cartridge actually says there is no ink to disperse but until that time even when it indicates critically low levels until it officially thinks it ran out it properly disperses the ink given that the physical ink and or pours on the inkhead are not damaged.For this reason I give this printer a one star.  I will never recommend a Lexmark again.  In fact I discovered that many of these printing companies that want you to return the ink cartridge to them after use will take out the core from the cartridge and recycle that themselves.  This is the procedure that remanufactured ink does but Lexmark tries to scare their customers into thinking that buying from these third party guys will ruin their printers and than these customers are convinced that these third party ink manufactures are to blame when things to go smoothly in regards to how it interacts with their printers when it is Lexmark who has put the printer together in such a way that it makes it very hard to clone and even when it can be read it is not always reset and when that happens when the icon shows critically low even when it is not the printer will not allow sufficient ink of that color it shows to be critically low to come out of the cartridge.Most people would not go through all these processes I have undertook in order to get to the bottom of why it has been such a headache to use generic ink cartridges with this printer.  In fact remanufactured ink companies told me Lexmark is the worst about this practice because they noticed how hp, canon and the rest were losing money because like me people would not want to pay for their high cost inks that come in pretty packages and seeing this Lexmark early on put on restrictions with their printer that highly discouraged the use of generic ink to the point where if the cartridge is not intentionally reviewed it will even give you a message that what you have is not a genuine cartridge and to please replace with a genuine and until you do the printer won't operate at all.In conclusion while other companies may soon be following Lexmark's lead in this department I blame Lexmark because it was first with them that this started happening and even when it is functional if the reset procedure failed even though the cartridge has good ink that is filled tot he top Lexmark will not make use of it but will stop it from printing that color when it decides it is critically low even though in reality it has plenty of ink to pull from and print decent pictures with that color.Lastly to polish it all off Lexmark will tell you that you have a 5 year warranty on these printers when purchased new however they will also tell you if you don't fill out some type of registration this nullifies the 5 year warranty and you are stuck with only a 90 day warranty.  From my experience I find that you can still get a replacement even if you didn't register however it is another scare tactic from Lexmark to force you to do what they want.  They control your ink and try to force you to register your product by threatening a reduced warranty if you don't.",0,0

R3IZQHYPTAMJNJ,"It is interesting that the best review are pushed to the top of the list.It's a constant battle with the ink in this printer. The cartridges dry up, they run out of ink quickly, there is always some kind of message telling me I need to buy ink. I print 5-10 pages in a week. Remember that printers are sold only to get you to purchase ink - that seems to be the case with this printer also.The wireless networking? I use a couple of Apple computers with this printer. Quite often the printer cannot be found and it takes 10 minutes of this and that to make it work. If my router loses power, for some reason the printer loses the router's password. This makes no sense at all since the printer is on a battery backup. Printing from the iPhone works most of the time.After the printer goes into sleep mode it takes a while for it to make a print.Print quality is fine.Update June of 2012 - The printer disconnects from the wireless router anytime the power flickers. Each time this happens I have to set the wireless networking up again. All of my computers store have the ability to store wireless networking information but this sorry printer does not. Oh, the printer is connected to a UPS. If the router were connected to a UPS this would not be an issue. There is no easy way of connecting my wireless router to a UPS. All of this reaffirms my theory that the goal of HP is to sell ink at very high prices. The printer may be rarely functional...just as long as they can sell you 2 milliliters of ink for $20.The printer takes 5 minutes to print one page at times.

WIRELESS SET-UP: Constantly needs to be redone(which take hours), although this could be avoided by ""changing your printers IP address"". Do you know how to do that? Didn't think so.3.

Also another problem i ran into is that this only measures grains to the next full number...which is a huge problem for reloaders. Example: i need a 3.2 grain charge.

R9Z7VVB0FOX0K,"Update: 1/2013I have now had this chair for around 13 months and I am downgrading my review to 1-star. I previously had problems with weak welds in the caster mounts causing chair to tip.  My chair has now developed a new wobble at the point where the base stem connects to the bottom of the chair. Again it looks like a weak weld gave out.  The wobble is very annoying.  This is simply poorly constructed made in china junk.  To reiterate I weigh 300 lbs and I am not doing gymnastics in the chair.  I have never had these problems with other office chairs which did not advertise being specifically designed for large and heavy people.In short, DON'T BUY THIS CHAIR!!Hope this helps someone else out.I gave this product 3 stars because the chair itself is very comfortable, but I encountered quality control issues with the base of the chair and the casters. The problem is that the welds which connect the caster receptacles to the actual base are weak and they break. The caster doesn't fall out but then the whole caster assembly can wobble inside the base. When weight is put on the chair the caster then slumps sideways. This leads to the chair tilting to whichever side the caster has slumped to. Also, any caster which is tilted tends not to roll correctly which means that a chair in this condition won't roll most of the time. This problem developed around 3-4 months after I purchased the product.(Just for the record I weigh around 295lbs. so I was not near the chair weight limit.)I solved this problem by replacing the entire base of the chair with a comparable base from the old chair I had been replacing. This was simpler than talking to customer service to get a replacement. Generally, in my opinion if I have to talk to customer service your product has already failed.Just for the record.. removing the base was extremely difficult and required serious work with a heavy hammer. (to be expected)Additionally, there is a design/quality issue with the base. The base is tubular steel and there are welds around the edges of each 'foot' where a caster assembly is attached.  These welds are very rough and when I was sitting in the chair with socks on everytime I moved my feet across the 'foot' the rough welding would tear at my socks. This is a minor usability issue, but I never had it happen with any other chair i've purchased.So make your choice.. but be warned.  I don't know whether they've fixed this issue or not.",0,0

Now to use this great Lexmark printer I have to press left back corner with some 10 lb weights - not surprise little skinny piece of plastic, stressed by tension gave way. It seems this Lexmark Pinnacle Pro 901 printer will and up, as some other Made in China electronics ed up in my house - thrown to the concrete driveway from steps in front of my house.",0,0
RM5IPU91DYP7D,"I don't normally write reviews but I'm fed up with this printer and I'm sorry I've wasted the money. Just like the other people I bought it when it had good reviews I guess back in 2012. I'm a very busy person and I don't have the time nor the patience to waste on this junky printer. There are so many problems with it, I don't even know where to begin. Print quality was decent at first and then it just went down the hill. I've replaced printhead just like the other reviewers cleaned everything and it still prints crappy. First few paragraphs get printed and ten it fades away. When I try to print PDF docs some pages don't get printed or only half the pages get printed. You'll print 2-3 pages and you'll see the ink drop significantly. If you don't print for a while they get dry. This is the worst printer I've ever had!!!!",0,0

R3UXCW9SMPC3ZC,Loved the price and read the reviews and get good about buying. I received them and used the black first. Alls been perfect until my original HP color runs out so I put the new Greenbox in and the printer won’t even recognize its in. The printer won’t print at all. I took it out and reinserted it several times. No bueno. Then I put the old HP one back in and printer recognizes it and goes through the little set up when a cartridge is first out in. After that. I take out the HP and reinsert the greenbox one and boom. Nothing again. The money I saved by purchasing this cheap bullshit is only costing me more in the long run. I should have just gone with what I know works. Now my money is gone and I still need tomoyr has ethe correct one. :::((((((,0,0

R9MZPF2G1I3TN,"Cup holder on the right means very little room for your mouse.  Because of the angle, the second you let go to type, the mouse falls to the bottom of the screen.  The mouse issue was anticipated, so they added a very very uncomfortable lip to stop it from falling off the desktop completely.  This lip hurts to the point where you need a wrist cushion.  Once you add the wrist cushion, the bottom half of the extension is used up and the mouse is now half in the drink hole.  It comes with a FitDesk mousepad which is too big to actually fit on the product it comes with.  All in all, although they obviously planned this extension from the start (because they added receiving holes for it on the desktop that comes with the FitDesk 2.0), it doesn't appear much thought was put in to this it or how it would actually be used.This review was written while working on the otherwise excellent for the money Fitdesk 2.0.",0,0

R2MW16PZZSDGF7,"I love that this desk mat came flat and it's thick! It was everything I had hoped for considering it was a bit pricier than some others that didn't have as favorable review.The only problem I have with this mat is that the edge is curled up on one side. It's not the beveled edge - the rest of the mat has the normal bevel, which I wanted for carpet.  This is just a six inch area that curls under quite a bit more than the bevel.  It makes a difference to how well its lays on the floor. I won't return it as it would be a lot to repackage, awkward to carry, and get to the shipping store which is an hour away.I'll update my review to see how things go with it laying down and the sturdiness of the mat!Update:  I've been using the mat for a few days now and that edge isn't going to lay flat.

R2XDCSKBQ9DQJB,"A two month old doorstop! The Canon Pixma MG 2525 prints photographs out of alignment with their own Canon paper, according to ""tech support"" there is nothing you can do to adjust it, AND CANON TECH KNOWS IT!Please note this review IS NOT about picture quality. It is about the misalignment of margins THAT CANNOT BE CORRECTED! There is no comment or warning about this in the pre-sale promotion of this thing...  If you want to share photos that insult the person you're giving them to, that look like you were drunk when you printed them, by all means buy this. [See photos]After a delay  of a half hour of registration, bla bla bla and the tech support blaming everything from the format of the pictures to the alignment of the stars, the dude FINALLY admitted that BADLY OUT OF ALIGNMENT margins ON PHOTOGRAPHS  is the normal NORMAL FUNCTIONING of the unit.Also, the printer won't scan and I cannot screen capture my offline PC.So, Canon knows that this Pixma MG2525 prints photos with margins out of  alignment, there is nothing the  user can do, but they still promote the unit as printing photos.This if FRAUD pure and simple.I know most people scan reviews and don't pay much attention to  a single review. Being one of those people who don't normally post negative reviews, I am  doing this  for my own purposes. As I am disabled and I cannot return this via any shipping method, my two month old Canon Pixma MG2525 just sits here taking up space until I go back to shopping and re-use the space it is in with a printer that works [NOT Canon again!]I would NEVER put this nightmare onto another person.

R1WLURE53XA5AQ,"This was an unexpected fail to me as Magliner products are usually top notch. I'll give it 2 stars because build quality was great as I've come to expect from this brand.The issue is the product design itself. There are 2 ridge humps along the middle of the entire tongue plate. These are where your cargo rests. By being both much narrower than the whole plate footprint, and rounded, my boxes kept wanting to slide off and fall off both sides of the plate. It is completely unusable to me so I removed the whole thing. I may see if I can engineer a fix to salvage the poor design by bolting on some extra edge supports. For now I'd recommend most to avoid this.",0,0

R1EHZ2UVUKOZL4,"We employ about 15 or so of these in our organization, so we have a pretty large sample size of these, all obtained from Amazon at different time periods.  Let me start with the good things about this product line:-The scanning software is very easy for end-users, even inexperienced ones.-It has ISIS driver support for the scanner, which is important for some enterprise applications.-Typically prints very well and fast.-Price is very competitive.-Drivers/Firmware is easy to find on the support section of the website, this is an important feature for IT.Now onto the bad, which is the main reason that I'm dropping this from a would-be 5 star to 2:-There is a serious defect in these machines, which is the fuser assembly.  Today I am staring down the barrel of my 5th MFC (!!!) that is basically a paperweight now due to the fact that the fuser roller has crumpled and causes a jam on every single print. Note that most of these machines were less than a year old at the time of failure, and the rest less than 2 years old.-To add insult to injury, you can't buy the fuser or service information directly from Brother, they consider this to be ""internal information"". Only authorized servicers are allowed this information.-If you don't have authorized servicers in your area, which you likely won't unless you are in a big city, you will have to sort of guess at the part # and buy it online, where it is marked up to well over half the cost of the printer.Note: This flaw occurs across the 8710 and 8910 product lines, so be wary of either one.Anyway, the TL;DR - This is a good machine, aside from the one fatal flaw it has, which unfortunately is proving to be unusually common.  Go onto Brother's service locator site and make sure you have a servicer in your area if you plan to buy one, and if you don't, you better be buying a warranty, because you will need it.",0,0

R2G1RYH426P0WP,"I thought for about 2 weeks before purchasing this chair. there are some terrible reviews on it. Decided to take the chance.With my Prime the shipping was free and it got here in 2 day's time. Well packaged, no damage- I purchased it to replace a crap ""big and tall"" chair I had previously that last less than a year.I sit in my office chair every single day, commonly for more than 8 hours a day. I am just under 7 foot tall and weigh in at around 290 pounds.Assembling the chair was not easy, the reason for the one star missing. It is HEAVY. even for a big guy like me, I am athletic and consider myself pretty strong- the bolts went in tightly, all came with blue thread lock on them. All in all, the assembly wasn't really a problem, just seemed more difficult than it should have been.All of the exposed parts are solid, welded steel and the leather stuff.The base of the chair is solid as a rock with big thick casters. after getting it put together it is very heavy, and seems to be very sturdy as well. There is no wobble to the arms or base and at it's highest level I can only touch the floor with my tip-toes.With all the reviews of one star, I can't help but think those people didn't put the chair together correctly: the screws require big person effort to get set in straight and flush, and you need to align the metal, as with any metal product- but now that it is together I don't think there will be any problem with this chair.I am going to wait a few months, then update this, but as far as my initial thoughts, I am happy with the purchase. The assembly directions were clearly labeled in good English, the parts all seem to be relatively high quality and I don't see any immediate reason for concern. If the bad reviews are putting you off buying this, I would say ignore them as I did and call it user error- because I am overall pretty happy with this chair.EDIT: Purchased on September 20, 2013, Broke on 8/3/2015 Removed 2 stars.It's now been a couple years I have had this chair and it finally broke today. Overall, it was a decent chair. as I broke it in and used it for a daily 9-5 office job it got more and more uncomfortable. Within a few months of having this product it started showing real signs of failure and started leaning badly to one side. Today it finally snapped a plastic retainer for the tilt mechanism. I will be ordering another chair from Amazon ( Not this one, would not buy again) and tossing this one in the trash. It's lasted a couple years, but definitely was not a high quality product.  After it broke, the tilt would not operate- so I just beat it with a hammer until it did. When I flipped it over I noticed it has really taken a beating. All of the metal joints and rubbing surfaces are misshaped and wearing badly. It was only a matter of time till it gave up.All said- It was a decent chair. I dealt with the minor annoyances until they became major issues and finally just ended the chair's life. Going to look for something a bit more well made with better reviews- and in my opinion you should spend a few more bucks if you are ialready in the market for a large, pretty expensively priced standard office chair.",0,0
R2CYG4UTPJXIYF,"The media could not be loaded.                      UPDATE:After receiving the response from the manufacturer regarding my original review I was gifted yet ANOTHER set of these pens from my best friend for my birthday. I wanted so badly for these ones to work beautifully, I really did, but it seems the curse has not yet been lifted. The first thing I asked her was if she got them from Amazon and she replied that she did from right here because she mentioned that the reason she chose them was due to all the raving reviews. Anyways, I tried my hardest with these pens. I LOVE to color and I especially LOVE to color with gel pens (glitter ones in particular) and I have tried pretty much every brand on Amazon and beyond so I consider myself to be knowledgeable about the things I like and do not like from my pens. Don’t get me wrong, these pens have a lot of nice things about them for sure (grips, refills, and a larger barrel to name a few) but there are some other much less expensive brands on Amazon that have those same exact qualities but do NOT have the same negatives as this brand.My main complaint with these is that they ALL skip out randomly at least 3-4 times per hour and I’ll have to stop coloring and scratch them on a spare piece of paper for a little bit (sometimes a LONG bit) until the ink begins to flow again so that I can go back to coloring. This is very annoying to me and since I have a very demanding career and three kids I 100% need my coloring time to be relaxing, not frustrating.The other issue is smoothness. Like I said I have had the best of gel pens and the worst of them and know the difference, these Colorits are definitely not the worst but they aren’t that much better either. The non-glitter or metallic ones are scratchy and rough and unpleasant and surprisingly even the glitter ones aren’t as smooth as some of the under $5 cheapies I have tried!I’m sorry but my review still remains the same even after my third attempt... my advice is still to try another popular brand on here with similar positive characteristics (like the larger barrels and grips I mentioned earlier) but none of the negatives that come with these. Plus you’ll save some money!ORIGINAL REVIEW:I have just had no luck with these pens and it really bums me out. After reading all the rave reviews and seeing their near perfect rating I was super excited to try these out! I ordered the double set with both the all glitter set and the mixed set plus refills for both. The box arrived super quickly and I excitedly ripped it open only to find packing material inside a completely empty box. After some discussion with Amazon I was reimbursed but still without these pens.I then saw them at a store here and bought them on the spot. Anxious to try them out i pulled out my coloring books as soon as I got back home and unzipped the very nice case (hence the second star) only to discover that pens were missing!Still I pushed on with a completely open mind until I touched that pen to paper and could not understand what all the reviews were about. All my pens (including glitter and metallic which are usually smooth no matter what) are horribly scratchy and have the worst habit of skipping or ceasing to flow completely no matter what I try to do to get it going again. I have sets that cost me less than ten bucks that work much better than these. Yes, color it’s packaging and casing is much nicer I will absolutely give you that but when it comes down to where it counts which is the actual part where it’s supposed to function these pens miss the mark entirely.Bottom line:Save yourself the money and grab a set with more colors that you can rely on.",0,0

R32CGF13SAI60S,"I don't understand the outstanding ratings of this printer on Lexmark's site unless they filter the poor ones out.  I finally decided to spend a little extra on a printer to solve all the problems I have had with the cheap/free ones.  I really liked the features and design of the Pro901 and what finally sold me was the inexpensive ink.  Well, it didn't turn out so well.  One of the main features that I was interested in was being able to scan to e-mail.  THIS FEATURE DOES NOT WORK WITH WEB-BASED E-MAIL.  I spent hours with technical support and despite assurances that their printer worked fine with Yahoo mail, they could never get mine to work.  Finally they sent me the Pro905 as a replacement.  I haven't bothered trying to set up that feature as now I have bigger problems.  The consistency of the print is terrible.  I have had this printer for almost a year now and have probably printed less than 200 pages with it.  Some may point out that you need to use an inkjet more often to get consistent results but this problem started right off the bat.  The issues varied from colors that would not print at all to striated print to alignment issues.  I've had to replace cartridges even when they are still full to get that color working.  So much for the cheap ink.  I've run through all of the printer troubleshooting steps.  I've also had various wireless connectivity issues.

R2MOJ90XBPL1NB,"I asked for and received this bullet journal for Christmas this year. After I got home and removed the plastic, I noticed the journal had a dent right on the front where the removable paper label had been. There was also a scuff on the bottom right corner of the book. That didn't really bother me too much, but once I started filling out my journal I noticed that no matter what type of pen I used (005 art liner, ballpoint pen, mechanical pencil), the pages ghosted like crazy. The paper is very thin and not very good quality if even a mechanical pencil (pressed very lightly!) shows through to the other side. This means I have to leave every back page blank and I'm wasting half of the paper in the journal. Pretty disappointing for a journal with such high reviews.

With the TXs hotsyncing with a MAC will work for awhile then goes to you-know-where and I spend an hour or two getting it back to work. About twice a year. The screens seem to go the fastest.

One of the plastic cap came dented; unfortunately I needed to mail something out soon so it has to do, but a bit confused as to why it was shipped this way.

R29SFKXCPICSQX,These pens are okay. They don't bleed thru paper and have minimal smudging. However the tips of the pens are fragile and can easily be bent. So if you tend to write hard then avoid these pens.  I've only use these pens for taking notes and writing so I'm not sure how they are with drawing.Re-rating these pens to 2 stars..less than a month of minimal use..the tip of my red pen is no longer sharp anymore.

R3KQUCVPEWGRUF,"Never before have I rated any product this low.  From my perspective, it is simply money wasted and a deposit in the electronic recycling bin.  Driver installation is insane and getting the scanner to work must be well beyond my capability.  For the last 7 months, I have tried to no avail.  So, I replaced it with a Canon laser which I have had good luck with in the past.

R3VOTLZMIDPK03,"We won this printer at a ""Dirty Santa"" Christmas party, so that's exciting. Free is always exciting. We've been using it for a few months now. I love that I can open a pdf or Word file on my phone, and I can print it upstairs! It's all wireless and done through my Wifi network. The printer is really quiet, and it prints at a good speed. I really like the looks of it. I have a dark wood desk, and you almost forget this black printer is there because it's really low profile. I would guess it's around 6-7"" tall. The printer never disconnects from our U-verse network, and it responds pretty quickly when a print request is sent. The ink cartridge doesn't last as long as some printers I've owned.ISSUE #1: I tried to scan a sheet of paper to email it to someone. I put the sheet on the scanner, opened the printer program, and started a scan. The scanner just kept saying ""Scanning..."" with a little rolling bar. It was taking forever, so we just left to eat at a restaurant. When I came home, the scanner still said ""Scanning..."" just like when I left, and the computer was in sleep mode. When I hit ""Cancel"", it started saying ""Canceling..."" forever, until I turned the printer off. That happened when I selected the scan as a document and a .jpeg picture. It repeated that problem whether I initiated a scan through the computer or the printer itself.ISSUE #2: I decided to contact HP to ask for help on why my scanner wasn't working. I looked around their FAQ's on their website, and the website was cumbersome with little useful information. I decided to contact HP for help. When I wrote out the issues I was having (explained in Issue #1), I went to submit the contact form. The website asked me to prove I was still under warranty with a proof of purchase or other means. I couldn't even send a contact form! Like I said earlier, it was a gift, and apparently my warranty is up after 1 year. I thought HP was a name brand, and that would mean something. I have to say HP's customer support is non-existent.Update 03/18/15:We replaced our first ink cartridge today. You install the ink cartridge, and it has to print a test page. Then you have to put the test print page on the scanner to let it scan the page for alignment purposes. Well, guess what... The scanner isn't working as I said earlier in this review, so the alignment isn't working right. This printer is truly a POS. I am downgrading this review from 2 stars to 1 star, and I'm going to swap back to my old printer. Thank goodness I kept it.",0,0

Went through usual Brother repair procedure (clean unit etc) but when I looked on the Brother site about the grinding noise, it said remove drum unit, turn it back on, and if grinding noise is gone, it's a defective drum unit, and then gave the comment it happens with some third party replacements. I have never had a problem using the cheap drum replacements until now.Also, I note that some reviewers of drum units comment that it must be defective because the need new drum unit warning or light is still on. You have to reset the unit when replacing the drum unit! Go to Brother website for easy instructions. No need to reject units as defective for that. But this one is really defective.",0,0

R34FLRO34QRNAB,"3/3/2011.  This is an update to my original review (see below).  To recap, I liked the machine in principal but it had a few severe weaknesses:  had to reboot frequently to get the computer and printer to talk to each other and it could not handle card stock.  I was managing to work with that until I started to get wide blue streaks across the pages.  Must be the print head, I thought, so ran the head cleaner utility provided by Lexmark.  After that was done I got a message that the process did not work and gave instructions how to remove the head and clean.  I did as instructed, put it back in, and since that time I only get a message that ""there is a problem with the print head"".  When I searched the web for solutions I read many reports of a similar issue with the print heads, with no one having a suitable solution.  Then I tried to find a replacement print head but they did not seem to exist. Long story short, I now have a $200 printer with unused ink cartridges and all together nothing works. You can take a chance and see if you can get one that works, but if I were you it is not worth the significant hassle.Below is my earlier reviewFirst of all, I got this printer mainly to print in black, except for the rare occasion that I want to print greeting cards in color, and to use the copier.  It seemed to be very easy to set up, and printing and copying is a real snap while it is working.  The problem that I have is that if the printer jambs, which is does frequently while printing on heavier card stock, the print spooler seems to get stuck and I get the ""printer is unable to communicate with the computer"" error message.  I am then unable to delete the item from the sprint spooler, and the only way to continue printing is to reboot the computer.  This same issue arises if the computer goes ""to sleep"" - all communications with the printer stops until a reboot.  I did not have this issue with any of the other 2 printers I have had in the past on this computer, only the Lexmark.  I did manage to print 45 greeting cards in color (with much difficulty) and the ink usage, both color and black and white, was very minimal, so the price of each color cartridge do not concern me.  Like other printers with a front load, the heavier card stock has to do a 180 turn to pass by the print head and that is where the jamb seems to occur.  If making cards is something you want to do I recommend getting a back loaded printer instead of this one.  I have not tested it at all yet with photos, however.  I have rated the installation as three stars because while the instructions were clear and the installation seemed to go easily, the problem with the necessary reboot to print so consistantly happening I just decided to blame the setup routine for not addressing this issue.  For those that this matters, I am using Vista.  The scanner works fine with multiple choices as to the output (Word, Adobe, print, etc.)",0,0

R1BR5NI6PSVUQF,"Returned it. Everything about the chair was great (nice look, matched my desk color, sturdy wood and caster wheels), but the arm holes were drilled in the wrong spot on each side. It was impossible to attach the arms to both the chair's back and the seat portion together. Had to choose one or the other--which is a fatal flaw because the stability of the back rest is mostly supported by the bolted arms. The worst part was that I noticed marks on the chair that showed I wasn't the first to encounter this problem. They sent me a chair that was already returned for the problems I listed above, which is a little insulting. Do not buy this chair as is. I've seen similar reviews mentioning the same issue. If the manufacturer can fix the issue on all of their models and guarantee a properly prepped chair, I would be interested in purchasing again. That's just not a likely scenario.",0,0
R2GMLCE5NMJDII,"Got this less than an hour ago and I'm already writing a negative review.  I just needed something to keep my lap from burning up late at night when I sit in bed doing work or surfing the internet as my rather dated laptop tends to get pretty darn hot on the bottom.  My demands were not high, nor were my expectations, so I figured a ten dollar lap desk would certainly serve my purposes.I was wrong.  I just got this and cut all the tags off (after all, like I said, it looked like it would do just fine), then sat on my bed and watched a youtube video with my daughter.  The rubber grippy feet on the laptop all made contact with the surface, no sliding, lap was protected, cool beans, right?  Youtube video ends, I put lap desk on bed with laptop on top while I go to put my daughter down for a nap.  Came back 20 minutes later to resume my position, and suddenly my computer is sliding around.  Hrmmm, that's funny, it wasn't doing that before.  Upon closer inspection, it appears that the heat has caused the plastic to buckle into an ever so subtle dome shape, so that only one or two corners of my laptop can make contact with the surface at any given time.  My computer slides all over the place while I'm typing.  This is absolutely ridiculous.  Not to mention I'm beginning to notice that ""hot plastic"" smell.As I said, I've literally had this product for under an hour and I am most definitely regretting cutting the tags off before giving it a decent run.  Otherwise, this would be going back in a heartbeat.  Don't waste your money.  This is going directly into my trashcan.",0,0

So thin in fact, that it was totally warped when I got it. My laptop WILL NOT sit flat on it because of this. The center of the lap desk is raised so the computer just wants to teeter around on it. The surface is also slippery enough that the rubber feet on the bottom of the laptop get no grip whatsoever when they do occasionally make contact. If I take my hands off of the computer, it slides right off the thing. Yes it shields the heat, and the soft bottom is comfortable, but the fact that it's warped makes it almost unusable.

R2N7SPCEBBCUFB,"I work in a small office, and our old fax machine (a Canon that had lasted us 10 plus years) finally quit working.  Needing to pick up a fax machine quickly I did some research and saw the favorable reviews of this machine on Amazon.  Fortunately a local business had it in stock, and I picked one up the next day.  The manual in the box did not have all of the information I needed about the machine, but I was able to track that down on Brother's website and get everything up and going in a short time.  Initially things worked fine.  Faxes were clear, the machine was fairly quiet, and all was well.  However before too long (about 2-3 months) we noticed that some of the pages started coming out somewhat crumpled.  But this was only occasional, and after a few days that seemed to fix itself.  But soon afterward the crumpling resumed and became more frequent.  Then what looked like clumps of black ash started coming out too, and one edge of all of the faxes was covered with black ashy ink.  The machine started giving us error messages frequently, and so we changed the drum and the toner.  That briefly made things somewhat better, but in a few days all of the same issues were back.  Finally, after trying to muddle through and while contemplating our options, the device finally just stopped working (after about six months).  There is a local Brother authorized repair shop nearby, but they did not have any loaner fax machines available (which we would have had to rent).  And they said it may be several days (depending on how much was wrong and how long it would take them to get the parts) before they would have it fixed.  The parts and labor would have been free since it is under warranty, but we get faxes every day and need to have a fully functioning machine to operate our business.  So I am instead opting to go back to Canon (I opted for the MF5950dw model), and I will never purchase a Brother machine of any type again.",0,0

The told me that the warranty does not cover returns and that it is Lexmark's policy TO NOT ISSUE REFUNDS!!!  Well, I guess I learned a $200 lesson from Lexmark.  I will NEVER buy a LEXMARK product again.  ***If you only need black and white, Brother has a wonderful laser printer that costs less than $100.  That's what I own now.",0,0
R4VJ84BLV7HQ3,It's not precise. You're going to need to re-count the coins; it's off by maybe 1-3 coins depending on the width of the coin (they're not all the same even if it's the same denomination). I made my own markings which help as it tells me when I should really start re-counting and wrapping. Just convenient to keep coins organized hence 2 stars. Otherwise 1 star.,0,0
R96N9QLNMW0T7,"I bought this printer 13 months ago so the review is informed by experience.  It performs well.  It is easier to understand how to use it than any other printer I have owned, and has a small footprint.  All functions and the software are commendable.  It doesn't jam often, and I print a lot on the backs of previously used pages.  Duplex mode is slow and less robust but bearable.  But...The original printhead failed after 1 month.  The internet liberally documents an apparent design flaw.  Fantastic customer service handled my call quickly and competently and sent a replacement (with ink!) that arrived in just a couple of days and it worked great.  Twelve months later, the replacement printhead failed.  I had a similar customer service experience.  They again quickly dealt with my call and sent another replacement printhead (again with free ink!) at no charge.  I just cannot bring myself to downgrade them when they have been such stand-up guys, even though it has taken a few hours of my time.  Let's hear it for honoring a five-year warranty.  Recommendation:  Don't hesitate to call them if you have this problem.Now for the trick:  It is only a penny a page only if you can print exclusively with black and not with a blend of expensive color inks to create gray and maybe black.  NOTE:  JUST CHOOSING ""PRINT USING BLACK INK ONLY"" IN THE PRINT DIALOG BOX IS NOT ENOUGH.  YOU NEED TO ALSO MAKE THIS SAME CHOICE IN THE PRINTER DEFAULT SETTINGS. It is possible this trick is just necessary when in the Quick Print mode that I usually use and printing in a gray instead of black to save ink and printer faster.  I am not sure about that but I do know I need to make that switch to not use color ink.  There is a vague statement in the manual about how the printer ""may"" use the color cartridges to print grays.  Watch out.May 2012 addition to the review :  After 18 months, either the firmware or software has crapped out (all is up to date, I even reinstalled the software to try to fix it).  I have to unplug and replug the printer almost every day because it loses track of itself and won't print or even turn off.  On account of this I severely downgraded my rating.",0,0
R2T0VP6GP7HUO8,"I've owned the Lexmark Pro901 printer since August, 2010.  It's had a couple of print-head changes and innumerable lock-ups, freezes, operation refusals and, in general, contrariness.  I'm pretty much ""tech savvy"" so I thought this machine would be a great successor to a series of HP printers going back years.Wrong.Well, this is not the first time I've been wrong--but buying this printer was one of my bigger electronic blunders.  It's guaranteed ""Five Years"" but I'm not giving it the benefit of that warranty.  I've had enough frustration...so it's back to HP this Saturday as the new printer arrives from Amazon.BTW, this printer is advertised as ""saving"" ink.  Oh, sure.  It uses ink at a rate far, far faster than any HP printer I've owned.In short, this printer is a miserable piece of engineering and product development.  Humm.

I figured I had a bad piece of software installed -- since most Palm software feels as if it is developed by untrained programmers.I uninstalled everything, restoring the original ROM OS.  Still terrible.I previously had an old MS Pocket PC, but the old PocketPC didn't have wireless so I purchased the Palm  TX.  Terrible mistake.[...][-- PALM OS -- OBSOLETE / SUNSET BY PALM --]Also, did you know that Palm has sunset the PalmOS.  That's right, there will be no more support for the OS on this piece of junk.  That means on new OSes (like Windows 7) the sync software probably won't run.[-- BLAZER WEB BROWSER : TERRIBLE --]So, the biggest reason I bought this piece of junk is so I could surf the web from coffee shops and book stores.  However, the web browser that comes on the thing (Blazer) is, again, one of the worst pieces of software I've ever used.  It would constantly lock up in the middle of a page.  None of the Macromedia Flash (definitely not silverlight) or special features of web sites would work.[-- HANDWRITING RECOGNITION --]Remember I came from the PocketPC which could keep up with my handwriting and recognize the characters I wrote.During the entire year that I used the Palm, the handwriting recognition continually failed.  I couldn't even write simple notes on the stupid thing.

Absolutely terrible.[--THE END : HARDWARE FAILURE--]The end of my Palm finally came when I would be typing on it and it would freeze.  I kept having to reset it.

R2FA4EKQ2J3NI4,"I bought this handheld (the Palm T|X) on July 25, 2006.  At the time of this review, that is less than 90 days.I am about to give an honest opinion and warning to anyone who wants to buy this.  I have had a miserable experience from all angles.  Usage and support from palm has been a disaster.The handheld was technically working when I got it from Amazon.  I was able to load my calendar and contacts in from Outlook.  However, the web ability is terrible and the ability to gain an IP address dynamically is very poor.  (Don't just trust my experience, search that on the web and you will find multiple issues.)  So, I had to hard code an IP every time I wanted online.However, things soon got much worse.  The palm pilot one night, just froze, and then started rebooting itself continuously.  I couldn't even turn it off.  Just reboot-reboot-reboot.  It finally wore out of batteries (overnight.)  Low battery life is another complaint, but one that pales in comparison to the others.So, I call Palm for support.  On hold for 45 minutes.  Line gets cut.  I call back and get a rep.  After giving her the serial number, line gets cut again.  To her credit, she called me back and said that they have numerous problems with their phone system.  The whole call she could barely hear me, and I had to repeat information over and over.The only advice she had was that we wipe the handheld clean, erasing all information.  While that might work, this is less than 90 days old, and is a complete piece of junk.  I wanted a refund (honestly, I know they can do it.)  They refuse to refund any money, they refuse to exchange for a new identical model.  They will only erase, and hope that it doesn't happen again, although they give no reason that it might have happened in the first place.Again, don't just take my word.  Search online for the Palm T|X rebooting infinitely.  It is a common problem.  If you buy this, make sure you back up everything everyday, and just get ready to erase and reload the handheld often.Please save yourself the $200-300 that you'd spend on this and search out another company doing a similar thing.

R2BRQKWM7D8SIM,"Very comfortable to use and light weight. Definitely keeps the heat of the laptop off your legs.

R2LZ3BQU2GJ7UR,"When I first got this device, I absolutely loved it.  It did everything I wanted it to do, and there were only a few things that bothered me at first: It froze up occasionally and the web browser (called ""Blazer,"" which is ironic considering how slow it is) will not load up most pages (more often than not it gives an error message ""This page is too large to be displayed"").  Even the freezing didn't bother me much because it usually happened when I used third-party programs that I knew to be unstable.  There was, however, something more sinister looming on the horizon (and you can skip to the end of the review if you want to know what that is immediately-- It's the section that starts with the **).There were several things about it that I noticed, including several things about it that I love, and I'll list the most important characteristics (good and bad):  --The default video program is terrible, requiring a long and tedious process of converting every single video to a Palm compatible format before it can even be transferred to the device, but I installed a program called TCPMP that does a great job playing DivX and XviD files without conversion directly from an SD card.  Quick, easy, effective.  --The music player (PocketTunes) is pretty good, though it takes some getting used to because it's so heavily playlist-based instead of library-based (there's a library, but it's effectively useless).  Of course, it doesn't play DRM-ridden files you'll find on iTunes or Walmart.com, but I would suggest avoiding such files at all cost anyway (as a side note, Amazon has DRM-free mp3s for the same price as iTunes DRM nonsense).  I found that adjusting the volume inside the program was annoying and I therefore got some headphones with an in-line volume control, but since getting those I've had pretty much no problem listening to music, and I see no need to get a separate portable mp3 player.  --Though Adobe Reader for Palm is pretty bad, a free third-party program called PalmPDF is very good (even though it can be fairly slow).  --Documents-To-Go, the included Office Suite, though limited, is absolutely fantastic, and that's pretty much one of the biggest reasons I went with Palm instead of Apple, Symbian, or Blackberry (though now DTG is available on Symbian and Blackberry).  It won't do any fancy formatting, but you're probably not going to be doing any of that when you're on-the-go anyway (at least I don't).  I use this program all the time and I love it.  More formatting can be done with a pay upgrade to a better version, but I have no personal experience with it so I don't know about the upgraded versions.  --With the version that comes with this device, though, you can edit Word Documents, Excel Spreadsheets, and Powerpoint Presentations (though presentations are viewable only in outline mode).  (.docx, .xlsx, and .pptx files are not supported out-of-the-box but require a pay update to the program, because the edition of Docs-To-Go that comes with this model was released before Office 2007.)  --You can use a file format native to DTG or you can edit .doc and .xls files directly from an SD card (not PPT files, though; those you must edit in the native DTG format, not sure why).  --The native web browser is pretty bad.  It's unbearably slow and 90% of web pages come up with an error saying ""This page is too large to be displayed,"" including Palm's own homepage.  It's not useless by any means, though.  I use it to check my email, run through Facebook, and maybe catch a news headline or two.  Once in awhile I'll even browse Amazon.  But I have to view almost all pages in the ""mobile version.""  This basically means the ""nearly useless version.""  It's the same as browsing on a cell phone that you get for free when you sign a contract.  To be fair, though, it's easier to browse on the T|X than a cell phone since you can use a touch screen, making scrolling easier, but most mobile sites are nearly useless.  Not all pages have a mobile version available, however, and in this case, assuming it actually does load, you do a looooooot of scrolling and you have to view what's normally bizarre distortions of what the page is meant to look like.  Of course, there's no flash.  It's not uncommon for me to click on a link and it'll just bring me to a completely different page... I have no clue what's causing that!  Web browsing is, in my opinion, the ONLY significant thing that Apple has over Palm, but they've got it WAY better than Palm.  --There is a free third-party program made by the same people who make the famous Opera browser for PC, Mac, and Linux, and this program is called Opera Mini.  It is, however, worse than Blazer.  Though it will load some pages that Blazer will not, it runs the pages through Opera's servers before sending them to you, making the page smaller in size so that the mobile devices can handle it.  This means that you can barely see most pictures (and it's not uncommon for pictures to just not load at all) and that most features in web pages are nonexistent.  (Take, for example, Amazon's drop lists-- On a computer you simply hold your cursor over it and a drop list comes down.  In Opera Mini, using these drop lists require reloading the entire page.)  But what's much worse than this, though, is the fact that Opera Mini is unbearably buggy.  It, more than all other programs combined, causes the T|X to abruptly restart without warning.  It freezes up constantly.  It'll take five minutes to load a simple page (no exaggeration).  It brings up an annoying message every time you boot the program asking your permission to use the WiFi.  If you turn off the screen while using the program or if the screen automatically turns off (which happens quite often during the long periods of user inactivity you spend waiting for the pages to load), then the entire program freaks out and you have to exit and restart the program.  I used Opera Mini exclusively for quite some time before finally going back to Blazer, though now I switch back-and-forth between the two.  --(As a sidenote, if browsing is that important to you, then you may want to research a fantastic mobile browser called Skyfire that is available for Windows Mobile and Symbian, but NOT Palm.  As I write this, it is currently in the beta stages and therefore it's hard to get your hands on it, but it even includes flash support.)  --I could not get the email client, VersaMail, to work correctly with my gmail.  As I mentioned before, I use the browser, Blazer, to check my email, and the reason for this is because VersaMail just doesn't want to cooperate with gmail.  --The 3.5mm (standard headphone) audio output jack is kind of annoying, but workable.  --There's a fairly good amount of first-party and third-party software (some free, some not, some from respected companies, some from guys in their moms' basements) that you can find online.  I myself frequently use a Bible program from a company called OliveTree (that also includes many classic religious eBooks), a calculator program called ""EasyCalc"" that, though not very user-friendly, would rival a TI-84+ in functionality (as a Math major, I find this very useful, and it eliminated the need to carry a calculator with me everywhere I went), and GoogleMaps (possibly the most incredible mobile application ever created, but it requires you to have an internet connection).  Of course, what I listed in this section is just aside from the other programs I list elsewhere in this review, and there's plenty more software for Palm OS.  --With a standard SD card and SD card reader/writer, you can transfer files quickly and easily from any computer (even a Linux computer).  --If you have a Word Document or Excel Spreadsheet, you can put it right on the card and start working on it on the Palm without even dealing with hotsync!  --Like I said before, you can also copy video files and view them using the third-party program TCPMP (though not with the default program).  --You can copy PDF files directly to the card and read them using the third-party PalmPDF (though not the default Adobe program).  --You can put mp3 files directly on the card and listen to them via PocketTunes (that one actually IS the default program).  --You can also add some files through hotsync (mentioned before in this section, ""hotsync"" is how you synchronize the device with the computer), but using an SD card reader/writer is much more effective (an SD reader/writer is not included with the device).  Hotsyncing files takes longer, and for some reason doesn't always work.  More importantly than that, however, is that hotsyncing will not transfer PDF files, video files, or most other files without converting them to some annoying format first (see the sections on PDF files and video files).  You can also hotsync Docs-To-Go, which seems like it would be convenient because a file that you work on on your Palm will be updated on the computer, but it's easy to accidentally modify one then modify the other before the next hotsync, so I just use the SD reader/writer to put the files directly on the card.  This can't be done with .ppt files, though (again, not sure why).  --And, of course, it's a fantastic organizer.  Task lists, Calenders, Alarms, etc.  The most important function of hotsync is to synchronize the Palm's organizer software with the Palm Desktop software on your desktop computer,**But here comes the surprising, sinister side of this device.  There is something that made this device unusable after about eight months of use.  The hardware falls apart due to something called ""digitizer drift.""  It starts out with the touchscreen not being able to calibrate properly, so you tap one place and it'll think you tapped in another.  That can be fixed with a third-party payware program called PowerDigi, but then it gets worse.  Eventually, the touchscreen develops dead spots, so that it will not detect input at all in certain places.  This is not on the side of the screen where you would rarely use it:  This mostly occurs where you write, and these spots get bigger.  Eventually entering text into the device becomes impossible, even by the on-screen keyboard alternative.  It's gotten so bad on my device that I can't even backspace to correct the incorrect text.  Instead, I'll move the stylus from right-to-left in the text input area, and it'll spit out three periods.  I'll write one thing and it'll say I wrote nothing or something completely different.  For example, this is what it said when I wrote ""The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog."" -- ""T.. ............. .........dv . .. . .....d.d.""  That is copied and pasted, and unedited.  This is not me not knowing how to input the data (it worked great when I first got it), this is hardware falling apart.  A temporary fix is to move the input area to another place, but then the dead spots just develop there, too.  Do you have any idea how much panic this induces when you discover it while frantically trying to write down something important?After some research, I find that this is a common problem among this device.  If you contact Palm support, they send you a refurbished (not new) replacement device, and as a result you lose any payware third-party software that you may have.  And the replacement device that you receive soon develops the same problem because Palm doesn't seem to care to fix it.  I've come across stories of people who have gone through four or five devices (and each time having to pay for shipping).There is an alternative to Palm's warranty, though.  You can get a replacement part, a glass digitizer ($45-$80, depending on where you get it) that fixes the problem entirely.  The problem, though, is that you either have to send it off to a professional to install it or install it yourself.  If you install it correctly, it works but you've voided your warranty.  If you install it incorrectly (which seems to be very easy to do), you ruin the device and void your warranty, in which case you have a $250 paperweight because Palm will do nothing to help you.Therefore, once this problem starts, you have the agonizing choice of playing Palm's warranty racquetball game (paying for each return by postage), shelling out money to send it to a third-party repairman, or repairing it yourself and praying you don't screw it up.  I'm facing that problem now, and reluctantly choosing to play racquetball for the time being.Hopefully you see what I mean.  I absolutely loved this device, but this digitizer drift is ludicrous.  I am personally extremely disappointed in Palm for not recalling this, and not even attempting to make amends to its customers, and continuing to produce and sell products that are known to be faulty!",0,0

R3DPZJGQRWY84K,The beauty and simplicity of making manual drip coffee--whether Melita or Hario or Kalita or Timbuktu--is that the filter container sits directly on top of the cup or carafe that the coffee drips into. Raising the filter container to an inch or more above the vessel serves no discernible purpose and accomplishes absolutely nothing--save for allowing air to circulate around the coffee drops and heat to escape from the coffee. This product gets an extra star for its apparently ingenious marketing--the fact that they actually get people to pay $40.00 for a product that's worse than worthless--and to be proud of themselves for it.,0,0

R19ODR5TAVVZUW,"Benefits:- It has a 360 rotation.- Heigh adjustable. I am able to work on my laptop on my single couch or sofa.- It has the little blockers from keeping your laptop from falling off.- The table itself doesn't look bad but all the other components are a downgrade.- The holders in order to tilt the table isn't too bad, in my oppinion.- As my laptop is 15.6 inches screen size, it fits just fine on the table with little more room for even a slightly bigger size of a laptop.Disadvantages:- Although it's a 360 rotation, I assumed the parts holding it has a great foundation to hold the laptop no matter what angle it may be (90 or 180). However, as my laptop weighs 5.95 pounds, when it's on a 90 degree angle, it will definently fall off and for a 180, it's a no brainer that it will fall. But I noticed that the closer the table is to where the wheels are facting, the sturdier the table will become. It might be my laptop's weight but i expected better. I can see improvements in this aspect.- For the heigh adjustable aspect, yes, it's good, however, it doesn't stay at the same heigh for long. The more you turn your table the more it will shrink all the way down to the pipes. I've done it a few times to back up my claim and trust me the screws to holding the height in place is tight enough.OVERALL:  The desktop isn't as great as it's described but I can see imporvements. If they make a new version of this table with improvements to the areas that needs tweaking, I can honestly say, this would be a great portable desk to purchase. But right now the portable desktop has some downsides so please consider purchasing this and keep to mind what you will be expecting. If this was helpful, please give me a helpful click as this review took me awhile lol.",0,0

RG0FZY97BQMR9,"This review is based mostly on setup for Google Cloud Print for a Chromebook.  After several hours of Google searches, false starts, and support chats, I am finally printing via Google Cloud Print from my Chromebook and from Samsung Cloud Print on my Nexus phone.I am particularly aggravated because I chose this printer (over a Brother laser printer) because of the supposed ""easy setup."" What a joke.  No real instructions, just a DVD disc that I had no way to view. (Neither of my laptops has a DVD drive.) The brief directions for connection via smartphone did not get me anywhere (repeated connection error) either.The most important thing I learned is you must have an alternate method for connecting your printer to your WiFi network.  Chromebook alone is not going to do it.  Eventually I was able to install the necessary drivers on a second laptop and connect the printer to WiFi via USB.  That was the only way I could print on the first day.Several days later I was able to print wirelessly from the second laptop.  Then I finally figured out how to set up Google Cloud Print, which was a lot more convoluted than I expected it to be.  Hint: To figure out the Printer's IP address, push and hold the ""WPS"" until stuff starts blinking slowly and it will print out the confirmation page with the IP address listed.Anyway, it seems to print fine, but the power cord is very short and you have to extend the paper tray to print, so the small footprint is deceiving.Hmm.

And then afterwards, it would pop up the errors again.This is by far not my first instance purchasing and installing non manufacturer ink, but this is definitely the worst!The only good part of this whole thing is that since it's fulfilled by Amazon I can get a full refund for this defective product.",0,0
R110S6KL7ZESLT,"Decided to try this for a two-sided presentation based on the product description that touts its rigidity and heft. Unfortunately, the paper is much less rigid than what the description denotes. Printing one side makes the paper curl dramatically (using a Canon Pixma and the settings the paper packaging recommends), and the second side smudges because of the curl.The image quality if you use the paper on one side only is quite acceptable, though the shape of the paper (no longer flat) makes it unsuitable for any kind of presentation. Their smooth matte finish is rather nice, and the product would go from one star for me to four or five if it were as robust as they claim.NB the Staples brand two-sided paper is about twice as expensive, but it is rigid enough to withstand print on both sides.",0,0

I bought this primarily because it was inexpensive and had good customer reviews.However, I run Linux Mint on my two computers, and I wanted to connect this printer to my router via an Ethernet cable.  Specs said machine was ""Linux compatible,"" so I was astonished to find that THERE IS NO ETHERNET PORT (only a USB port).I am sending this printer back because my primary computer has no free USB ports, and the printer does not seem to want to work through my USB hub.

Doesn't matter where I bought it because it the product that I have a problem with.I will tell you why I personally can't recommend this printer.1. If you are on a tight budget, look at a different printer.  Yes, the printer itself is cheap, but that is the ruse.2. This printer has constant print problems where you have to clean and realign the print heads so much it eats up all your ink.  By the time it is functioning again, you are out at least a quarter of your color ink.3. To purchase replacement ink $58.00.4. I only get 100-150 pages per set of cartridges (if I'm lucky)...

R1QUEH9DG437OI,"Like many reviewers I was happy when I first bought this in 2014. I am a small home based business and mostly print 10-20 color estimates per day. I wasn't wowed with the print quality but thought it was good enough. It's easy to use and scans well. Printing envelopes worked okay, but sometimes creases the envelope.About 6 months later the paper started coming out with imprints that looked like embossing. Online research showed there's a fuser problem. Brother support was good and swapped it out for a new printer. In 2015 the same thing happened again. This time they had me take it to a local repair shop (under warranty) and they replaced the fuser. Fast forward to 2016 and the same thing happened again but the warranty is expired.In the long haul, this Brother printer does not hold up. You may get a year out of it but be prepared to replace once the warranty is gone.Due to fuser problems I recently replaced with the HP M477fdw. Wow! What a difference. The print quality is much better. The speed and printing noise is better also. The HP starts printing immediately and the quality of prints is much more crisp and professional looking. I didn't know Brother was subpar until I saw what the HP can do!",0,0
R1ILQODHIJ3KVI,"I called the fine writing department at Parker. I told them that my pen wouldn't write. They told me that I needed to use my pen every day and to store it with the nip pointing up. That the holes in the cap expose the nib to air which dries the ink, but are there for safety reasons. That's fine. But when I pick up my Pilot fountain pen, it writes; even if it's been lying on my desk unused for a couple of days. The seller won't return my money. I was in an accident and out of commission for a while so returning this pen was not a priority during the return window. Too bad. It is such a good looking pen. Learn from my mistake. I should have believed the reviews. I am editing this review to add this: The fine writing dept. suggested soaking the nib for 24 hrs and then blowing air through it and then after reassembly, store it with the nib pointing upwards. This worked. But what a hassle! No wonder someone invented gel pens. Update #2: It has never worked even after soaking it again. My Pilot Lucina medium tip gets 5 stars.

R3SLPE7IU67LMB,"I purchased 2 of these chairs - one for myself and one for my wife. My reason for buying was simple - the chair had everything I wanted: it was rated for our weight, had a head rest, padded arm rests, seeming well padded, and a decent price.After about a month of use, the cylinder on one became stuck in the up position. So, I wrote an email to the manufacturer explaining what had gone wrong and asking for the procedure on getting it fixed. What I received back was simply an email saying that they would take care of it and asking for my address. I assumed they were just going to ship me a new cylinder. What arrived was an entire lower assembly - cylinder, bracket, screws, the works! I was pretty pleased with that - the manufacturer couldn't be 100% sure what the problem was, so they just sent everything that possibly could be the problem. Nice.That was some time ago - about a year and a half ago. At first, I loved these chairs - they were wide enough that I fit well, comfortable, moved easily on the carpet; pretty much everything I wanted. However, my satisfaction with them hasn't lasted. Both chairs have developed multiple problems. One no longer rolls well (multiple casters frozen), leans to one side and doesn't adjust up or down very easily anymore. The other wobbles and no amount of tightening of screws will fix it - it seems to be inside the bracket that attaches to the chair itself. And the padding in both has flattened out and become uncomfortable. When I first received the chairs, I could sit in them for 7 or 8 hours at a stretch without a problem. Now, after about an hour, I'm uncomfortable and achy from lack of padding.I suppose I could contact customer service again, but to fix my problems they'd have to send 2 completely new chairs, which I doubt they'd be willing to do. And, in another year, I'd be right back where I am now. So, I'm going to move on, find a different set of chairs, and hope they last better than these did.",0,0

I read the reviews. I am wondering what on earth I received that others were Ok with it. First, the packaging. It was thrown into cardboard box while in China(known by packaging) with pieces of Styrofoam. So what, you say? Styrofoam is good. Pieces of Styrofoam, as in crushed up little bits of Styrofoam with some bigger chunks haphazardly thrown in. It was on everything. It took me 2 hours to remove all of it. No inside packaging--the seller shipped it ion the same plain cardboard box from china. You have to screw feet onto it. There are some other screws, I assume to mount the reader? The manual(piece of paper) is written in really awful Chenglish(Englese?). It makes no sense. They used the word counterpoises--that isn't a thing. The plug is a knock-off white Apple plug, everything else is black. A 5lb weight weighs 4.87. Both did, I thought maybe it was the weight. All our pets weights were off by several ounces. A 3lb weight weighed 2.9, 2.87(it likes.87) and 2.93. Also wrong in kg. I thought maybe it isn't in precision mode(used for smaller weights?) All the manual says on that subject is that different models have different modes--helpful! Changing the mode changed nothing. Also, the display randomly blinks on/off when plugged in.

R163NSKEFE5N02,"I'll admit it - I was cheaping out on buying printer cartridges when I went for this item.  Yes, it was rated as cheapest in ink use.  Well.  What a load of baloney.  The darn thing is CONSTANTLY telling me I am out of one color or another of ink, even when I know darn well that they are almost brand new.  Web reviews reveal that this is a universal problem with this printer.  If you don't use it OFTEN, the ink-sprayer seems to dry up or clog up, giving the message to the printer that it is low or empty of ink.  I can't tell you the number of times I have almost tossed this piece of crap out the window.Every freakin' time I try to use it (after a week or two of lying dormant), it gives me trouble.  Also, it tends for some reason to loose contact with the computer, requiring a re-boot (which takes forever).  Yes, it was cheap.  I guess got I what I paid for.  But all I wanted was an inexpensive printer that would work when I needed it to, and not give me any headaches.  This is NOT IT!UPDATE MARCH 2015: I finally got rid of this annoying piece of ... stuff!  After threatening and complaining for years, the thing finally got a error that I just could not clear.  I AM SO HAPPY!  As a sane and thrifty person, I was reluctant to get rid of a piece of hardware that was still 'working', if you can call what this printer did 'working' at all.  I really wanted to take it out to the driveway and destroy it with a sledgehammer for all the grief it's given me, but because I am a delicate little old lady (AND for the fact that my husband would not let me near the sledgehammer) I instead just had him take it somewhere that recycles computer equipment.

Even the manufacturer neoLAB told me there is an issue with the unit via email but they will not help me and they will try to address the issue in the future. HOW DOES THAT HELP ME KNOW?

Unfortunately, I'm kicking myself for that now as I am about to go to Walmart and purchase ink and will be spending twice what I would have had I just bought the one color I needed. Perhaps quality assurance is something this company should be spending more time on. Do they test the cartridges before selling them to make sure they work properly? If not they should be.

R1DNLMZQRNFKAV,The quality control on this pen set is terrible. One of the pens came broken. It had little shards missing from it but they were not in the case or packaging at all and the packaging was not damaged either. In fact the box was shrink wrapped and the set did not look used.The packaging looked nice and expensive and the case looked nice at first glance also. There were no loose strings and the stitching looked nice. However almost every pen was stained black on the side that rested against the case. I can just imagine someone putting the case in an expensive purse or bag and the case's black rubbing off.The pens themselves are skinny and cheap feeling. The grips are hard plastic. My first set of gel pens was a Walmart cheap set that was better built than this set. At least the WM set have a rubber/gel grip and feel more substantial. I did not want to use any of the pens knowing I was returning them so I don't know how they preform.I had little doubt I would like these pens with 4.8 out of 5 stars and over 800 people reviewing them.

Every time I printed something there were streaks on the paper. I had to print several copies before one could be used. Initially I thought it was the kids messing with the printer  because they are doing online learning. We used so much ink and paper so quickly. I mistakenly ordered another set of this ink. Well same thing happened. I didn’t even use it all. I replaced all my cartridges with HP and suddenly everything was printing fine again. I’m sadden to say this did not work for me.

R3R5MDITF7M4DA,"I am 6'5"" and 190 lbs--so tall and lanky, tending on the lean muscular side.  I was really hoping that this chair would work for me based on other reviews.  In general, everything is good--it seems a solid chair, surface quality is good, lean is effective...but there is one infuriating quality that is causing me severe back problems:  they seem to have sewn in some added extra padding on the upper shoulder area as a design feature of this chair.  This extra padding juts out and really catches the edges of my shoulder blades, causing my upper back to lurch forward just a bit, while my head then rests backward again to meet the headrest.  It feels comfortable for about 30 minutes, but very quickly starts to reveal very unusual and uncomfortable strain on the muscles in the shoulders and upper back.It's reached the point where I'm really considering removing the stitching to pull out the extra upper back padding to see if everything is perfect without it.  I imagine it's the kind of thing that would be useful if I weighed 350 lbs, but is just really awkward and non-ergonomic when I just need some straight-backed support.  I hoped I would get used to it or break in the chair a bit more so that it wasn't so bothersome, but it has only gotten worse over time, so much so that I've just gone back to my old office chair that was not at all big & tall.Update 12/19/16:  After about six months of use, the headrest broke.  I'm not sure how.  But the metal pole on one of the sides disconnected from its internal support in the headrest and now leans awkwardly backwards on one side.  It isn't of much use now.  I'm seeing if the manufacturer will replace the headrest.",0,0
R1YQDPKBQ1TIHT,"3 words: it is dim. It works but it's probably 1/4 brightness of the original lamp.  1/2 brightness of another after-market replacement (from ebay) I used in my Viewsonic Pro8200 projector after the original blew.  I use it in a pitch-black basement room, and the projected movies still look dim.  Worst of all, when I try to adjust brightness, it changes how bright grays and blacks but only relatively -- it doesn't seem to increase absolute brightness of the projected image.  In short, I am disappointed with this replacement lamp.  I bought it from Exclusive Bulbs in Dec 2016.UPDATE: Turns out the first lamp I received may have been defective.  The replacement is plenty bright.  Exclusive Bulbs reached out to me after I posted my review and assured me that my satisfaction was their priority.  They sent me a shipping label to return the lamp to them, and the replacement they sent, a couple of days after I had sent mine back, is very bright.  I am still unable to adjust the brightness of this lamp to my satisfaction (brightness control just changes the relative grayness - almost like another contrast adjustment), but it is extremely bright, so it's OK.  In truth, it could be my projector at fault, not the lamp. I can't be sure. With my previous 2 lamps brightness could be easily adjusted, and hence I assumed it must be the lamp. In all, I am satisfied with the replacement lamp, and I am upgrading my review to 4 stars.UPDATE2: The replacement lamp didn't last very long.  A few months (probably a 1/3 of the time it was supposed to last).  The same was true for the other replacement lamp I received.  Maybe I just got 3 defective units (too dim x1, and lifetime too short x2).  Changing my review to 2 stars.",0,0

RQ77X163IKD0S,"One of the worst setup experiences of all the printers I've owned.  First of all, the ""quick setup"" sheet gives you inaccurate and criminally vague information.  The setup failed no less than two dozen times (I was getting close to 30 times--I kept count) using various methods - with USB, without USB, restarted wireless router multiple times (mind you, all other devices I disconnected from wifi before setup in case it would make a difference.  it did not).  The documentation is horrible.  See my photos--the problem was that the setup couldn't find the wireless printer.  Troubleshooting went only so far as anyone with common sense would guess--Check that the wireless setting is active on the printer.  Try restarting your wireless network.  Check to make sure the USB is connected if you're configuring wireless using the usb cable.  If all 3 of these fail--which they did, over two dozen times.  You're outta luck.

In the drawer or not, I didn't want to risk rough metal edges. Also, I am not sure how sturdy the plastic pieces would be that were holding it together.

Putting it together wasn't difficult, but some of the screws didn't align with the holes.  It took some tweaks and ultimately it worked out.First thing, I liked the look of it.  It is heavy and again seemed heavy duty.  Now I bought this to replace my Staples econo-chair and researched looking for a chair for my size.  I am 6'4"" and dangerously close to 300 lbs.  When I first sat down, it was really stiff.  The back hit me in a very weird angle and it wasn't comfortable.  I figured I would let it break in.  That said; the bottom of the chair didn't come out any further than my econo Staples chair.  So what happens is that the cushion ends in a way that is uncomfortable for my legs after long periods.I still would have gave it 4 stars up to this point.  But now, not having it even 3 months and the thing squeaks everytime I move in it.  Loudly!  In addition to that, it has broke in and the results are worse not better.  The bottom cushion feels like a board after about an hour of sitting.  My back hurts more with this than any other chair I have used.So if you are a larger human being and want a comfortable chair to sit in for significant periods of time, I cannot recommend this chair for you.  If you are smaller than me and only use it for an hour at a time, then this should work fine, but there are cheaper alternatives that can do that.",0,0
R1WJV87IWEJO61,"After unpacking, I quickly discovered that the plastic frame -- which is also a hanger bracket -- arrived cracked and broken in the top left corner, which is also the mounting point. It is truly absurd that a mail-order company (the item was shipped in a factory original packaging) is unable to design a box that would adequately protect this fragile item in harsh shipping environment. Here's the problem: there is absolutely no cushioning material (other than the thin cardboard of the box) to protect the board from sliding along the longer edge. Once the item is placed on a hard surface (e.g. my brick porch), even with some moderate impact, it will crack like an egg shell. I do not blame Fedex. They cannot baby every single package they handle. These guys move fast. It is naive of this manufacturer to hope that placing stickers or tape with a label ""fragile"", will do the trick for any delivery guy/gal.Universal(R), fix the packaging!It would cost you say 50 cent to add some cushioning material around all 4 edges to properly immobilize and cushion the board inside the box to protect it from moving around and impacting hard surface. And then you wouldn't have to deal with cost of restocking, returns, fixing and waste! Not to mention bad feedback, disappointed customers, and Amazon having second thoughts if they should deal with the company. It just makes no business sense whatsoever.I'm giving the product 2 stars and not 1, because the board itself is quite nice -- for the price. The surface (in my case) was smooth with no dents. The mounting instructions seemed clear and simple. So, I think (but couldn't say for sure...) that I probably would have been quite happy with the board... if only I had a chance to mount it and use it.And kudos to Amazon for making returns painless. Print out the authorization barcode. Put it into the box. Seal the box and wait for the UPS driver to pick it up tomorrow. No cost on my part. No hassle. Thank you Amazon -- that is exactly why I remain a loyal Prime member.Would I recommend this board? I've seen other reviews of customers complaining along the same lines as I just did... And based on the box I have just witnessed and evaluated myself (I'm an engineer), I estimate your chances at around 50/50: You might get a board which is intact. Or you might get a board which is damaged in shipping... It's a lottery.Shame on the manufacturer for not designing properly protective box. What a waste and inefficiency.",0,0

I bought these mainly for large graphic technical drawing prints on my fairly big WF-7720, where I don't mind colors being slightly off or weak.  I was right.  I had hoped it would work for photos for a small photo job.  No!  Ugly prints.  I found a complete OEM set at a club store, and same photos printed perfectly.

R2FPY2L1S2XDO2,"MY POOR RATING HERE IS NOT FOR HP INK CARTRIDGES, BUT RATHER FOR MY PURCHASE OF THE HP78XL CARTRIDGE THROUGH ASHBY STORE AND FULFILLED BY AMAZON.I am one of Amazon's biggest fans... I believe they generally have the best prices and service around.  As a result, I buy just about everything I possibly can through Amazon.com.  However, this was definitely the WORST purchase I have ever had through Amazon!This seller, Ashby Store, is quite clearly one of the very worst.  The Hewlett Packard HP78XL tri-color ink cartridge I bought from them, fulfilled by Amazon, was absolute JUNK!  To begin with, the Amazon packaging box was in perfect condition, but the HP box was very beat up and looked old.  On top of that, the HP box was clearly intended to be sold only in a Spanish-speaking country, as it was primarily in Spanish, listed HP as the ""Exportador"" and listed three different Argentinian, Brazilian, and Mexican companies for which it was ""Importado"".The area of the HP box that states the Warranty End Date had that end date carefully and suspiciously covered by a professional-looking sticker identifying the cartridge and stating it was new.  The HP box, which looked as though it might have been previously opened and then resealed, contained the usual inner white thin cardboard enclosure that holds the cartridge, and that white enclosure also looked as though it might have been previously opened. Once I took the cartridge completely out of all packaging, the sticker that usually covers the inkjet outlets had ink that had leaked onto it.  Further, the warranty end date printed on the cartridge itself was ""20130311"", which translates to March 11, 2013 and means the cartridge I received on 01/29/2014 was more than ten months beyond its warranty expiration date while still being sold at a $60 retail price.Just to be sure of my suspicions, I went ahead and installed the cartridge in my printer and then attempted to do the usual printer alignment.  The page that was ""printed"" barely had a mark on it, and the printer was telling me to try to do another alignment page.  Instead I tried the printer's ""clean cartridge"" maintenance function, but again got very poor results with only about 5-10% of the usual coverage.  That was enough for me.I was desperate to replace the old, empty HP78XL cartridge that was in my printer, so I got a Staples coupon for 15% off and paid $56.94 for it, even less than what I paid through Amazon.  After installing that new HP78XL cartridge from Staples, my printer worked perfectly.The only positive THING I can relate about this experience was Amazon's excellent customer service.  I called them and was immediately issued a refund along with having them set up a free pickup of the WORTHLESS junk cartridge by UPS.IF I COULD RATE ""ASHBY STORE"" AND THIS PURCHASE WITH FIVE NEGATIVE STARS, I WOULD DO SO, BUT THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE.

R3ISZPRNHNQZMC,"I usually don't write product reviews, but in this case my experience has been so awful that I just have to try to keep people from buying this product.First off let me say that I didn't pay a dime for this printer, it came for free with my MacBook Pro.  Seemed like a good deal, the wireless feature sounded great, and our other printer was getting outdated.  Got it home, set it up, printed from my Windows desktop and it worked great.  Tried to set it up on my new MacBook, which the printer came with mind you, and there were no drivers for OSX Lion.  None.  HP even acknowledged that they didn't support Lion at the time.  Why would a printer be bundled with a computer that won't support it?  Also, when HP finally released drivers for Lion, the download was over 500 mb.  500 mb for printer drivers?  Not to mention it STILL doesn't work in Lion, whether wireless or wired.So now we've resorted to printing everything from one of our Windows machines, which is still hit or miss.  The wireless function doesn't work at all, even though the printer is online and I can ping it.  Now, even when plugging in to USB the printer is unresponsive when a print job is sent to it.  I've tried all manners of resetting the printer, uninstalling and reinstalling drivers, turning off energy-saver mode, etc; nothing.  Every now and then it will randomly print a document on the first try, but for the most part it just sits unresponsive.Not to mention some of the other problems like the fact that printed pages get shot across the desk onto the floor, it uses ink very fast, and it spends more time running the motors and cartridge than actually printing.To sum it up, I absolutely despise this printer.  I would rather go back to my old dot-matrix printer than use this.  Even if you can get this for free as a promotion I wouldn't recommend it, pay the extra money for a better printer (probably from Epson or Canon).To HP: If you have a representative reading reviews on here, I really hope your next line of printers is more reliable than this.***UPDATE 1/4/2012***In this review I failed to address the issue of ink usage.  The initial cartridges were used quickly, which is typical with shipped cartridges.  As a replacement we purchased the standard HP 564 Black cartridge, installation was easy, but we printed about 60 pages of text on ""fast draft"" and the black cartridge was empty (note the cartridge packaging lists it is good for 250 pages).  After this we tried out the 564XL cartridge, and after printing about 80 pages of text on ""fast draft"" it is also out of ink.  The ""XL"" states that it is capable of 3x the pages of the regular, so 750 pages.  750 pages of what, 1 word on each page?  I actually had a situation where I had to dig out my old printer and use it to print one page since the B210 wasn't capable.

R3ROVGGS8FPX1Z,"I should have listened to the other reviewers!

Unfortunately this is the only 48x36 magnetic whiteboard that amazon has for a reasonable price so I'll have to look elsewhere for a better one.",1,1
R25EJKOULAIQWQ,"I returned for these 3 reasons:1 - Poor design.  The mounting plate has a screw in it which is secured by a bolt (see picture).  The door stop post with the magnet screws onto that screw after the plate is fastened to the wall.  If that bolt loosens, then it will spin and there is no way to remove the post from the plate so you would have to rip out the screws to get the entire assembly off, and then of course you now have a major wall repair to make.  I would suggest getting some paint on bolt lock if you plan to use it.2 - Poor Quality.  The post does not screw on fully to cover the mounting plate.  The threads don't go deep enough and it bottoms out.  So the post will be a little away from the wall and you can see the mounting plate in the crack (see pictures).  They need to run the threads a little deeper or cut the screw off a little shorter.  I was planning to cut one thread off the screw but the next issue below made me decide to send it back.3 - Poor Quality.  The screw is crooked on the mounting plate (not square).  So if you could screw the post on all the way, it would be touching the wall on one edge, and there would be a gap on the other edge (see pictures).  The plate is pretty thick so I was unable to bend the plate to make it square.So, overall, they need to make another step in the manufacturing to make sure it is fit to be installed.  I bought 6 and only one was fit to install.  I over-tightened the screw into the post on several to try to run the threads deeper and got pretty close but it did flatten the threads on the end of the screw ... definitely not how it was designed.Another note - the pictures of the packaging are not accurate.  They are NOT made by Stanley which is what the pictures say.  They are made by National Hardware.  The packaging is identical other than there is no Stanley on the label, so that leads me to believe this product was bought from from Stanley by National Hardware, and the packaging changed, and perhaps QC was reduced or changed?  This is speculation but perhaps all the good reviews were on the Stanley version?Bottom line is I would keep looking for a better quality version of these.",0,0

R33DAJO1VF3XJC,"I really like this printer, but if you're not technologically inclined, you may want to move on. There is almost no documentation with this printer, and what little there is, is poor. I connected directly to my network via the ethernet port, and installed the software on my computers and my phones. I don't know how it would do wirelessly, but I suspect it will take some effort. Using the app on the phones, it detected and connected easily. It's things like duplexing, scanning, and other features that are very poorly documented. As for the printer itself, it's a great printer, copier and scanner. It's quick, and the quality is good.UPDATE: I can't recommend this printer. There's no easy way to print envelopes. You have to take the paper out of the normal feeder and adjust the guides, and most of the time you will have to try 2-3 envelopes because of misfeeds. I am so sorry I bought this printer, but it's too late to return it. 7/25/21.UPDATE 2: There is no after market toner cartridge for this printer, so you will have to buy the expensive cartridge from Pantum.

The lid did indeed seemingly  stay closed and latched with the key in the lock - except that the key would wiggle loose and the lid open and spill the contents.(3)  Hmmm... but then, the first time we used it with a members' group, the handle came off whilst carrying it across the room, and it spilled the contents over the floor.

R26XOJABXA4QHS,"Purchased these labels (#41567 1 1/2"" x 1 1/2"" Square Kraft Labels) and regret every minute of it. Although they look nice, I couldn't get the Avery template to work with them. Tried as I may, I couldn't get the template to line up with the labels when printing. I have never had this happen with other Avery label products, but these are a nightmare. As others have stated, they come in a 4 x 6 sized sheet and had they been in a traditional 8 x 11 sheet, maybe that would be better. Paying $12 for 60 labels is steep, but if the company template works with their product, not a problem. If you waste half of them trying to print the product with the company's template, it's a rip off. I gave up trying after 3 sheets were wasted. Sadly, I couldn't use them with my project. Be aware that this could happen to you.Oh, and I find it interesting that all the positive 5 star comments are from people who were given the product for FREE. I paid through the nose for mine, and think there is room for major improvement. I found kraft labels on an 8 x 11 sheet (24 labels/sheet) for mere pennies compared to these at OnlineLabels.com. You can order labels by the sheet if you wish, and I got 240 labels for UNDER the Avery price here.

R8NPUMO9INF1Z,"Only actually used this printer, purchased in June/July, very little so far (late November) due to frustrating set-up problems with my tablet. Finally got totally fed up and went the desktop pc connection route - took me maybe 5 minutes to do that! It seems to work really well, a few seconds delay before starting to print but then spits out a page fast. Not as dark as I want and haven't found the setting in the clunky menu to make it darker. Also the page comes out with a noticeable curl from feeding through the printing process. For usage I might be inclined to give it 4 stars (menu has too much room for improvement, page curl) but the frustration with not being successful connecting it to my tablet, which I use far more than my desktop pc now, far outweighs how well it works. When trying to print from my tablet, the app on my tablet says connected, I click to print a doc, the printer screen lights up and says Printing... but nothing happens and the printer goes back to sleep. I did not try any form of customer service for help, after reading other reviews about non-English speaking customer service - thought that might add to my frustration level rather than help it. I'd like to see the company hire a true US-English speaking employee to put the instructions into real usable English - they are clearly written by somebody who knows enough of the language to string a bunch of words together, but not enough to actually explain the steps necessary. Or else the instructions are just plain faulty and need to be updated, which is also a possibility. Summary, when it's working I actually love? it!, but the high frustration and lack of success using it with my tablet far outweighs even the functioning, when forced to turn on my pc if I want to print something.",0,0

R14B5YGBQ2GM0J,"As you can see in my picture, the Moleskin pen sends pen strokes to the app to display on the screen.  It just doesn't do it consistently, reliably, or accurately.1)  You MUST have the app open to receive the pen strokes2)  DO NOT attempt to write if the pen is transmitting previous pen strokes to the app.  The transmission rate is ridiculously slow.  My 1st grader can write faster than this app.3)  If you were writing away from the open app and have saved pen strokes in the pen, DO NOT attempt to sync and write new content at the same time.  In my picture you can see that the sync failed as I was writing, all pen strokes were lost (that is really stupid...  no fail-over to ensure accurate transmission before deleting the pen strokes form the pen memory?).  There is supposed to be a full page of writing I did last night above the sentence you see.4)  You must write properly for this to work reliably.  The pen does not work well with cursive.  See my second pic of an earlier page where I was less disciplined in my pen strokes.

The printer/software showed I had plenty of ink, but I needed this now so I put in brand new cartridges (Lexmark cartridges).  NOTHING!  I changed every option I could in printouts, but just wasted more paper.  I tried to get help on Lexmark site (since manual mentioned nothing about problems with color not printing).  But when I got to the area that asked what product I am writing about, their site would not recognize ""Pinnacle"", ""Pro"", ""901"", etc., etc. - just kept saying ""product not found and no drop-down list to choose from).This beats Hewlett-Packard with problems.  Too many to list, but most annoying is TOUCH SCREEN on printer BLANKS OUT after couple months use..have to turn off and on several times to get back.DUPLEXING OPTION does NOT WORK for legal paper.  So if you want to print your Calendars on a program like CCWIN (or any other legal that needs duplexing), IF YOU CHECK ""DUPLEX-MANUAL"", then print, it prints ALL PAGES WITHOUT duplexing.  However, once you've wasted those pages, if you do nothing else but print SAME document again, it correctly does MANUAL duplexing so you can put pages back in to print on reverse side.More miscellaneous problems so I checked their ""HELP"" - couldn't believe that one of their two options said ""Ask a friend""!

R21MQG4JVM6KPC,"After a horrible experience with a brand new HP Officeject Pro 8500, and a less than helpful customer service rep, I boxed the HP and returned it to the store.  I spent a couple of days researching other options for my home office.  I was really looking for a wireless printing option that is customizable through ""apps"" that can be downloaded to the printer.  I ran across The Lexmark Pinnacle Pro 901 at a brick-and-mortar store.  I read some really good online reviews of it and decided to give it a try and ordered it through Amazon at about $50 off the brick-and-mortar store.Compared to the HP, this printer is a JOY to use.  Set up was easy as pie and it works exactly as advertised.  I was up and running with my printer connected to my wireless network within about 20 minutes.The ""apps"" (which Lexmark calls SmartSolutions) have a ways to go.  They are mostly just smart buttons which are programmable to perform repetitive tasks (for example, scanning a document and emailing it).  I am hopeful that more companies will create apps for Lexmark which allow printing of boarding passes, maps, directions, restaurant menus, etc. directly from the printer.For now, I am so happy with this all-in-one printer.  It has de-cluttered my home office (I previously had a printer, scanner, and fax machine scattered about).UPDATE: I previously gave this printer 4-stars, but have changed it to 1 star after a few months of use.  The printer freezes up frequently, requiring a restart to bring it back to life.  Also, I have been through three print heads for this printer.  It will just stop printing black ink.

Mine showed screwy weights when weighing the same object - .01 oz; 0, 3 oz. You get the idea.2) Really poor user experience:  a) The manual is in 4 point type and isn't even accurate. For example, it refers to an 'on/off switch'. There is a switch that turns the scale on and off but it isn't labeled on/off.  b) Their website is not much help. No tutorials or even manuals there. Their FAQs contain useless info, such as definitions of 'Weighing Scale' and  'Accuracy'. Really.  c) The manual instructs you to calibrate the scale by using their 1 KG weight, which is not included.My scale may have worked if I calibrated it.

R2NHULX08ABWN,"The bins, which are okay in construction though a little fragile, arrived with a broken lid. I thought it would be simple enough to ask them to send another lid. No. I send an email to their support as listed by Amazon. They don't respond. I send a follow-up 5 days later (because you never know with email!), and I actually thought they just weren't going to respond. However they did respond (5 additional days later), only to pass the buck and say that it's someone else's problem and that I should return these large bins to do the entire process again. So broken item (due to fragility), slow support email, bad support (non-)solution. Awful. Here is the email, with the greeting/signature excluded:> Unfortunately, we do not offer the lids separate from the containers.> We manufacture them as a whole unit when they are produced.>> Per our contracts with them they receive an allowance to cover instances such as this.> We cannot issue replacements for them. We do not have access to their orders to assist with them.> Usually what they require you do is return and reorder.EDIT: Added a star because I am indeed using three bins and lids.",0,0
R3A3GWW1QGRXXT,"Because this product failed, I have been forced to drastically change a previously positive review.I bought this chair less than four months ago to replace a CPRO 600 that was about ten years old. First, the CPRO 800 does not adjust as low as the CPRO 600. This difference is a drawback for anyone who has to get low and use a polar scope on an EQ mount or for viewing sky objects near the zenith. Second, this product failed to support my 240 pounds after only a few months usage (i.e. used less than 20 or thirty nights). The most disappointing part of this particular purchase is that my chair appears that it might have been previously repaired and I bought it as a new product. If it wasn't a repaired item, it most definitely appears to be some sort of second, and for this I hold the vendor responsible. Frankly, at this point, I honestly don't know whether the seat's support arms were bent when I bought the item new, or if they bent because the product failed. Look at the three pictures of the underside of the seat that I have attached. I swear this product looks like it broke or failed previously and someone re-attached the seat to the frame. I did not misuse or abuse this item and it did not perform as advertised. If I could give this zero stars, I would. I want my money back when I return this product. By the way, I'm going back to the CPRO 600.",0,0

RNPLZECK74H0C,Like others I found that the tabs don't stick to themselves when folding them over.  I used a little gorilla glue to make them stick. Printing was pretty easy.  You need to know how your printer prints before you stick one of these in the tray.  I suggest putting a mark on plain paper and doing a test print before.  This will give you orientation before wasting a sheet of tabs.I would have given them at least 4 stars but very frustrating when you have to re-glue every tab.,0,0

R1MHY81VZ32P16,"I bought one of these a year ago to replace my eight year old HP officejet. I was interested in the low cost of the ink cartridges, the smaller size of the printer and the print quality.  I was debating between the Pinnacle Pro 901 and a similar HP and I decided to try a new brand.I was wrong, and that decision has been a painful one. The Lexmark Pinnacle Pro901 has turned out to be one of the WORST printers I could have bought. It never seems to want to ""wake up"" when I need to print something.  The print cartridges run out very quickly - even if you get the XL sizes.  And finally, doing anything simple is a chore with this machine - it is always waiting or requesting something. I've done everything from update the firmware to replace the printhead (at Lexmark's request) and it hasn't helped.  Its a poor quality printer.  I will be getting rid of it soon and going back to an HP.As other reviewers have said ""I will NEVER buy another Lexmark product again"".  I am in 100% agreement.",0,0
R3U5Z41PH5X30,"I don't know what product these other reviewers received, but the one I received was not solidly built at all. Not even close.Here are all the issues I have with the one I received and this is how it arrived at my door:1) Corner of tabletop is broken. Where the corners of the wood meet, they are not attached. Like they forgot to glue it or simply did so poorly and it detached.2) The ""magnetic"" piece that is supposed to hold the top down when flat is, well, NOT magnetic, has lost all magnetism, or simply isn't a strong enough magnet. So it doesn't connect at all stay down flat. It's the plastic/metal white piece you see in the picture.3) The bar of wood on the tabletop that holds the laptop in place when the top is up has a long crack along it. Who knows when that piece will break off.4) The metal rod/latch that is meant to lock into place to prop the tabletop up doesn't even fit right into the wood slots. You have to jam it in and even when you do, it's barely in there so it will likely fall out if you move around a bit. I don't know about you, but I don't want that top collapsing on my fingers or anything else when I have it propped up.Similarly, the metal rod is fairly flimsy, isn't properly aligned, which contributes to why it doesn't fit well into the wood slots (how you adjust the vertical nature of the tabletop). The rods also aren't secured to the wood, so it can simply pop-out of the top.5) Just in general, the wood has little holes and chipped pieces all over. It's as if they don't inspect these things at all because all of these flaws were SO noticeable. I saw all of this within a minute of unpacking the thing.6) This leads me to the packaging of the product and what might have contributed to 1 or 2 of the issues above (but certainly not all of them). There was no protection in the packaging. It came box that was the same size as the table, with no padding. Unless you call a single strip of 1mm foam paper on 1 side of the table protection. Clearly it didn't do the job.I have pictures of all of the above issues. I wish there was a way to post them in this review.Conclusion:NOT worth $40. This is the equivalent of a $1-$5 purchase at a yard sale of 5 year old items that have seen a lot of wear and tear. I'll be seeking a return slip now.",0,0
R2R21RXLTOM66C,"After I wrote the below review, I already ran out of the 2nd color cartridge today--the one I'd replaced the first one which I felt had run out quickly. Well, this one ran out twice as quickly as the first one, which was bad enough. ! I don't think that 2nd cartridge was in my printer for a week even. I am shocked to be frank. The color XL is rated 450 pages per 5% coverage. I don't think I even got 100 pages! It's not saving money if you only get 1/4 of what you are supposed to get. I have a deadline today, I was sure I had plenty of ink, and now I have to run out to Staples. Total rip off.Original review: I use remanufactured cartridges all the time. Hadn't used this company. Bought 2 sets a month apart, , since I'd forgotten I'd bought the first set and reordered. No problem, I can always use the extra ink. So for the first batch:  I noticed immediately that the ink smells very strong and bad when the pages come off the printer. This is not a deal breaker if everything else worked fine, but it was noticeable and odd, never smelled that before on printer ink. But considering that the cartridges were hi yield, they ran out very quickly relatively speaking. I hardly printed in color to speak of and that color cartridge ran out in a few weeks!  That should have lasted at a few months based on what I was printing.  I will not buy this product again.",0,0

I know it may be harsh to give this a one star based solely on the fact that an incoming call is going to be heard no matter what, but this would be a reason I would not buy this machine again if I was to shop for another machine.

It had great reviews.The printer gave us trouble from the beginning. It constantly went offline and every time I went to print it became a 10-20 minute hassle that involved me taking my computer down to the printer and checking and rechecking everything so the whole ""wireless"" idea was basically eliminated. Early on I spent a few days and over an hour on the phone with a tec support rep and finally had it up and running. It worked for the most part but we still had issues every few months. (We don't do a lot of printing.)Now it's giving me trouble again, randomly going offline, printing barely legible (might be toner? Though the test pages print perfectly.) and I just called support to get some trouble shooting. I had to fill out a form online just to get a phone number to call. The form let me know that my warranty expired, which I assumed meant I couldn't send it back, but it also means I can't receive any tech support on the phone. I only found that out after calling tech support, going through all the back and forth of name, phone, email, serial #, product#, etc before he says, ""I can't give you any support over the phone. You can go online and look around there.""Thanks. If that had worked the first time, I wouldn't have called.I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because there were times when it worked.

R33R49IMECLTNQ,"Addendum: 8/42/2020I was contacted by Smart Ink customer service after I posted my initial review below. They apologized and offered me a replacement or a full refund. I chose the full refund because I already bought other ink. I was contacted immediately by customer service and they initiated a full refund. No matter what product or service one may choose, good, bad or indifferent, a great customer service experience always trumps a sour taste. Smart Ink has removed that sour taste from my mouth and I am thankful for that.I don't have too much to say except that I was in a rush to buy some cheap ink. I usually buy IKONG ink for my HP 6600 but again I was in a pinch and needed ink the next day. So, I seen this ink set with a cute little branding (the ink dude with glasses) and read like 1 or 2 reviews, so I bought it.I put in place all the new Smart Ink cartridges and began to print and everything I printed had both lines through it and missing black ink (I typically only print out journal articles for school). I did this several more times and same thing. I cleaned the printhead, not exaggerating, like 30-40 times, still the same problem. Feeling utterly defeated I thought something was wrong with my printer and that I would have to get it repaired or worse buy a new one.I decided first to try my longstanding ink brand IKONG, so I purchased it and when it arrived I replaced all the ink cartridges. Lo and behold all my documents came out perfect. I included pictures of the differences of both ink brands I purchased (Smart Ink and the IKONG), you can see for yourself.I didn't need to get repairs or buy a new printer.

It's definitely very sturdy, but it's not for me.I'm an adult, with mild Asperger's syndrome, and fairly severe ADHD (although even that was not diagnosed until college, but that was at least in part because it was masked by a combination of severe social anxiety, which lead to extreme efforts not to call attention to myself, and high intellegence, which allowed me to compensate accademically through most of my education).  This might be good for a younger child, who prefers or requires larger toys, a more severely autistic individual who might be less bothered by the size (and certainly the appearance of carrying arround something this size), or someone who just has bigger hands than I do.I gave it two stars because it does seem durable and well-made, and has an interesting texture, but no more because it was not a size or shape I liked, and I think the keychain is silly.",0,0

Any way, defective product. Zero stars if that was an option.",0,0
RSGLDK3WGQZ6N,"Not great for my kitchen. Attractive product but mostly not functional unless the cookbook is open. There is a significant gap (almost one inch wide) along the entire 11.5"" length of the holder that allows magazines and or cookbooks to fall through if the magazine or book is unopened (most thick magazines fall through regardless of size due to the gap). I like to set out cookbooks or cooking magazines that I will be utilizing over the course of a week and if I set them on my book holder at least the 1-2 books fall through the gap. If I could I would return for a better product as I believe this is a very poor design on the most fundamental basis. 1 star is for the fact that it is attractive and sturdy enough and it does function with a single opened book if the spine is greater than 1 inch.",0,0

Colors like champagne-ny type glittering cream colors!  i was even going to keep the set anyway! But as i kept swatching, the situation just got worse snd worse. i don’t know if i just got a bad set and it was a fluke because so many reviews were positive.

R16OQ3Y1VNZZOE,"I've been using these cartridges in an Epson WF-2540 printer for months with no problem other than a warning message about them not being genuine Epson cartridges.  If I had done this review before yesterday, it definitely would have been a five star review.  However, yesterday one of these cartridges actually damaged my printer, rendering it inoperable.  Here's what happened.  After what should have been a routine replacement of the yellow cartridge, the printer reported that the cartridge was not installed correctly.  Removing the cartridge proved more difficult than usual, which seemed very odd.  (At the time, I thought this might just be due to a slightly tight fit along the sides of these cartridges.)  After removing and reinstalling the cartridge, I got the same message again.  It wasn't until I removed the cartridge the second time that I noticed the cartridge chip was missing.  Turns out the chip had somehow fallen off inside the grey plastic bag the cartridge is packaged in.  Unfortunately, even a genuine Epson cartridge won't work for me know, since the rough surface under where the chip should have been on the remanufactured chip damaged the chip contacts inside the printer.  Fortunately, after some research I found that the chip contacts are relatively inexpensive and can be fairly easily replaced.  However, even if this works as I hope, it has been a big time drain and pain in the butt.  Another troubling thing is that this does not appear to be a one-off situation.  The other yellow cartridge I have from the set I purchased has the same exact problem.  See pics of cartridge with disconnected chip and damage to contacts (which have been removed from the printer).  Bottom line, great price on ink cartridges that generally seem to work well, but I would definitely watch for this missing chip issue before installing the cartridges.",0,0

R14RN6BU2ZKPIP,"If I could give 0 stars, I would. The female brass thread insert fell out of the body of the pen when I tried to swap a blue insert into my new pen. You obviously need this part to stay in the pen, the two halves of the pen that house the refill are rather important. Ok. So I glued it back in because there was no keeping it together otherwise. At this point, I could have returned it but for such a minor issue, it wasn't worth the trouble. Or so I thought. Apparently the body that somehow warped enough for the threaded insert to fall out in the first place, after literally owning the pen less than a week now, no longer accepts the CAP. Well, great. So I have a pen that I can screw/unscrew, but not cap. I'd send it back to them for repair or replacement, but they require you box and pay for shipping yourself. Not terribly atypical, but if this is typical of the pen I don't have any interest in paying for postage on the off-chance it *might* be fixed by Fisher. That's just throwing good money after bad. I collect pens, I have pens that cost from two dollars to 750 dollars. This is by far the worst pen experience I've had so far.Oh, and for the record, the metal this pen is made of is so thin and cheap that when I pushed too hard to try and force the cap on, the bottom of the pen dented. The coating seems tough, but the pen is softer than any plastic pen I own. Also, the novelty of the refills wears off and you eventually realize it doesn't write as well as cheap uniballs, either. A huge step down from the fountain pens I'm used to, but I wanted something that works on the carbon copies I use at work.",0,0

So far it works as advertised and I’m worried it’ll randomly fail like other people says theirs did.

R1LEVN5G6KMRMH,"Do not. Under any circumstances. Buy this printer.With two older HP Inkjets slowly fading, I purchased the B210 from a big box store. It had a built-in scanner! It was network capable, so our household would only need the one! It was marked down... to a remarkable degree... And there, even with the rapid changes of inventory that occur at many big-box stores, I probably should have heard warning bells.The one good thing I will say is that the print quality is fine. But over the course of a month, in which we print maybe a few dozen pages with minimal color (we're talking school reports that might have the occasional piece of clip art and a search engine map or two, not high resolution photos) the printer burns through ink cartridges that are supposed to get hundreds of prints. Expensive ink cartridges. And since the printer kindly took it on itself to download an update, it refuses to play nicely with recycled ink cartridges. No, no. Only expensive, factory-fresh brand-name ink cartridges will do it for this little monster.It also scans to a computer... Maybe twice... before losing its connection and having to be shut down and started up again to continue scanning. I will note that it's in the same room as the router and modem, and the computer it's scanning *to* is all of twenty-five feet away.This printer has put me off of HP, possibly for life.

The only thing I would discuss with them is a refund.Often when I try to print something, I have to reboot my whole system in order to do it.  Sometimes I will get the error message that it is not communicating, and sometimes it just quits and nothing happens.  I have done updates several times that are supposed to take care of the issue, and it never does - it might work okay for a few days, and then it is right back with the problem again.  I have purchased nothing but Lexmark ink cartridges and have still had several printing issues.  In spite of deep cleaning the printheads, it never prints well and always has streaks; so it is pretty much useless for color printing.  As other reviews said, it was okay for awhile when I first got it; then I assume the printhead got messed up after a few months of usage.  I had to return some cartridges as a couple of them could not be authenticated although they were Lexmark.  I did yet another update this afternoon in order to correct the communication problem, and now I cannot get it to print in color at all.

I once again called customer service, and after an hour of troubleshooting they had no advice for me.  I indicated that I wanted a new printer, which they denied.Horrible customer service.  Buggy, twitchy software. Buy it if you have time to coax it into printing every time you want something simple done, otherwise stay FAR FAR AWAY from this piece of junk.",0,0

R1LG59P5N32R7M,"I bought this chair back in January of this year and it started out okay, but slowly fell victim to what most computer chair do(at least for me). The seat plate, it's seem to always be the first thing to go on any computer chair and so I contacted the company since it's still under warranty. I received everything alright, so customer support was decent enough. Well it's only been a couple of months and the seat plate is already bad. I still could contact the company and have another one sent out, but at this point I don't think it would help. I'm not sure why the weld is so weak on every seat plate.I even had a chair weight rated up to 1000lbs(stationary weight), but even that did the same. So I'm not sure what to purchase for a chair anymore, beside trying to make my own(I don't have tools to do so). The other issue with this chair is its less then a year old and has many issue. The wheels don't roll well(yes I know carpet doesn't help) the seat cushion is flat, it creaks, and is really uncomfortable after a couple of hours. Don't buy this chair, save your money.",0,0

R30JAN4ZXY934I,"This is a good chair with one glaring flaw. The seat height is set via a clamping mechanism consisting of eight, 1"" x .6"" inch ""stopper rubbers"" made of a type of soft, rubber tubing. (5/16"" ID) The manual states that the stopper rubbers should be changed as an entire set (8) ""if you see any cracking or damage"". I noticed some cracking (see photo) within 9 months of purchase during light use (2-4 hours/wk) and I only weigh 180lbs. I just found out from the manufacturer that replacements cost $6.95 ea ($55.60 for a set of 8) plus shipping of $40. I paid approx. $100 for the chair which means I would essentially need to re-up the original purchase price every year just for maintenance. Several Amazon reviewers suggested using fuel hose from an auto parts store and I'm currently investigating that avenue... most hoses with the correct measurements appear to be $1-$5/foot range so the price is definitely better. The original stopper rubbers appear to be made of a more ""squishy"" rubber... possibly a vinyl or PVC blend. If I find something that works well, I'll try to post it for those who find themselves in the same boat as me. If not, I'll ditch this one and try another suggestion, purchase a highly-rated ""astronomy"" chair.",0,0

R1I00Z7Y8D9X9N,"I purchase this paper thinking I was going to be able to use it with my inkjet printer, as it was very unclear in the description. This paper is made for SUBLIMATION INK ONLY, this is NOT going to work with you inkjet printer at all. I thought I would try anyway (to see if at least it could be used as normal paper) and the normal ink just bleeds all over it.I had never heard about sublimation ink before, and after looking it up, it became clear I was not going to buy any equipment to be able to use this paper. It is pretty expensive. I might as well just buy the proper paper for my printer.Anyway, I asked around and finally found somebody that owns a little sublimation printer. I learned that you can actually buy sublimation ink and fill refillable cartridges to convert your normal printer. So we met to try to print some design on shirts (this was my initial project). The paper comes in a clear plastic bag with a sticker on it that tells you which side to print on, so you better not remove it from there. It feels like normal paper, both sides looks the same. You also get instructions with the temperatures and pressing time you need for different materials. The instructions says the material of the shirts has to be 100% polyester or it won't stick to it (so no cotton).We did not have a heat press, so we used an iron as directed. I do not know what went wrong, but it did not work. The design did not print very neatly, and when trying to transfer, some of it just did not stick to the shirt.The last paragraph on the instructions says that you can not return the product. Again, I did not know what I was buying and I am not sure if I did something wrong, but it really did not work. I will use this paper to write on it, I guess. The quality is not very good and I was not impressed at all. If you are looking for something thinking you are going to be able to use this to make shirts or anything else, I would keep looking.

It's an automatic calibration, so I don't know of a way to calibrate it with a different weight.The scales are not accurate as advertised. I mistakenly bought a 100g weight (also from Smart Weigh) as other reviews refer to a 100g weight for calibration (this is perhaps required  for a different scale, as Amazon will often lump reviews for different models of the same product together). On a flat, stable and level surface the 100g calibration weight is reported to weigh between 100.2 and 100.5g, i.e. it will report different weights for the same calibration weight.

The original order came as shown in the advertising pictures on the product page... nice quality envelopes in a nice box. Same red product box as shown. Used them up, so I reordered, expecting the same product. Why wouldn't I? Sadly,  what I received this time wasn't even close!This time, what I received was exactly what you see in pictures I've attached to the review. First, no product box at all. Just a pile of loose envelopes in bubble wrap, shipped in a plain Amazon Bag...no product box, nor Amazon shipping box.Even worse, the envelopes are not the same either. They may or may not be the same weight of paper, though they feel lighter weight. The flaps for closing are about half the size of the prior envelopes, and the one I pulled out had almost NO adhesive on it at all. The interior privacy markings were also of a different pattern including the mfgr name now, and less privacy marking overall as well. IOW, They look nothing like the pictures on the product page. I could live with the cheap haphazard packaging, but for the envelopes themselves to be completely different and of lesser quality...this is just sad.Give how the product has changed to a much lower quality envelope, combined with lack of packaging, and haphazard shipping, this product listing is at best, misleading...and bordering on bait and switch.

R10M82G82I5LE4,"September 2018.  The containers are well enough with straight sides for files to fit in nicely.  The reason I didn't give it a better rating is because the lids are lightweight, flimsy and non-stackable where I wouldn't want to stack more than two together.  I don't think these lids can take the weight of 3 stacked together.  And even worse, they do not lock into place when stacked which is a major disappointment.  The boxes slide around easily on top each other when stacked which is a ridiculous feature for file boxes.  The lids are not as advertised.  The lids I received are from a different mold, having no inner track for the bottom of boxes to sit.  Heaven forbid someone bumps into them and all your top boxes slide off and fall over and your files spill out.  I'd rather pay more money if they would improve the lids by making them stronger, more durable and stackable.  In using plastic boxes for decades, I find it's the lids that usually break first.  Unfortunately, a customers who purchased these in 2016 and 2017 received well made locking lids so people are buying this based on their 5 star rating.  For my purchase, they obviously went downhill in quality and used a different manufacturer for the lids, cutting corners and making this a less than desirable purchase.

R309K7W3BBVV5U,"I'm about to order my third Commodore II chair, just about a month shy of three years since I bought my current one.  That's about how many years I get out of them before they die.  Earlier today I came into my office, took a seat in my chair... and immediately sank to the floor as the gas strut failed.  That's what happened to the last one too and it's not that I'm overloading them either.  The chairs are rated to 350 lbs. and I'm barely 280, so well within the limitations.  Still, these are the only chairs affordable enough for me that also include a back and headrest tall enough for my 6'2"" body to lean back in and be properly supported.  Heck, the number of naps I've taken in these chairs makes the cost per year of use pretty reasonable, though I do wish they'd last longer.EDIT 03/30/21: About to order my 4th chair.  This last one lasted a whopping 9 months from unboxing to today.  I purchased it in Nov of 2018 but didn't unbox it because we were moving at the end of 2019.  Then Covid hit and that delayed things a year so I unboxed it last June.  As of this week it sinks halfway to the floor every time I sit in it.  These chairs are rated for 350 lbs but I'm just 285.

R1B9HIFLTWKVBJ,"Yes, this product is much less expensive than the outrageous price HP charges for their  ""genuine"" HP ink.  Here is what to expect.  When you first install these on your HP printer, depending on model, you will receive a cautionary message about using other than HP genuine ink.  we ignored this message of course.  After installation, the colored images printed with Starink were not very true to life.  In fact, they were considerably off and we noted some runs in the initial pages we printed.  The runs mostly cleared up after a few pages were printed, but the colors were still off.  The black works fine for printing text.  We didn't mind the colors being off considering the savings.  Here is where I have a real problem.  Starink claims their product is ""high capacity.""  However, the colored ink cartridges ran out rather quickly and we printed far fewer pages than with the HP cartridges.  That doesn't mean we're going back to HP ink, but be aware these alternative products won't necessarily give you the quality or service they claim.  I will likely look into some other brands.

R1R98LNK6UB4SQ,"I wish there were a zero star option for this product.

Would not trust this product in the field if rain is near.The inner sleeves do not hold papers in place, they tend to slide out and get jammed between top and bottom componentsby the hinges, making closing even more difficult.The sticker, yeah I knew it was gonna be a problem from the other reviews, haven't made the attempt to remove it yet..For the money, you would expect better build quality and better shipping care.

I just threw it back into the box and found out the stain won't come out of anything it touched.The rubbed off color severely stained my hands (my picture couldn't quite show how bad it really was), which wouldn't wash off (i washed my hands several times throughout the day for over a week until it was finally gone) and my skin felt like it was burning until I managed to get the dye off.It doesn't say anywhere in the item description what was used to dye the cover, so I have no idea what the hell it is.

I purchased two pens at once, and both pens leak ink on the top of the nib, this then collects in the top cap of the pen, when the top cap is on the pen. The pen continues to leak ink even when not in use. I am constantly cleaning out the top cap.  The pen is not a very smooth writer, the nib is scratchy when writing on paper. I am using Pilot cartridges.I understand this is an entry level pen,but, ink should not leak, when the pen is not in use.Considering this is happening with both pens, there is obviously a design flaw or poor quality control.I have a Cross Fountain pen that cost $25.00 and it does not have any of the issues that the Pilot Metropolitan has, and the Cross is a much smoother writer.",0,0

RGS1AAXEKVR1N,"I thought this was a steal for $99 on Black Friday 2 years ago. There's a reason they were practically giving these away. It worked ok out of the box but after about 3 months it lost its driver and I had to delete it from my system (Win7) and re-add it. This seemed to go on every 3 or 4 months. Recently my color toner cartridge lights (all 3) came on which means it's time to change the cartridges. I bought 3 new ones ($150 later) and it kept alarming with a red error light. Once that light comes on there is no way to bypass it to print. Samsung support had me try several things to try to get it to work again but finally gave up and said it needed to be serviced. They also told me it was beyond its 2 yr warranty and I would have to pay for shipping, parts etc. All this after I just paid $150 for toner cartridges. Thankfully I bought the cartridges at Office Depot and they were kind enough to let me exchange them for a new printer instead. I went with a Brother HL-3170 this time.

I've also had the print head replaced twice. I've tried everything I could to get a refund direct from Lexmark, but their strict policy only allows for continued ""repairs"" until the problem is fixed. In that sense (and in fairness to the Lexmark brand) they're very responsive and try hard to make it right (hence the repeated replacements.) But the problem, it turns out, is that the printers aren't broken. They're just poorly created.The problems:* Routine paper jams* Frequent ink leaks - several times, when printing photos, the paper has come out completely saturated with one color of ink or another.* CONSTANT color issues: when printing photos, colored text, etc., it invariably comes out with discolorations (blue = green, black = gray, etc.)* The touchscreen freezes about 3/4 of the time i use it, requiring a reboot to continue use* The scanning quality seems lower than advertised - always comes through a fuzzy* The print quality - when it DOES print correctly (rare) - is still very low. Not sharp, not vibrant.I'm somewhat computer savvy and have tried EVERYTHING recommended on the site to remedy my problems - updated drivers, firmware, etc. No luck.FYI: I'm using it wirelessly with my new MacBook Pro, so my only thought is some sort of operating system incompatibility, which might explain others' satisfaction with this printer.For me, though, it was a big mistake. And even though I'm on my 3rd, shiny new one, I'm going to buy a different brand of printer, because it's essentially useless.Stay away!

Even once I manage to grip them, only one of the 3 writes consistently without skipping and having to be primed.  I'm still getting smudges on my hand, so it's not helping in that sense, either.  I guarantee my hand writing is not one bit more legible with the lefty pen than it is with the Wexford pen I normally use, and the Wexford has a much nicer grip.

If you learned to write upside down in a right hander's world, don't bother.  If you learned to write as a lefty should have learned, maybe.This is an update after I shared these pens with one of my left handed co-workers.  His opinion was almost identical to mine, and he's a good 20 years younger than me. I guess it's not just us old dogs that don't like thse pens.  This is a 2nd update.

The footrest I received does not have a base with a flat bottom. It has 2 semi-circle shaped pieces on the bottom that allow it to ""rock."" But when you set it down, it is unevenly weighted so it sits with the back to the floor (see photo). VERY disappointed and not sure why Amazon hasn't addressed this yet.",1,1

R1L36WV9P94EY7,"Stay completely away from this printer. I should've not believed the reviews. Worst printer I've had. Quality of print is so-so, but it has so many quirks that make it undesirable. For instance, printing 2-sided is quite slow; the manual feed tray holds just ONE page! When you do envelopes, you have to sit at the printer and feed them one-by-one. Are you kidding me?! It does not like any paper other than regular 24lb. paper. Forget brochure paper, or other glossy. Terrible. Stay away.",0,0
R2PJPGYQ192PVJ,"So many reviews said the quality was great and paper was thick...they must not have ordered the ivory ones. These envelopes were VERY thin.

R3LYZ7V47EVF60,"THESE ARE NOT MUJI PENS!!! These are KNOCK-OFFS!! I have Muji pens, and I bought these because I saw the photos and thought they were muji. After looking more into the reviews I realized they are not real muji pens. They have a muji tag on them but they are fakes! I bought a real Muji pen in store and the head of the pen is short with the body being a bit slimmer than the fake pen. The fake has a longer head with a thicker body. The real Muji pens also do not come with a blue protective topping on the pen before use. These pens may be decent quality, but if you want a really Muji pen, don't buy these.",0,0

R2XS1VOXXUHW1P,"I received the Veho VFS-002m scanner for Christmas a few days ago, eager to get to work scanning decades of old Instamatic 110 negatives. The Veho VFS-002m is one of only a handful of scanners to include a tray for 110 negatives. It's a pity, because the film holders are this scanner's best attribute. With the bundled Arcsoft scanning software, and using a fairly new Core i5 laptop, scans of 110 and 35mm negatives were both very speedy. People who complained in their reviews that the scans were slow should try putting some money into a faster computer. The scanner itself isn't doing a bit of the processing. In fact, as near as I can tell, it just backlights the image for a photo sensor. The film holder must be manually slid from image to image. Not a deal breaker, especially since it does scan quickly with a fast processor, but it does make lining up the image a little tricky.The main issue is that the image quality that you get in your scans is not good. I have an older, but very high quality Minolta Dimage III scanner which I typically use for 35mm slide and negative scanning. I was hopeful that I'd be getting a scanner which, while maybe not quite as good, would be in the same ballpark - using newer, cheaper technology. Not a chance. Even with relatively large 35mm source material, the Veho VFS-002m only managed mediocre image quality. The lighting is uneven and small details, like faces, are a pixelated mess. Larger details and backgrounds are recognizable, but this isn't scanner which will let you archive your old photos. It's fine for scanning old photos to email or post on Facebook, but the image quality just isn't there to produce acceptable prints. With 110 negatives, the problem is much worse since the source image is about 1/4 the size of 35mm. Faces are barely recognizable blobs of pixels with all detail lost. All other small details get lost as well. As with 35mm sources, the quality is probably good enough to email a picture to family or post online, but it's not nearly good enough to ever allow new prints to be made (not without sacrificing too much in image quality, in my opinion).Basically, this scanner does what it says it will. It's easy to use, mostly because it's so simplistic. The film trays work well enough, but it's a shame they only work in THIS scanner. I guess I was expecting too much considering the price range it falls in, but with no higher grade option available for 110 negatives, it's unfortunate the image quality produced is so bad. For 35mm slides and negatives, there are many more (and better) options from better known companies. They may cost a little more, but the improved quality is probably worth the extra money. If all you want is 35mm scanning, look elsewhere. If you have to scan 110 film, whether this is an option for you will depend on what you want to do with the images. For me, I'm looking to find a way to permanently digitize a lifetime of old photos so they can be shared, cropped and reprinted at will. This scanner just can't do that for me.",0,0

R2018P8P23MV92,I bought this printer for my office about a yr and half ago thinking it would be a nice wireless addition to go with my brother and canon printers that are on our office network.  So far to date i have successfully printed less than 100 pages on this paper weight.The printer will work for 1 to 2 pages then it goes off line.  Sometimes if you turn it on and off it will work again but usually not.  I own an a surveying company and have several laser printers and plotters.

R20S3UAWISN4D9,"I really like the look of these pens. I got one from a dollar store and gave it to my granddaughter. She loved it and uses it all the time. Then my grandson wanted one so I looked to amazon. I saw this set of 8. They look exactly like the one I had. Despite the multitude of negative reviews, which mostly reported gems falling out and things I felt I could fix, I made the purchase. The pens came with all gems attached and I thought all was good. I gave one to my grandson and another to my granddaughter. After a few minutes my granddaughter was asking what that was on the floor. It looked like a giant beetle, but upon closer examination, it was a blob of ink that had been stepped on. It was all over the place. On the couch, all over the floor, on my pants, and the kids feet and clothes. I found it had poured out of the bottom of the pen I gave my granddaughter - the new one from this pack. I confiscated the one I gave to my grandson and quarantined them in the bag they came in. I don't trust them and will probably discard the entire package. The good news is that the ink did come out of almost everything. The suede couch still has stains on it, but we do not have a cleaner to use on it yet. My feelings are that if you really like these pens - invest in a good brand.",0,0

You will always have tons of unused ink but the printer won't let you use it. All the colors always get empty at the same time? C'mon really, what are the odds?

R1HOPN0IUCU35B,"Not a well behaved ink. While it performs fairly well on high end paper (Clairefontaine, Rhodia, and Quo Vadis) it is extremely wet and will spread, feather, and bleed on typical copy paper and even mid range notebooks. If you plan to use this ink solely on 80-90gsm paper designed for fountain pens you will be pleased with the very attractive sheen that it produces. You will need to make sure that you gently shake the bottle and mix the very fine gold particles before filling your pen/converter. It would also be wise to gently agitate the ink in the pen prior to writing to achieve a consistent golden sheen while writing. This will only require very gentle agitation by tipping the pen back and fourth a few times before putting the pen to paper. If this ink was $10 a bottle I would have given it 3 stars. At over double that price at many retailers I expect great performance even on lower end paper.",0,0

Much harder than an IKEA cabinet, for example.The build quality is where the one star is in order. The drawer faces are very different in width - incredible. The back panel does not fit well, making it very hard to nail and the long term result will be that the cabinet will loosen up and start to sway. I had to cut wood to get it to set at all; still a bad fit.

And yes the paper jams and it doesn't matter what quality paper you use or how you ""fan"" it. The print quality varies for no obvious reason whatever ink you use and is often too poor to use e.g. the kids homework. I don't agree with the reviewer who implied that the low performance is because the product is cheap. It should still do what it says it will to a satisfactory standard.

R2ZAUDRIZG1IOP,"I have a month-old Lexmark. This burns through ink at a ridiculous rate. When it starts running out of ink, rather than lighten the text, it will print out whole pages with blotches of nothing-- thus wasting me sixty pages of paper as well as all that ink on pages I can't use.It will say the printhead is out of alignment. So I eject the ink and put it back in. This is a standard error it gives me. Then it follows and says the cyan blue is missing. It's not, but I eject, and replace the cyan blue, so it stops giving me that error. It does this EVERY SINGLE TIME.Then it will sometimes just say the computer and the printer cannot communicate, when the printer is plugged into the computer already.Then if it tries to print, but can't for some reason, it freezes up my whole (brand new) computer.This is a piece of crap, and if I hadn't been past the 15-day return period at Office Depot, I would've returned this.I haven't gone through 1.25 reams of paper, and I've gone through five inks-- that's at 25 bucks a pop.This is a huge waste of money and a terrible printer.

R10Q484V2MRK9W,"I bought this slide scanner as a birthday present for a friend who had many slides he'd not viewed for a couple of decades.  He is a graphic artist, with a professional eye for how images should look, and was, unfortunately, not impressed by the quality of the scans.  They were not square, but slightly fish-eye in appearance, with colour bleed from one side.  The worst point, however, was the level of pixellation of the images; details such as writing, whilst readable on the projected slides, were illegible on the scanned images, and smaller details were a blocky mess.My friend returned the scanner to Amazon, and used the credit towards a much better, and considerably more expensive device, the Canon 5600F, which he tells me he is very pleased with.I have given the Veho one star, as it does scan slides, just not to a very high quality.

Then it indicated I was low on black toner.  I bought black toner, and turned the printer back on.  What was a flashing red light turned solid, and the printer would not print.  I contacted customer suppoort online.  They told me to clean the printer and send them the serial number on the toner to make sure I was using genuine Samsung cartridge.  I did that.  The problem did not go away.  The Smartpanel software gave me a ""Home Dev. Error"" message and I contacted customer support again.  Then finally after 6 weeks of waiting for a response, I contacted them again, telling them how disappointed I was the lack of response and how I would like to get the problem resolved preferably before warranty runs out.  So they gave me a link for requesting service.  I clicked on it, filled the form out, clicked to send it, and guess what...online service requesting is not available for my product.  What?  The page said to call a 800 number.  By this time I was so incensed I sent thm another message, telling them they have wasted enough of my time, and that all their consumers should be able to avail of online service requests.  I said I was not going to call the number, and that I prefer to let people know how seriously badly they treat customers.",0,0
R3861KM44XVNXD,"This smooth rolling work cart is suitable for light duty only. I had it parked undisturbed for about a week with an 80 lb benchtop drillpress on the top tray. A caster mount on the bottom tray failed overnight one night, tipping the cart, and dumping the drillpress to the floor, damaging it and items on the adjacent shelves. The failure was direct shear on an obvious manufacturing fault, a void in the injection molded corner boss.As a light duty work cart, it works well, rolling silently and smoothly. It would get 4 stars if not for the failure under what seems to me to be a reasonbale load.",0,0
R6YKPKLZG0NYB,"This is TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE ink!!!  Yes, physically the cartridge fits in my Canon printer -- BUT -- it is terrible quality ink, and it smears EXTREMELY easy.Note that this problem persists (apparently) forever -- even weeks after I print a document, it readily smears if I make the mistake of touching it!!!  (See attached image, which I printed 2-3 weeks ago, but which readily smeared today!!!)This makes it entirely unsuitable for my purposes.  When using original Canon ink, I have never had any such problems.  This was my first try at using off-brand ink -- and clearly I'll go back to using Canon ink (and suffer the high price).===========UPDATE ON 3/27/19:  The customer support team sent me a set of replacement ink cartridges, so I'll add a star for the good customer service.  Once I try the ink again I will update my review accordingly (first I need to use up the Canon ink that I purchased after I discarded the Smart Ink cartridges).",0,0
R22023G8NJR6I2,"I really wanted to love this chair. The black leather and chrome styling was exactly what I was looking for to compliment my new ultra-modern office.The packaging arrived undamaged and well wrapped and the instructions were easy enough to follow.The leather seems well enough sticked and I didn't see any noticeable defects.A few big problems that really disappointed me though.The precut holes don't align properly which results in the back and bottom of the chair being offset. The right side of the chair sits a half inch higher than the left. Several frustrating attempts at tweaking did nothing to solve this. Not only does this throw off the styling but it also ruins the seating position and makes the whole chair feel awkward.If this weren't enough the chair is stiff and uncomfortable, not what you're expecting at all  from an oversized chair. Its rated for 350lbs...at 185lbs the padding feels inadequate for me and I can't imagine sitting in it for more than a couple hours.If I had paid $50 for the chair I might forgive the poor quality but at $190+ I feel ripped off. Now I'm left with either the hassel of disassembling it again and attempting to return it or just taking the $200 loss.Lesson learned? Next time I'll take my money to Costco.",0,0
R3FRMMU7NV63AF,"This would be the perfect printer if it would connect to wifi and have clear simple instructions. After many hours with six tech support people over two days the printer would not connect to wifi where I easily connect iPhone, iPad and Macbook to wifi effortlessly. It prints great with USB but I got it for iPad printing. The few directions that come with the machine are so cryptic, it's best to just call support (which they were always there and easy to access). I got so many different reasons, 'you have to push WPS on your router', 'it's doesn't work on 5 Ghz' ( Fios told me my router was putting out 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz so the printer should work with 2.4), 'restart router, computer and printer', do it again, do it again, 'get another computer and do it all again'..I'm choosing to return it and look for a more Mac-like brand of printer.  I buy Mac products to avoid this type of frustrating experience to accomplish something that should simply work. It may be just this unit has a bad wifi card, if the wifi would have connected effortlessly, I would give this 5 stars because it is nice and compact, prints well and affordable.",0,0

RZ4NO3MVJZOUI,"I wanted to like this. Low cost, perfect size for a nightstand. But I couldn't. The battery holder is difficult to get to without tearing the foam lining, and feels extremely cheaply made. More importantly, I was never able to program the lock. I even tried a simple 3 code left-center-right. The code was confirmed by the double beep, but I could never get the lock to open. Maybe it was because one press on a button resulted in several actual presses of the button. I would press the left button, and would hear 5-10 beeps in a row.Unfortunately, I've seen several reviews about the keypad being junk, and I have to agree with it.

R3T8IU08WEDAUB,"I don't usually write reviews (and I guess I should have read a few more before buying this) but I'm really disappointed in this product. I had just bought a similar product (a calendar) that is beautiful and shiny and smooth and erases nicely and I bought these blank sheets to put up next to the calendar for notes and shopping lists etc. I was expecting the quality to be just as nice but these sheets came filled with massive wrinkles and bubbles ~ it looked like you were supposed to remove a top sheet or something but there is no top sheet to remove! I really loved the idea though and I wanted it to work so i kept it for a few days and tried to use it but that just made it worse. When you erase the board, the ink just accumulates and gets stuck around the edges and it looks awful. Thought maybe I just got a defective one but after reading more reviews it looks like that might not be the case... I'm returning mine today.",1,1
R2XELHQG0UXAX8,"I needed to laminate some white illustration board, which is wider than all the other lamination products I could find, except for this.  It looked very easy, it said it was easy... but it was not.  Like the others reviewing this product, I could not get the backing from even one sheet to remove properly.  I tried many times, but I could only get halfway across the width of the page before the backing split and started leaving paper behind on the plastic.It seems to me that Avery made a ton of this stuff using a poorly made backing paper that, after a short shelf-life, looses its ability to resist the adherence to the sticky. That's the only thing I can think of to explain why most users have the same experience as I did, but some do not.  In my opinion, don't take the risk.I have since found a product from Duck called Laminate Adhesive Peel N' Stick Shelf Liner (Clear) that I will try next.

At any rate, it arrived with a corner of the main box piece badly bent—not damaged in shipping—making the fancy cardboard box look like a piece of junk.  It also included six plastic channel pieces to go over the edges of the dividers. The fact that there are seven dividers aside, the plastic channel pieces are neither what’s depicted in the instructions nor are capable of doing the job.In sum, it’s usable, but looks old and beat up and lacks the plastic edging.

So I file for a replacement and .... they don't accept them, only refunds which means I then have to drive 30 miles to my nearest UPS store to ship back $5.00 worth of ink.

R2B1HRHZZTEVT3,"DUE TO THE RAVE REVIEWS (which I can't, for the life of me, understand)... I ordered not one, but TWO of these hunk'a junk printers.  The first lasted a week before the printhead failed.  I ordered a new printhead which enabled it to work for another couple of weeks and.... you've got it, failed again.  The second printer was still in the box and purchased from a big box store.  After reinstalling the software, setting up the default preferences and in high hopes that the first was a lemon, I was ready to go.  CRAP!  It failed after just a few uses.  No help from Lexmark as I didn't use it immediately or register it.  Well, now I'm stuck with two of these boat anchors that refuse to print anything that has black in it.  The cyan will print but smudgingly so.  I'm thinking the poor design of the black cartridge is an issue.  Therein might lie a big part of the problem.  However, hooking it up to wi-fi and using the fax is just nuts.  I have had no luck with either.  Anyone need two large paperweights?

RQ4HJD60N3IXD,"I am joining the 22% of buyers who rated one or two stars. I have experience in refilling cartridges for other brands. I followed the instructions very carefully.  I had two color and BW cartridges, one set are original Canon that ran out in November, carefully stored, and a newer re-manufactured set from another vendor. We printed up a large quantity of flyers and had mainly used up the blue and black ink. After refilling all four cartridges: The original Canon is not printing red even though that reservoir was relatively full. The remake cartridge is printing all colors, but with dropouts. The cartridges were allowed to sit for a half hour before testing. The black ink is also not working out. I will also mention that my MG2922 did not produce the error messages or indicators the vendor described. This is unacceptable. I gave the vendor benefit of the doubt but I am not the only one who has complained. I will revert to buying pre-filled cartridges. I want to emphasize that I treated them carefully, and both sets were in perfect working condition. Update: after sitting overnight, one color cartridge will not print yellow. Despite the fact that I filled the yellow reservoir. The other color unit has white bars in the blue and red printout despite my conducting an alignment.

R2W2633RL1KEWW,"Pro901 has impressive specifications on paper. The main reason to buy Pro901 was inexpensive black ink because paying $20~30 per ink cartridge seem unreasonable to me.Pro901 had worked well until I stopped using it for a while. As some reviewers had the issue of clogged printhead, I've had the same print quality issue. In order to resolve the issue, I had to run printhead cleaning several times and clean dried ink off from the metal pieces that contact cartridge. For an occasional printer user, this issue is unacceptable.About the design, it definitely looks better in picture than in person. Touch panel looks fancy. One main design flow is the paper support in which printed papers rest. My old Canon printer lowered paper support automatically, but for Pro901 I need to pull out the paper support manually. If I don't fully extend the paper support, the printed paper will be wrinkled since Pro901 eject paper out pretty hard.Yet, I enjoy low cost of black ink and wireless feature. However, knowing there are better printers, I wouldn't recommend Pro901 to my friend.Update>> If color ink is low, Pro901 won't print in black only mode either; removing cartridge won't do a trick. I've read that Pro901 uses a little bit of color ink even for black only printer. Since I use this printer once in a week, I need to run cleaning printhead, which drains color ink, every time to remove clog. This fact negates the benefit of low cost black ink. I've already had too much trouble with this printer. Pro901 is my first and last Lexmark product. I'm giving up on this printer and going to get a Brother laser print.",0,0

I bought this to place under my litter boxes for my cats to keep the carpet tidy because I have one that habitually misses the box on brown stinky things and it would make for faster and easier clean up.Second, I can't review the integrity of this product or provide you any information.  You see, the box just arrived an hour or so ago.  I took the mat out of the box, took the sleeves off that keep it rolled up, and no matter what I do, I can not unroll it.  It is literally rolled up and physically IMPOSSIBLE to unroll.  I've tried to sit on the end and push it open with my feet and I've shaken it.  There is absolutely no way this thing is going to roll out flat.  It's an excellent, 5 star speed bump.  However, it would be impossible to call this product a ""mat"" of any kind in the condition in which it arrived.

R1S43YGSQFU2Y7,"I bought this to replace an ancient HP 880 which I was finding difficult to get replacement cartridges.  For the first 6 months or so the printer worked great - good print quality on black and white, color, paper, pictures etc.  The wireless feature also worked great on several home PC's.  Combined with the low ink price it was a real winner.  Lately however it has performed miserably.  Black ink cartridges although low in cost seem to be consumed after printing 10-20 pages.  I uploaded the firm ware a couple of weeks ago based on on-line chat support from Lexmark.  I was hopeful that this would solve the problems.  No such luck.  I put a new black cartridge in ~ 3 weeks ago.  Print quality seemed pretty good - but now - it has gone bad again already and the print indicator shows the cartridge is nearly empty.  This after no more than 30-40 very simple B&W prints.I have also experienced the problems with the wireless features of the printer.  Initially it worked every time.  Now I get a ""not connected - or no communication"" error about 1/2 the time I try to use the printer.  To clear this you have to unplug the printer and reboot. Major inconvenience especially when you're in a hurry to print something as you're heading out the door.  Next step - will be to contact Lexmark again and see about a new print head.

Extremely annoying!- Tells me my ink supply is low when it's not....of course, you have to clear the warning before you you can print.- God forbid anyone wants to use generic ink...errors pop up telling you this as if you didn't know.

R1JJCZ28FUS4JR,"I don't like writing a negative review because I'm a big fan of Amazon and I certainly don't blame Amazon for this disappointing printer.  I blame Lexmark.  After living with this printer for several months I've decided to ditch it and get one from another well-known manufacturer who I trust and have a good history with (and I should have never abandoned them even temporarily to have a fling with this Lexmark piece of junk).I wouldn't even feel good about giving this printer away for free.  It would simply frustrate and annoy whoever I gave it to.I don't care how inexpensive the ink cartridges are, this printer/scanner has been nothing but grief for us since we got it.  I can't comment on the FAX capability since we never used it.Printer:  color ink runs out FAST.  Printed pages often have white streaks in them.  Printer takes a long time to warm up and is very noisy and ""dramatic"" when it's been sitting idle for a while and then you dare ask it to actually print something.  This printer has also let me down at critical times by running out of ink right when I needed it most, in spite of the fact that the estimated ink remaining display showed over 75% ink remaining.Scanner: the scanner feed mechanism is cheap trash.  It jams far more than it feeds.  Had to use the manual flatbed scanning technique 99% of the time, which is very tedious.  This model doesn't allow you to scan in legal size documents or really anything much bigger than 8.5"" x 11"".  If you have a lot of double-sided documents to scan and/or odd-sized paper, don't bother with this one.Software:  it nags you repeatedly to register it, even when you click cancel every time.  This is a network printer, and many of us will likely be installing the drivers and software on multiple PCs.  We don't want to be nagged on every single one of them.  Let me register the printer ONCE and then get out of my face, Lexmark.  Stop nagging me.  Or at least give me the option to turn off the nag screens permanently after the first time and then respect that choice.I don't know if it's true, but I've also read online in more than one source that the Lexmark software constanly ""phones home"" to the motherhship with your printer usage data.  If we want to participate in your passive-aggressive market research, we'll tell you.  Don't be stealthy about it, jerks.I realize this is a very inexpensive printer with probably too many features packed into such a small sized unit.  We get what we pay for when it comes to hardware. Shame on me for going the cheap route.  It really does none of its ""all in one"" functions very well.  I tried to use print, copy, and scan many times and it was always a nuisance.  The FAX transmission may or may not work well--never tried it--but with scanning so difficult at least half of the FAXing process would always be a tiresome chore.There are at least two other printer manufacturers that are far superior to Lexmark.  You probably already know their names.  I strongly suggest you don't be fooled by the 'cheapest ink in the biz' advertising and pass Lexmark over for one of the better printers.  It's not cheap if you have to waste your time constantly battling a device which should be a reliable silent partner that you don't even have to think about it other than to load paper and ink occasionally.In other words:  just print or scan my freakin' document and let me get on with my life already.  Stop nagging me, stop making so much noise, and stop being so high maintenance.  We want to use our printers and move on to the next task, not babysit them day in and day out.",0,0

RTQ4S7JJBHYXQ,"The only good feature of this pencil is the ""bayonet"" style of the sleeve to hide the tip for protection.  Other than that, it's not even the best uni pencil at this price point (roulette), and it's not even as good as the cheap version of the kuru toga (cheaper version of the roulette).  At the same price there is the graphgear 1000 by pentel, which is a phenomenal drafting pencil with an even better way of protecting the tip.  Even cheaper are pencils like the Alvin draftmatic, which are far better, albeit with no way to protect the tip.A lot of reviewers on here buy pencils because of the way they look. I couldn't care less how a pencil looks. I spend my days doing complex mathematics and drafting schematics in mechanical engineering classes, and my pencils need to work for hours and hours and hours without issue.  This pencil simply doesn't. It's too light, which affects how easy it is to aim (for lack of a better word), and it feels cheap as a result of being too light. The weight that it does have is all towards the point, which is worse than being too light.  Worse than that, the lead breaks constantly.  I carried this pencil with me for one day, and it has sat on the shelf ever since.  If you were looking at buying this pencil, keep looking.",0,0

R15AU5JMD9B144,"I would not waste your time buying this printer. First time using it the printer ink would not dry. It would literally wipe right off the page. After leaving a different page out for 4 days to see if it just needed time it still did the same thing. We reached out to Amazon and was told they could not help us and to contact pantum. We contacted them and went back and forth with them for THREE WEEKS providing pictures/videos and explaining the printer was broken. We requested a new toner cartridge, refund, or a new printer be sent. They eventually told us they could not help us and we needed to contact Amazon again. We contacted Amazon and was given a return label to send it back but it needed to packaged due to it being over the 30 days. Now we are stuck finding a box or paying $30 to ship it back. Very frustrating since the printer had such great reviews but they failed to offer any sort help in our situation.

R3IXQIF867X5EY,"I purchased this item based on other positive or ok reviews on amazon.  The machine fit (mentioned as a problem with other aftermarket toners) was fine.  Molding is proffessional and installation is as easy as the factory canon toner.  The print quality however is horrible.  I was never that excited about the print quality of this canon printer to begin even considering it is a B&W laser.  The printer struggles with any grey tones and cannot handle B&W images well at all.  The saving grace for this printer however was text and line based documents in pure black were fast and very sharp.  Well that single positive attribute for this printer is now gone.  This replacement toner means my Canon MF 3010 can no longer print line and text B&W well. Everything is washed out, almost looking like I am using an old inkjet cartridge printer that is perilously low on toner.  Print quality is so unacceptable I cannot even use this to send out text based invoices to customers for my home based business.Don't buy this toner.",0,0

R1WGNH90CGXBTU,"I'm a fan, or was, of Brother printers. I also have a smaller B/W laser and a small color laser.New out of the box, the Brother Printer MFC8710DW worked flawlessly. The scanning to PC interface is a little clunky, but it works,Our first unit lasted a year. In that time it would have intermittent jams, more than any other printer we have owned, but not a deal breaker. A little after a year it started to jam 95% of the time, We cleaned the rollers, checked for foreign objects, but all to no avail. We made the mistake of buying an identical unit, thinking it would be simpler than removing the drivers on all 5 PCs and installing new drivers. Sadly this new printer also had a high occurrence of printer jams, then 6 months in to owning this new printer, the fuser failed - images would be blurry after they passed through the fuser unit. A call to tech support (Indian call center) had me run some basic tests and fax the blurry paper to them. They promised to call back, and haven't to date (48 hours later).I bought a Canon all in one laser and replaced all the print drivers. No more paper jams, and a much nicer scan to desktop feature. The replacement has a smaller footprint too. I bought the Brother Printer MFC8710DW thinking its rating for high print jus per month would mean it was very reliable, it wasn't. I've given up on the Brother Printer MFC8710DW. Depending on how well the Canon performs, I may just give up on Brother altogether...",0,0
R1KHZGGCDZWISO,"1. Not all holes are pre-drilled. The instructions say you don't need them but you're drilling by hand into wood (instructions say many times not to use a drill). It's not an easy process.2. The holes and grooves that are pre-drilled/cut aren't always aligned correctly. If you align the sides of the drawer so they're flush on the bottom, the grooves don't always line up. If you align the grooves, the sides of the drawers are visible from the front of the chest when assembled. What's more, many of the pre-drilled holes on the side of the drawers are too close to the surface of the front of the drawer. I didn't notice this until it was too late and popped a good section of the wood out. (see pic)3. The wood is quite soft and easily dented/scratched - while we were careful removing pieces from the box, we noticed scratches and dents immediately.4.

R92CFTNJCP6CD,"Most of the reviews here were near the time of purchase. This review is based on 11 months of ownership. The good part is that the seat section is well made and sturdy. The bad part is that the base is terrible, I'm up to my third hydraulic post. Its not that it wont function, its that its of shoddy quality and literally breaks and separates into two parts. When I contacted Comfort Products, they had to send out the post, the seat base and the star (part w/wheels). Each time the chair was unusable for 2-3 weeks. Then I had one time that I thought the wheels were sticking, so I called and was sent a set of wheels. When I flipped it over, I found two of welds had cracked. So I had to contact Comfort Products again and they had to send out the post, the seat base and the star (part w/wheels) again. fyi, once the parts are compressed they don't come apart. So even though its rated by them to handle up to 400 lbs and the use time is 40 hours a week, its not. It comes with a 1 year warranty. Hopefully this last of parts lasts, because after its out of warranty and its heading to the trash.Update: 3/18/2017; Still have chair.

R69A73A45JS7G,"I purchased this planner based on the reviews that I had read online.  I rarely post a review, but wanted others to know about this planner before their purchase.The pages of the planner are thin,  the printing shows through on the other sides of the pages.  I have just been using a regular ball point pen and the writing shows through as well.The monthly calendar is on one page and the boxes are small.  If you have a lot going on that you would like to see at a glance, it is difficult to get it all in.  The calendar arrived with a ""bump"" like it was laying on top of something that makes the pages not lay flat, I am guessing that they will flatten out over time.The pluses - I like the idea of the ""Action"" portion of each month, not sure if I would actually use the sections as they are designed but it is a nice way to plan out goals and To Do's for the month.  The weekly spread is nice, and I like the dotted grid to make lists etc.  The coils seem secure and the  cover is protected by a vinyl attached sheet.I purchased this planner because I had gotten a cheap one at Home Goods which was falling apart after one month of use.

But since I was mostly using it for documents it was fine.Then you find out the color ink is terribly overpriced and runs out quickly.

I bought this printer from Wal-Mart, took it home and immediately jammed when I tried to print the test page. I removed the jam and continued trying to get this printer to work. Paper jam after paper jam. I became so frustrated I called hp tech support they had me try a few steps I had already gone through myself  before coming to the conclusion that it must be a defective printer. They said they would send me a new one in the mail and I would return the defective one. But it wouldn't be the same one it would be refurbished.A few days later our new printer came in, not only was it refurbished... but it was a model older. I paid for a brand new printer that didn't work and the sent me an older used model. And yes the first printer was under warranty.I was hopeful that this new printer would work fine seems how on the phone with hp the man told me the refurbished printers were ""extensively tested."" When I took it out of the box and started the set-up, it didn't feel well put together at all. Nothing was tightly put together, everything rattled and just felt a little loose, such as the paper tray and the scanner lid. When I got to the test page, again this printer ate up the paper and jammed just like the last one. I tried a few more times and decided I had enough, I wasn't about to go through all that I did with the first one.I got the hp over a Cannon because they were a bit cheaper and we have an hp laptop that works great. But they clearly do not put the same quality into their printers.I returned both of the printers and paid the extra for the Cannon and love it. Prints smoothly, no jams, good quality, and wireless.

So found one that seemed to suit my needs, read some reviews and ordered it.Package arrived and I immediately began assembling it.All items needed to assemble the product were in number coded packets and the instructions were super straight forward.Started the assembly process and lo and behold! One of the screws that is supposed to connect the height adjustment bar to the bar that supports the table is too short and doesnt fit through the holes all the way. After 30 minutes of thinking I'm doing something wrong, I realize no, it's the screw! Yes, I can go to the hardware store and purchase another, longer screw. Yes, I can return the entire thing. Yes, I can contact the seller. None of those options seemed worth the hassle so out came the clamps to force shut the gap between the metal brackets that the screw must pass through. Great! That's done!Let's move onto assembling the rest! Time to put the wheels on! Get the base ready and go to screw in the wheels. 2 went in without any resistance...the other two? I think I gave myself carpal tunnel syndrome. So half way in and I remember that the package included a mini wrench! Grab the wrench and....the wrench is literally a quarter of a centimeter in thickness. The nut is also only a quarter of an centimeter in thickness...getting the wrench to grab hold of the nut was an entire other feat! Finally have the wheels placed and ready to use my new table!I move it to the location it will live in for the remainder of WFH, place my laptop on it, and give it a test run. I adjust the height so it's about 5 inches from my lap and I'm about 10 minutes, the table was literally on my lap. It doesnt stay in place! I thought maybe I didnt tighten it enough. I give all the knobs a good turn and notice one of the knobs doesnt even fit into the hole they're supposed to go into!

RD1TE5K8STNQD,"The fuser roller went bad, just like many other reviewers have mentioned.  Mine initially lasted about 9 months.  Brother sent a (remanufactured) replacement unit.  Now, 15 months later, the replacement fuser unit has failed.  The black coating on the roller splits open, exposing the red rubber underneath, which then crumbles and disintegrates.  It is clearly a manufacturing or design defect.  My printer is only used sparingly, maybe 20-30 pages per week.  It appears that the material they chose for this black coating cannot withstand the fuser heat for more than a few months.My guess is that the ""5 star"" ratings are all coming from people who have had the printer for only a couple of months and they are very happy with all the features, just like I was.  It seemed like a great printer for the price.  But, after a few more months, when your fuser is toast, the printer is out of warranty, and now have a boat anchor, you'll be regretting your purchase.

What really gets me is that theres enough people that have this problem for it to be clearly visible to the higher ups, and some executives at the company actually made the decision that they would trade 75 cents in screws for the loss of their company name.  And If the guys running the PALM company are idiots, then it's time to look elsewhere.I can't believe they wouldn't just ship out replacements and try to fix the product designs.  But as I reseacrch the net to try and find some decent replacement screws for my own unit in the meantime, I just keep finding more and more stories of good people (who don't have problems with screws coming out of other small electronics btw) who are in the same pathetic PALM ownership boat as me.  Am I ever sorry I bought the unit.  Besides the screws, it has reset on me on a number of occasions and luckily I'm religious about backing up data.  Still, you lose some entries and its a major pain.  In fact, I did miss a meeting once because I missed  reentering it after the unit reset and lost data.Well Palm won't be fattening their margins on me anymore, and I hope you heed the warning I give.  I am in the market for a new Handheld, but I'll NEVER allow myself to get swindled by them again.  They could've used the problem as an opportunity to show their customers that they do value us and score some points.  Unfortunately for them and for us customers, the cold response I've gotten from them tells me that they really could care less and do not have a long term outlook on what it means to sell a business product as important as a scheduling device.  It's best to stay away from them.  I'm through giving PALM any more business.  If you find a better company, please do share.",1,1

I just print things at home, a couple tax returns might be the biggest jobs. I have used 4 of these in 1 year which is ridiculous.

R2G4IGRD8WY0YQ,"This printers software is terrible. I have had to talk to HP support five times and over four hours because the wireless wizard is for naught when printed to put in the password, I’m told the security protocol is wrong, which is false. Two different techs have had to remotely take control and override the software and perform commands (which might as well be a foreign language toMe) to connect with my network. We are very busy business owners and didn’t open pkg until after 30 days. I read all the reviews but don’t remember reading about this problem. For all intent the machine is useless to me. I tried downloading from the website and downloading took forever until I tried Chrome instead of safari. Wizard via CD wasn’t successful either. Called support (read above) and wizard didn’t work for support representatives either. So another program was downloaded and after 11/2 hours connected. Next day, printer not connected to WiFi. Called support went thru process again. This morning same story and I don’t have another 90 minutes to go thru this process again.  I cannot call HP every time I want to print. I just wished I opened package sooner and I would have returned it. But maybe another Samsung printer would do same thing(?). Thoroughly disgusted. I’m no sure where the problem is -within the software, what else could it be? I’m so frustrated that I could sit firm and cry. HP support has been very nice but I’ve list over 10 hours just trying to get the wireless working properly. This morning trying on my own, spent over an hour and nothing. Very very unhappy and at a loss. The blue notes in the picture are instructions to set up going thru back door but even if I can figure out how to do this, I cannot afford the time to do this EVERY DAY. Maybe because my computer is a Mac???????Update:9.7.18. I have spent 5/12 hrs on the phone with HP support. And 9 phone calls. I like the printer but it just will not hold the IP configuration & goes offline. It still does will not connect using the wireless wizard. Each time a rep has configured the printer from the web access but the computer loses the up for no apparent reason. Two days ago. We thought it was fixed, permanently, but when I printed from the mobile app, the printer was out of paper and the printer was disconnected AGAIN. 11/2 hours on phone, again! I believe the printer is faulty but my fault, we are extremely busy, and I didn’t open it until after 30 days. The reviews were good so I trusted that the printer would not be defective. Now I have to return the printer to factory for analysis. Originally. HP said they would send a repair to my house. So I’ll be without a printer for ???? They are sending by email the return label, with a tracking number but they wanted be to call UPS and I said no because been there, done that, a complete hassle so we will see what happens. I will say HP support has been especially awesome with call backs and diligence.",0,0

R3ULOTTWI07DLG,"The  Parker IM Black Gold Trim Fountain Pen, Medium Nib - 1760800  is  a nice looking Parker pen which arrives in a soft box containing a single cartridge and warranty.  If there's a problem with the pen,  Parker requires a copy of your sales order because Amazon does not stamp the date of purchase on the warranty.  With this pen, use of the warranty is likely.  I'd read reviews abound with complaints regarding the faulty ink flow to the nib and the one I received is awful.  I'd also purchased an ink converter, so I know it's not the cartridge, as I've tried about a half dozen different inks.  With each, even if I leave the pen for an hour, it dries and I must either prime the converter or dip the nib into water or ink.  I was embarrassed at a meeting when the pen would not write and  I needed to sign a document.  Visually, this pen is five star.  In the hand, it's also five star.  If it worked properly, it would be a total five star value.  Unfortunately, a pen that doesn't write is worthless unless you've purchased it for another purpose.  I purchase pens to use as a tool for transporting ink to paper, so this one is a great disappointment.  I'd had a very old Parker fountain pen stolen inside of a bag and really wanted another, but this one will not replace the great pen I'd had for about forty years.  I cannot recommend this pen, particularly since there are so many really good fountain pens available currently.",0,0

We ended up using screws from our old stools...but they still don't work and the stools are very unstable.

R2EEJGSJDKCOQX,"I have used a Palm TX for several years and love it.  This past February my touchscreen began to act up and since I am an accountant, I desperately needed a reliable one.  So I came on Amazon and ordered a refurbished one from this provider.  At first I was pleased because it worked wonderfully!  Then about 2 months ago, I started having trouble with the battery.  I tried re-setting my Palm several times, draining the battery and then recharging.  Nothing worked, so I called the customer service from this provider.  Instead of being nice and helpful, I immediately got chewed out for not having posted a review before now and that the only reason I called was because something went wrong!  Then he immediately said I can't help you, it's out of warranty.  That was it!  He did suggest that I turn off the bluetooth, because it was probably draining it.  Since I had never had that problem with my other palm, I don't think that was it.  My husband took it into a local battery shop and when they opened it, they discovered that the original battery had never been changed out, even though I was sold a refurbished TX that was supposed to have a new screen and new battery in it.  So much for truth in advertising.  So, in the end I highly recommend the Palm TX, they are wonderful;  however, buy it from someone else besides these guys.So sir, here is your review.  Be careful what you ask for.  DO NOT do business with these guys, they don't follow through on their promises and they are not very helpful.",0,0

R8ENJ1OK9VDLM,"I am an elementary school teacher, and I thought that these Dr. Seuss Valentines would be perfect for my students. At $14.97, I also thought that they would be substantial. As I wasn't able to see what an individual card looked like, I thought that for $14.97 the cards would be small individual cards in separate envelopes. In the least I expected to get a high quality, glossy card (even without an envelope) to give to the kids.What came in the box was described best by one of my fellow teachers who said that the Valentines looked as if they came from the Dollar Store. They truly are no better than cards purchased at the Dollar Store. For $14.97 they are cheap, tear-part cards...the cards that didn't even fold over. I'm not sure if it is Paper Magic who has grossly overpriced this item or if it a royalty issue with the estate of 'Dr. Seuss.' Either way, someone is making a lot of money off of this, and it really is shameful.After thinking about it I decided not to give these to my students.

R2LIUIFL59BY4J,"I wanted to love this item and was incredibly disappointed when it arrived broken in multiple pieces. Out of the hundreds of items I've purchased from Amazon over the years, this will mark the first time I've ever requested to return an item for a refund rather than an exchange.Here's what's great about this item: The design is ingenious, the layout maximizes use of space and is ergonomically efficient by allowing frequently accessed items to be readily available. It places everything you need throughout a normal course of day spent conducting business right at your fingertips. This makes for a clean and functional workspace.However, brilliant design is worthless without equitable material...I agree with a comment by a previous reviewer, who stated ""The price is just too high to excuse poor quality."" Even if this hadn't arrived shattered in several pieces, I would not have been impressed as a result of its substandard material and lack of quality control.The plastic is incredibly thin and flimsy. (I included a picture depicting how it's barely thicker than a nickel.) It feels cheap and is reminiscent of product shipping material. Really, it reminds me of the containers used by Starbucks for salads and yogurt parfaits... Which is great for disposable containers but certainly no where near where where it should be for a fixed organizer that is to be displayed next to expensive technology.I must address the extent to which this item arrived damaged...... It wasn't just a few little scratches or chip... It arrived in 7 individually shattered parts. As the external box was fully intact, I do not believe the damage was incurred during shipping. When I opened the external shipping box, I observed that the internal (product) box was torn open. One of the plastic chunks was floating outside of it. To determine if I wanted a replacement, I arranged the pieces together in order to gauge how it functions when undamaged. Here's the kicker:The broken parts did NOT create a whole unit! There were missing peices! This leads me to conclude that it was damaged to the extend in which it was unusable PRIOR to being shipped. Did this vendor knowingly sent out an unusable item in hope that it could turn a profit? Perhaps it's a numbers game? Maybe the majority of people won't go through the hassle of returning products in this price range, so they continue to capture profit off damaged inventory...? I hope that's not the case because that's the epiphany of SCANDALOUS business practices! ... But at the very least, the facts hint at this being a possibility...",0,0

R2OH8TPE0UYHTC,"I was excited by this purchase and thought I had done my research. Reviews stated that it was easy to set up and worked right out of the box. That was not my experience. The printer was returned after four hours of attempting to install and troubleshoot; two of those four hours were with an HP tech remoting my desktop as we both worked to fix whatever connectivity issue the printer had. He could not solve the problem.Highlights:1. Needing to use USB connection to set up wireless printing. Why? The whole point is that it's wireless, yes? Anyway, I did not look forward to completing the same wired install on every device in my house.2. After installing program I was unable to ""find"" the printer, mostly because it kept turning itself off. Repeatedly. In fact it wouldn't stay on, and sometimes it was on when the power light was off, but sometimes not. So...absolutely no  way to indicate if the thing was on or off.3.  In attempting to locate troubleshooting information I suddenly, and angrily, realized that this is an HP product. That's my mistake. I did not realize that HP had purchased Samsung. I bought the Samsung to replace an HP product that decided to not connect to anything (despite all signs saying it was connected, and no changes to system or network) after a year and a half of light use printing. I plan on taking the old printer into the yard and ""Office Spacing"" it with a baseball bat since no one at HP seems able to help me. So, new printer...and hey, surprise, I accidentally fell right back into the HP trap. HP computers are okay. HP printers are flimsy unsupported crap.4. Install did not recognize the serial number on its own product. So, that's a thing. I don't know what it means, but it's a thing. And it happened. Troubleshooting on HP website also did not recognize the serial number and provided limited information without it. Does this mean it is a fake? I have no idea.5. Took about an hour for me to give up and get in touch with HP customer service. Surprise! The phone lines are closed on the weekends, and the troubleshooter is useless AF.6. FINALLY got through to customer service on chat. Thankfully the tech on duty didn't treat me like an idiot (this happens). We ran down the list of things I had already tried, and I begrudgingly decided to allow him remote access to my computer. I hate having to resort to this. Hate it!7. Spent two hours fidgeting with settings, getting frustrated with the automatic turn off. Finally it printed a test page while connected to desktop with  USB, but we could not discover the problem with wireless. The printer is NO USE to me as a wired printer.8. After four total hours of trying to get the printer to do its one job,  print wirelessly, we gave up. The tech didn't know what to do next, so I thanked him and said I was done. I uninstalled, fixed the settings we had changed, and went to return.9. The irony of needing to print a return label for a printer is worthy of note. I sent it to a friend and asked him to print it.I am not amused. Attempting to get this stupid printer to work on a HP desktop running Win10 was ridiculous. I lost 4 hours of my life, and a trip to the UPS store and back to return it to Amazon. Now I have to go find another option and am printerless again.",0,0

R290QAD503K69Q,"I purchased a Macbook for my daughter as a Christmas gift In December 2010 from the local Apple store. The sales person informed me that for an extra $50 we could also get the HP B210 printer. That sounded like a good enough deal at the time so we went for it. My daughter lives 300 miles away so we dropped it off at her apartment before Christmas. Since then, my daughter has made a few dozen prints with this machine with great difficulty. Each time she prints, she must remove and re-install the printer software. In one case the document she was trying to print came out a week later??? HP online support was not helpful in solving her problem. When she finally informed me of the problems she was having, I checked out the Amazon customer reviews. It is now clear to me that this is a flawed and failed product line from HP. Due to the logistics of getting the printer back from 300 miles away, I decided not to worry about taking it back to Apple (I don't want another one anyway). I just told my daughter to go out and get an EPSON and she can send the HP to the nearest landfill - something it is much more suited for. I used to be a loyal HP customer. I'll never buy another.

R14BU5OR7GFQFT,"Hi - I'm a network engineer and I work with enterprise hardware on a daily basis.  This is an excellent printer, hardware-wise.  But what I will suggest is you DO NOT BUY THIS PRINTER.  I bought this printer based on all of the positive reviews, but they must be mostly fake because this company Samsung is completely incompetent, their software is full of bugs, it does not work.  I spent 5 hours trying to get this printer online and get it to work and every single option created an error message. This is the worst garbage software I have ever seen on a printer in my life. This software DOES NOT WORK and has bugs. I troubleshooted for hours on things that should have worked but nothing did and I could not get the wireless working.  Finally after giving up I contacted Samsuck customer support and got someone in India.  This person gave me the login for the printer under the Smart Sync menu and that finally allowed me to simply connect the built in hotspot to my Wifi 2.4 network.  This software is GARBAGE.  First of all there are 5 different applications, why? Secondly there are multiple drivers and utilities, why?  Third simply trying to add the printer in Windows doesnt work, it asks you for a PIN and tells you its on the printer, but its nowhere on the printer.  It is actually in the Test Print configuration information.  And then the PIN still doesnt work and the printer wont connect to the Direct WIFI.  The only way to connect is to connect manually by clicking the Samsung Wifi Direct wireless hotspot and then using the PIN as a password, at this point you can gain access to the default 192.168.3.1 direct WIFI URL and then get inside and change the IP address and settings by hand.  Wifi PIN to router also doesnt work. The kicker is that even though I got the printer to connect over wifi , the apps still did not see the driver as active and still didn't see the printer as active. Unreal, laughable programming!  A 14 year old could write a better app, its very sad.  Lastly the app has buggy error messages due to poor lazy debugging. Whoever wrote this software should be immediately fired and the entire Samsung print software needs to be rewritten from scratch, what a joke!. Next time I will buy a Brother. The funny thing is I knew this would be a problem because Samsung software is awful but I was stupid and made the purchase anyway full well knowing I would have a headache.",0,0

RV2OOCVLOGW59,"I've never seen a more deceptive photo on Amazon. I had no illusions about receiving a piece of furniture--merely a functional paper-sorter that would sit on the rear of my desktop and prevent the constant slippage of pens, pencils, remote controls, iPods, CD cases, documents, from the back edge of the desk to behind the steam radiator.  I expected some sort of ""slowly perishable"" thin particle wood board, plastic, or cardboard so durably constructed it would obviate the need for synthetic alternatives.I was hardly prepared for what I received.  The thinnest, flimsiest cardboard imaginable, perhaps seeming all the more like a slap in the face because many of the products that arrive through Amazon Prime at a fraction of the price of this object are packaged in cardboard that is twice as thick and durable as this ""Fellowes Compartment Literature Sorter.""  Anyone walking into my office and seeing this silly box on my desk would laugh out loud, and I'd deserve every last derisive chuckle.This thing is almost too flimsy to return.  A ""paper paper-sorter"" is what it is.  It reminds me of the sacrifices we as Americans made during and shortly after World War II when, instead of toy trains made of metal, we received toy trains made of paper.  We cut them out of books, didn't complain, and felt we'd been well served.  In this case, quite the contrary is true: the customer is completely s....d.  The feeling is not totally unlike that of being on the wrong end of an extortion scheme.I was, in part, ""taken"" because of a misguided faith in the alleged manufacturer, ""Fellowes.""  Perhaps they deserve some credit for the design but zero for the constituent material and functionality. This is mere 3rd-rate generic cardboard sold by an outfit very close to my digs and importing worthless cardboard all the way from China.  If it were five bucks, I could simply toss it.  It wouldn't even be deemed an article Salvation Army might sell for a few cents.  But for the price I paid, the only reasonable course of action is to try for a refund and, at the very least, make Amazon as well as you, the prospective victim, aware of the discrepancy between the appearance and the reality.  (Recommendation: 1. Put a bit more trust in things sold directly by Amazon; 2. Look for wood or plastic in the description of the constituent material; 3. Check out some of the similar products--especially if its for your personal desktop--made by Safco (and sold directly by Amazon).",0,0

R1A8VXOSEEKW5X,"Let me start by saying that this product has the impressive distinction of being so bad that I felt a moral obligation to write this review IMMEDIATELY after installing it. I'll also say that I have the full suite of the next level racing GT products that it attaches to, and that, while they aren't perfect, I am a very big fan. The real tragedy about this thing is that it's mostly well built. The whole thing would work fine if not for one unbelievably stupid, inexplicable design decision. That being the way the tray attaches to the arm. The tray is essentially welded to a conical tube that slides over the conical tube connected to the arm. Here's the thing, only the exterior tube is drilled through and you are given a flathead screw and, no tools that fit it, to secure the thing. The result is that the tray flops left and right (as in on the Z-axis) with the lightest touch. As you can imagine a keyboard tray that won't support the weight of a keyboard, or a controller or much else without destabilizing entirely, is basically a paperweight. To you guys at next level racing, please feel free to justify yourselves. I am anxious to hear why you couldn't say... through-bolt the inner tube, or just use a square bracket like the rest of the arm. I'm not an engineer and that took me about 30 seconds to think up and would have cost you virtually nothing. This product would be an insult with a $10.00 price tag. At $80.00, you guys need to go home and apologize to your parents for letting them down.",0,0

They are also incredibly stiff and the adhesive is mediocre, so they don’t want to stick to anything that isn’t flat and smooth, and many of them have been die cut straight through the backing, so I have to wrestle them off the pages.

R2IJPMS5BWGFQQ,"1st of all, The palm TX has alot of good features, I actually liked it, not having any problems for the first 4 months. After that though is when the nightmares started.  The on off switch started going bad, the palm kept on crashing, and the 3.5 mm earphone jack went out.  I called Palm support, the call is forwarded to a call center in India, after talking and argueing for 4 days, speaking to about 8 different people and 3 different supervisors, all telling me different things, I finally got the authorization to get my palm sent in.  Well about 2 weeks later it came back... different device, all the programs i purchased for it didnt work on it... well about 3 weeks later the same problem occured with the palm.  The earphone Jack went out.  The same problem with both devices.  Well i had to start the procedure over again, calling palm, by this time they are disgusted with me, because i dont back down. I want to know every detail, seeing i work in customer service, and i have to deal with alot of othe companies for my work. I got no help and they told me to call Corporate.  Well this didnt go so hot either....

R6GLVICHTOEEP,"I am 6'4"" and 240 lbs.  I am surprised to read other reviews that mentioned the chair handled any weight.  I guess the upper part of the chair seems to be fine with weight.  And it rolls around just fine until I sit down.  Then it has a lot of trouble rolling.  3 of the wheels broke off within a month of use due to the difficulty rolling.  I don't think the wheels are low quality, I just think they are not built to handle sideways stress.  I have replaced the wheels with the best ones I could find.  So far they have lasted a bit longer, but they still won't roll correctly under stress.  With minimum experimentation, it is clear the chair base cannot handle the weight correctly.Pros:  Chair is attractive and comfy.  The tilt controls work just fine.  The headrest is a nice addition and hard to find anymore.  The price is good.Cons:  Weight problem mentioned above.  The chair arms are flat metal.

R3DIIZ4TZJ3E06,"This is so bad that I need to write a review so people stop wasting money on this and go for one of the other stands (I have 3 different stands from Amazon). I had two foldable book holders from the Harvard bookstore years ago which were amazing, even for heavy, overpriced physics books with atrociously short shelf lives (I've since found the stands on Amazon- ""Mighty Bright fold-n-stow""). Sadly, they got lost at some point. I bought this Fellowes stand as an add-on from Amazon. BEWARE! This thing simply isn't designed to hold heavy, or even normal books- the foldable prongs are just too close together for this stand to bear any significant weight. I ended up shelling out the money and bought one $10 Mighty Bright, as well as an $15 Actto book holder from Amazon. The Actto takes up a little more space in my bag, but it really is worth it, even better than the Mighty Bright. Well built and as I write this review it's propping open a hefty, 900 page, hardback, 9 x 12 science textbook. I read elsewhere that the Fellowes stand has been around for some 35 years... to my knowledge, books were just as thick/heavy back then, so I don't know how it managed to sell before the age of the tablet (which is all this stand is good for). BOTTOM LINE: This cheap stand is exactly that. If you're looking for a BOOK holder, skip this one and spend a bit more on a stand that's worth it!!!",0,0

R39P2L6R8MRADQ,"I bought this printer after a decent amount of research done by myself, consumer reports, and different printer spokesmen that come to retailers to talk up their products from their specific companies.  Also conducted many investigative research with long-time employees from different retailers who know their printer stuff.  The general consensus was that with the Lexmark Pinnacle Pro 901, you pay a decent amount up front, but the money saved over time with the market leading low cost black ink cartridges is greater.  Wasn't looking for a great color printer, as we almost always print black ink only documents. Also obviously wanted the wireless technology, among other new common technologies that come with all-in-one printers.  Great. Sold.After a week of moderate black ink printing, a page comes out LITERALLY DRENCHED with blue ink (cyan cartridge).  Being objective, I went through all the common solutions that may attribute to the problem.  No solutions were listed on the Lexmark website for this issue, which is amazing considering the amount of attention this particular problem as garnered with this particular printer.  I checked to make sure the print-head was securely locked into place, and made sure the ink cartridges were locked into place.  Made sure the firmware was up to date.  Also followed the on-screen HELP feature to 'clean' and 'wipe' the print-head.  Tried again, same issue.  So much ink had bleed out that the inside of the printer had a film of cyan ink covering it.  A paper towel ROLL later, the mess was cleaned up, and I inserted a NEW cyan cartridge.  Same thing happened again.  I cleaned up the mess once more and unplugged the unit and opened it up (to hopefully let the ink dry up from parts unable to get to with towel to clean) for a week.  The next week i start it up and print a black document, and get blue streaks and block-like blotches and blue track marks everywhere.During my initial research of this printer, I had read a few reviewers who came across this problem.  At the time there were not that many reviews relating to this problem, so I chucked it up to isolated incidents.  A mere 2 months later as the date of this review, new research shows that this has now become an overwhelming issue with many Lexmark Pinnacle 901 users.  So much so that the replaceable print head for this product is unavailable and on back-order due to high demand for replacements.Took the printer to Best Buy (initial retailer of purchase) without the box and described the problem.  They gladly took it back and gave us the $200 in-store credit to choose a new printer.  Luckily a comparable HP model was on sale for $149.99 and even CAME WITH INK.  Sure the HP ink costs more, but I need not go through the pain of not having a printer and waiting on a replacement print-head to be made available and to possibly keep going through this problem.  The Lexmark Pinnacle 901 is NOW discontinued by the way, most likely due to this fast growing popular print-head problem.The new HP all-in-one offers all the same new technology, but also offers remote printing from cell phone, iPad, iPhone, or even office via the printer's personal e-mail address.  Very cool.  HP set up was much easier with the wireless networking and remote networking.  HP prints over wireless network much quicker than the Lexmark did.  HP starts wireless printing almost instantly, where the Lexmark Pinnacle 901 took a good 20-30 seconds before it activated from wireless print.I Think the Lexmark Pinnacle would have been a GREAT all-in-one wireless printer had it not been for the print head issues that has now overwhelmed the product and has now gotten itself discontinued.  Too bad.  Now HP reigns supreme in our home.",0,0
R2GZET7UPHMXBC,"Yes, the price of this high-yield toner can't be beat.  The question always is, do compatible toners really deliver on the amount of toner they are supposed to have?

It arrived on time in nicer than usual packaging and contained a nice note about  the business and family. Had there been an email address, this would have gone there first, instead of public. The box states the item was made in China but designed in Canada. Somewhere between the two there was the slightest of breakdowns. While I was unpacking the item, I had a momentary distraction and -thump- something hit my shoe. It was the roll of tape that comes with the unit. There's where the devil is in the details. The plastic spool tasked with holding the roll of tape doesn't. It so nearly almost does, then the roll of tape slips off.  I did not try the included roll of tape. The tape I use is heavier than most and I wrapped 5 turns of that around the slippery slightly smallish spool and loaded the reel. Taping the taper helped some and a proper application of duct tape will make the taper good as, make that better than new.

I especially liked the wireless connectivity and the scanner, where the original can be fed through a paper handler or laid on a flat screen.  I have only used the printer for month, so reliability is still unknown.  There are a few things that could be better.  The print cartridges are different than pictured in the installation drawings, and my printer had both old and new types.  As other reviewers have noted, when connected to the phone line the printer comes to life at every call and can make a fair amount of commotion doing so. In general the paper feed is noisy and cheap-sounding; it almost sounds like paper is jamming, but it's not.  When the printer first comes out of sleep mode it can take about 30 seconds for the first print job to start, but after that response is quick. All in all, I am very satisfied.After several months I am dropping my review from 5 stars to 3 stars.  I was getting less than 100 sheets per 100xl cartridge.

R30ONJ12X80DBM,"I give this two stars instead of one because the cordless phone and answering machine aspects of the product work fine. But the star feature of this model, the ""audio/visual doorbell answering system,"" fails completely.First, the camera has narrow angle of view. While some may argue that this reduces distortion of the visitor's face, it also makes it difficult to see who/what else is at the door. Second, the camera is black and white, and the resolution is very low, resulting in blurry and grainy images most of the time. The image is almost impossible to see when you have strong backlight, as is often the case in front of my front door, where the camera is located, throughout much of the day. Third, you cannot use the video mode unless the camera is hooked up to AC power; in my case this is difficult to achieve because I do not have an outlet outside of the door so I use two AA batteries for the camera unit, which means I cannot turn on the video mode from the handsets. (I have not tested the night vision aspect of the camera, as I do not get night visitors at all.)Another serious problem is, oftentimes, you have a significant delay between when the doorbell button is pressed and when you actually receive the image (and the accompanying doorbell sound) on the handset. This is frustrating in a funny way because I can hear the doorbell from the camera unit when someone presses the button, and when I pick up the handset, it takes a few seconds for the image and the ding-dong to appear on my handset. In the beginning, I often got startled by the second ding-dong bell, the one coming from the handset speaker. This is ridiculous because my handset is no more than 25 ft. away from the door. Why the communication delay???The doorbell control functions on the handset are ridiculously difficult to use. I read the instructions when I first got this from Amazon Vine for review. A couple of days later, when someone was really at the door and rang the bell, I actually couldn't figure out how to recall the image. Also, sometimes when I press on the handset buttons, they do not respond, or respond with a delay, kind of like using an Android phone.So in summary, this product, while looking attractive and having solid phone/answering machine functions, fails miserably as a doorbell monitor.",0,0
R2F0PDLO8JWFMY,"I last purchased the Iris weathertight boxes in 2017.  They latched well and were quite rugged.  Now, August 2021, I purchased another 4-pack of the containers.  THEY HAVE CHANGED!Now, in 2021, the plastic walls of the container are approximately one-half the thickness and the latches don't latch.  The latches flop open because the thin sidewalls of the container are bowed in and warped.Reviews here probably depend upon which era of construction you receive.  The old boxes were amazing - they were airtight and rugged and stayed latched when closed.  The new ones don't do ANY of those things.Iris U.S.A. Inc., I am begging you to return to the older construction of these items.  The new ones are useless.  By the way, the shipping container says ""Made in USA"".  I find this hard to believe.  The recent (low quality) containers seem suspiciously low China quality.  What gives?",0,0

R34CTDF0YDFX1K,I read many reviews looking for the strongest chair mat on Amazon. Ordered this one and was disappointed after two days of use. Installed it on short pile berber and it still dents.

R309SSK6404E2W,"When I first bought this printer and set it up, I thought it was amazing and completely worth it! But after about two months of using it, it's a complete piece of garbage. I probably thought it was awesome because it was a huge space saver on my desk and I loved the idea of printing wirelessly. If I could give this 0 stars, I would! Let me just jump right to point of why this printer sucks.1. Once it turns on, it takes forever to warm itself up. You have to wait minutes before the power light flashes than its ready to print.2. Every time you hit print, it always has to find the printer and connect to the printer which can sometimes take more than 2 minutes. And no, it's not my computer because I've had plenty other printers before that would just print off right away!3. If I'm printing 3+ pages, sometimes it'll print all 3 one after the other but most of the times, the printer just LOVES taking a break in between pages. One will print then it'll wait a minute before the 2nd prints and does it all over again. It's irritating!4. If you run out of paper during a print, there's no button you can press to tell it that's good to go after reloading and you just have to turn you printer off and back on. Sometimes doing that doesn't do anything at all! Even if I restarted my computer and the printer, the printer will keep saying that there's no paper, when there is paper in it!5. Majority of the times I can't print at all! Even with the USB cable plugged directly to my computer, it keeps saying the printer is not found. It's definitely not my computer because I've tried it on my brother and sisters as well.Every single time I absolutely needed something to be printed, this printer always failed me.Honestly, spend $40 more and go get yourself an HP1102 laser printer, you'll be a lot happier with that, it's much quieter and it prints way quicker than this piece of junk!",0,0

R35C3CFLHB6DWX,"I was really impressed with the Lexmark Pro901 after initial installation.  My printer was placed in service on Christmas Day, 2010, and worked great for about 3 months ...then noticed the print quality begin to deteriorate quite noticeably.  Now, it is September, 2011, and the only colors this pile of waste will print are gray and yellow.  After considerable time with Lexmark ""support"", discovered the problem lies with worn out print heads.  I am surprised because I would consider the amount of usage quite light (roughly 2 or three copies per day on average).The support person was from the Phillipines and had trouble understanding English to the extent that my wife had to spell words quite slowly and speak redundantly.  Bottom line:  this model is notorious for print heads going kaput rather quickly--among other things.  If you have one and can return it, by all means, do so since its functionality is on borrowed time.  The great functions and any semblance of print quality will degenerate faster than you can say, ""Over-hyped heap of junk with serious print issues"".  For the record, I have rarely bad-rapped any product in my reviews (for what it's worth).  I can't blame Amazon --they are simply the retailer.  Avoid!",0,0
R337SQY9FZJL6A,"I bought two of these from a local store. Each took several hours to assemble, what with the screwing into solid wood with no pilot holes and fixing the defective pieces. (The company has a way on their website to get replacement parts, but in the drop-down list of reasons, ""manufacturing defect"" isn't there. Apparently Adeptus can't conceive of the sloppy manufacturing they really do. I fixed the issues myself.)The first unit went together pretty well, but what you end up with is not quite as perfectly aligned, drawer-to-drawer, as the picture on the box shows. I can't imagine the additional time it would have taken to produce such a perfect result, since the pieces themselves are not precision made.There's one egregious error in the instructions. Copied directly from the 'assemble the small drawers' section, the 'assemble the large drawers' section says to line up the bottom edge of the drawer side with the bottom edge of the drawer front. Everyone who has built this knows this is wrong. You have to line up the drawer-bottom grooves instead.The second unit I built had (1) a screw that was missing its head, (2) one of the drawer sides had its holes countersunk on the wrong side, (3) another drawer side had its slot machined too shallow, such that the drawer wouldn't slide in the runner without a lot of force, (4) two of the four caster-insert holes were not wide enough to accept the inserts without a lot of trimming with a knife.Several pieces had cosmetic imperfections like dings and scrapes. The boxes the units came in were undamaged, so there's no doubt the pieces were packed that way at the factory. Two stars because when you're done you do get a usable, light-duty cabinet with drawers.",0,0

R2ZYGEXZWWS5UU,"11-26-2012 Update: Lexmark Pinnacle Pro901 All-in-One Printer is NOT compatible with Windows 8. Only some function accessible using hardwired USB connection. There are no drivers for this machine and Windows 8 insists that it is INCOMPATIBLE. This machine has NEVER been a suitable printer and I hate to trash it, but I will soon when I finish using all my ink supply.  GAD...don't even think of not using LEXMARK ink. It hardly works with LEXMARK ink, let alone try any other brand.  I would give it a MINUS 5 STARS, if there was such.Interestingly my Lexmark Optra E312L laser printer is still working like a champ; even with Windows 8 using USB. No problems for 13 years now, but then I don't use it heavily.6-1-2012. I purchased the Lexmark Pro901 because I've had good success with a prior Lexmark printer. I have a Lexmark Optra E312L laser printer that's 12 years old and still works great with never a failure.  The Pro901, however, has been troublesome for the six months I have had it.  The machine and printhead have both been replaced by Lexmark, although I believe only the printhead was failing, but they could not diagnose that.  Installation of the software has been a total nuisance and I have had to do it 15 times over the six months, as some features just quit working and reinstall is the only way to get them back operational.  I still can't get downloads from Lexmark site and multiple calls to the Technical support have not helped.  I'll keep tring to resolve the matter, as I've got 30 years of computer experience and can usually figure it out. When the machine works right, the results are great, but the ""when"" is problematic.  I've spent many hours ""fixing"" this machine so it works.  The replacement is still only partially operational.  The Lexmark Tech support has been very willing to help but since they seem to be in the Phillipines, communications are very limited, even with their ""remote"" login to try and diagnose the machine. Also, the ink cartridges seem to fail frequently.  I have yet to finish a set of ink cartridges without them failing. This is getting expensive.  Sorry, Lexmark, but your new technology ""sucks"".

R1A78LGFO0J1WB,"This is the third Palm I had over 7 years. The more advanced Palm gets the worse they get.Less than six months after I got my fancy new TX my digitizer went. I call this slick advanced company, right? Wrong! I get some girl who can't speak English and insists she does when I asked to be transfered to someone who I can communicate with. Finally, I sent it in under the year warranty. They sent it back with the digitizer fixed, but with a new problem. The on/off button doesn't work right. So I have a choice of shelling out for shipping again and managing without my Palm or turning it on with one of the other buttons and setting the automatic shut off. OK so what do you thing I choose? Then about a week after the year warranty was up it really went on the blink. Now I needed my on/off button to work so I can do a hard reset. Well I finally get it on a random time that it decided to work but that didn't help. Gradually it got worse and worse. Eventually about 14 months after I shelled out a hefty piece of change for this aggravation it totally died.I sympathize with those of you who are still used to the Palm system, but do yourself a big favor buy something from a different company!!!By the way I know a number of people who also had the TX and had major problems with it and gave up on Palm.One more thing.

I've had most of the same problems others have:- clogged print heads- takes a long time to print a black & white draft quality page over wifi at times (>3 minutes)- $5 black ink seems like a great deal but there's no way I get anywhere close to 500 pages.  Maybe 100, and I print mostly black and white and use ""draft"" quality to preserve ink.- Document feeder doesn't work at all for a standard 8.5x11 sized piece of paper.  Jams every time.

R2NMFM2IQRHJMJ,"My second review remains posted below (scroll down)I am now downgrading this from 4 stars to 2 stars. I really did like many of the features and the laser quality printing of this multi-use device. It has served as a back up to my inkjet printer, particularly for jobs that required laser quality printing. As such, it was used sparingly. I have had a problem recently in which the paper-pick up in the paper tray was not functioning. I went on-line and followed all the advice given but to no avail. I then took it to highly regarded print repair shop. Their diagnosis was a bad motor and the cost to repair this would be exhorbitant compared to the price of a new unit. When I compare this problem, previous issues and the cost to replace ink cartridges, I have decided to stick with ink-jet printers and have tossed my Samsung. It was good while it worked but the resulting cost per page was out of sight.Second Review: Solved my problem. My printer stopped printing and after some sleuthing, I found I needed a replacement for the waste toner container. This came as a complete surprise as the original failed after only 33% of the quoted life of the container. I have downgraded my original review for the CLX 3305 FW from 5 stars to 4.

As you can see, the one I received is NOT a peso back badge. I like the badge for what I wanted it for but just wish that sellers would not promote things to be something they are not. These are made in India and are clearly (from my pictures) not a peso back. So, if you are like me and it doesn't really matter, the badge seems well made and sturdy. If you are looking for more than that...it's not here. Gave it two stars because it works for me but the listing is misleading.",0,0
R2X1OURX00TB1I,"Based on a long history with Palm (back to 1996 and the original Palm) and good reviews for the TX both here and on CNET, I purchased the TX.  Four times I tried to install the software, four times it failed.  The culprit is a little subroutine called VMDialogWrapper.exe.  I looked on Google, and found 3 references to this problem, and tried the solution mentioned there, a neat little program put out by Microsoft called Windows Installer Cleanup.  Even that did not help.  I know from previoius experience with Palm that they will not service what they sell, except with gobs of money, so I am reluctantly returning this unit.  It looks like a great design, has the WiFi and Bluetooth I wanted, etc.  Were it not for the lousy little subroutine, I would happily rate this either 4 or 5 stars, but if it's DOA, then the rating has to be lower.  I hope others have more success, but for me, I'm moving to Windows Mobile.",0,0

R2ZE4GBEU99HZF,"From the First day I purchased this printer, I have had nothing but headaches.  It did work ok for about 6 months, but now it is just AWFUL.  The scanner works and saves only if you put a flash drive or SD card into the slot.  The printer head never recognizes the cartridges half the time.  The colors bleed together and the printer head has burned out 2 times in less than 18 months. ABSOLUTELY AVOID this printer.UPDATE Dec 2013. Did not even bother using the print functions of this printer for past 8 months. Now the scan function does not work. AND the top cover broke with very little use. Again absolutely AWFUL printer / all in one. Recommend to absolutely avoid.  Also the customer support is absolutely horrible. I called multiple times. The sent me one replacement ink holder to try to fix the ink problems, but still did not work.  I drop my rating to 1 star.",0,0
R2X9K7YG91RIV9,"I bought this compass at a local hardware store in Calais Maine.  It looks like a good compass in the package, all metal construction as another reviewer said.  But in reality, the construction is flimsy and sloppy.  The compass does not lock into position nor is the pinch spring strong enough to allow scribing against rough surfaces where extra pressure may be needed.  It's shape is not really conducive to accurate scribing either.  Yes, it draws circles, but most carpenters/woodworkers are looking for more than that.  Good buy for your kid in high school geometry, but I wouldn't go beyond that. I'm moving up to compass made from 3/8 solid steel bar stock.  Buy once, cry once.",0,0

R3ENJL83UHTTUS,"As I am writing this review, I am using this subpar ""adjustable"" desk... For over $50, it is not the best ""adjustable"" desk you can find. I'd say find a different desk or use tv trays.First off, the instructions were hard to understand mainly because the steps are all wrong in their order of building it. The drawings did not show certain angles of how screws were supposed to go in. I had to redo it several times with my husband because it should have been so easy to build but it was an absolute mess and headache.My biggest issue was the desk pillar. The rubber stoppers on the inside is supposed to prevent scratching on the top desk pillar BUT if they stay in, I couldn't insert the top part in. So I had to rip them out to insert the desk in but now they are scratching the pillars inside. POORLY MADE. Not only that, the pillar rock back in forth, about 1/4 of an inch difference. I had to insert a paperclip inside to keep it from rocking. Really??? For the final product, it was just sturdy enough so that you don't demand a refund. You can still use it but I would recommend getting rubber padding or some type of adhesive so your laptop does not fall off.The desk itself is very awkward to move around. The wheels are too tiny and it barely travels well enough on hardwood floor, let alone carpet. Sometimes it would get stuck and throw the desk off balace, so you are better with just carrying it instead.Although this desk is convenient enough, I wish I had either bought something nicer OR stick with a large tv tray.",0,0

When I try to resharpen them, the tip breaks off over and over and over until all the pencil is gone.

R124OAMPZ13636,"I spent hours on the wireless. Never got it working.

R3ASZAQ0DSRU0B,"The title of this review summarizes my experience with this printer. OK printer/scanner combo for the price, horrible experience trying to connect it via WiFi, and customer service is horrendous.Pros:-Great price specially compared to name brand printers out there that have risen in price astronomically and you'll end up paying and arm and a leg for their cartridges.-Prints/scans relatively fast with decent quality.Cons:-If you're not computer savvy, you're going to have a hard time figuring how to set this up. So, I'll leave a short Mac Tutorial here to help you out:-Ignore the instructions and do the following.-Go to Pantum's website, search appropriate model for Mac iOS, and download the driver and install it on your Mac.-Once installed, turn on the printer and connect it to your Mac via the USB cable provided.-Go to system preferences>>Printers&Scanners>>Hit the + sign>>Choose the printer that shows up and run through prompts till the printer is added.-Now, disconnect the USB cable, go to Launchpad, find Pantum folder and run the Wireless Configuration Tool.-That's it! Now you're wirelessly connected to your Mac.-If you want to print/scan from other iOS devices such as your iPhone, go to App Store and install Pantum Scanner app. Go to find printer on top of the app and you should be able to see the printer, as long as your iPhone and Printer are on the same WiFi network.Now, here's where the poor customer service kicks in. There's no scan manager allowing you to scan from your Mac and when you call customer service, they will tell you the only way to scan is via USB connection, which is completely false. Here's how you can wirelessly scan from your Mac.Go to Printer/Scanner in System preferences, find your printer, on the right hand side you'll see a toggle for print/scan. Move it to scanner and Mac's native scanner app will open up. Hit scan and you can scan documents wirelessly.As you can see, none of this is straight forward, specially if you're not computer savvy and you're going to rely on Pantum's poor customer service.",0,0

R33XBKKYBM8PP3,"I found this blackboard to be way too reflective and it was too hard to read any writing on it. The markers are not bold colored and look dull and drab especially if you are standing a distance away or at an angle. They really only look OK when you stand directly in front of the board. The board itself is not very attractive looking and stood out like a sore thumb in my kitchen. It just didn't fit in.If you stand at certain angles in relation to the board you can't read anything due to all the glare from ambient light sources.  Sometimes it is more like writing on a mirror than a blackboard. I will be returning this for a refund. Very disappointed.Perhaps this blackboard would work better in a darker room and with different markers, and that's why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1. You can also cut the magnetic board material down to whatever size or shape you want. It's soft and flexible. You could just use scissors to do it.I should mention that this is my first experience with chalk markers and I have no idea if it is normal for them to appear dull in color until you stand directly in front of the board.

R3Q3Z7DOTL058S,"PROs:- Prints volumes relatively quickly.- Easy double-sided printing- Having a home photocopier is not only convenient but apparently safer in regards to identity theft.  Apparently thieves will take out the memories of scrapped photocopiers to sift through for personal information.- Can manage thick papers, such as 80-100lb cover weight papers.  This is nice for both business and things like crafting.CONs:- Finicky.  Sometimes it chooses not to print documents.  Just because.  I send the document to the ancient HP and then it starts printing - what gives.- Intrusive.  Lexmark is always asking me to install software.  It is just a printer - its job is to print.  As far as I can tell it shouldn't need schmancy software updates to print out reports and pictures.  I've always refused the update requests and still get it to print 9.95 times out of 10, so they aren't even necessary.  It also has a large popup window telling you its progress in printing.  This is incredibly annoying, especially when I'm working in Photoshop and have to minimize the window which insists on blocking my layers window and interrupts my workflow.  Lexmark...I know what your progress in printing is...I just have to turn my head to see how far the paper is sticking out.  It's a completely useless feature to make a piece of basic office equipment seem more relevant and high-tech than it really is.- Color printing developed striations within a month.  I cleaned the cartridges and the issues started showing up when it was still new, so I figure this is just a flaw in the machine's design.  I don't print photos, so I don't know if this will affect home photo printing.  The striations are highly noticeable but not unbearable.  Still, I paid good money for a printer that purported to do high quality color prints so...it's a con.  (There are some caveats to this - it is most noticeable in large blocks of relatively textureless color, and having really high resolution might mitigate it, although not with the textureless areas.)- Refuses to print address labels.  It could and now it can't.  It gets the registry wrong or the paper gets stuck and you have to open up the innards and fish out the label sheet.  This often ruins and wastes at least half the sheet because if it wouldn't take a new sheet of labels, it definitely won't take a slightly crumpled sheet of labels.  Fortunately, my ancient HP has no qualms with either new or slightly crumpled label sheets.- Ink is too expensive.  This issue varies depending on the person and their office needs.  I need to do a lot of non-photo color printing and also a moderate amount of b&w printing.  I like the speed of this machine, but I run through the ink cartridges way, way too fast.  What initially attracted me to this machine was the high cost of HP-brand ink and also I was curious about the separate ink cartridge system.  I now know that if you are just generally printing a lot of color prints and not specifically favoring one color over the other (like, say, printing letterhead/logos that favor one color over the others), you're going to run through the different colors relatively evenly.  There is some wastage, but not enough, in my opinion, to justify a multiplicity of plastic, disposable cartridges.  (A lot of people recycle theirs but let's face it, a lot of people don't.)  Finding that the cartridge costs were just as onerous as with my ancient HP (and with a machine that was way too temperamental in comparison), I decided to try out ink refills at my local Costco.  Except!  Although they do offer Lexmark refills, they do not offer it for the type of cartridge that this machine takes.  So if you are looking for a machine that will save you on ink costs, a different type of cartridge system probably won't make a difference, but finding a machine that can easily be supplied with refills will.For my money, I'm going back to HP.  This is my first and last Lexmark.  It's a fine machine for office printing, i.e. just black and white documents (the automatic double-sided printing is really very nice), but beyond that it isn't worth it.  2 stars for occasional convenience and the fact that it is on sale in practically every office store.  Print-quality wise, it's hands down beaten by an HP that's going on seven or eight years old.",0,0

The touch screen, well was insensitive and would not work half the time.  I returned it for a full refund.  Why did they make this piece of junk?  Quality control is horrific and the product simply does not function with any ease for the user.  That is my brief experience with Palm's TX.  I then thought of upgrading to the new Palm and I saw even more horrific customer comments and reviews.  I was lucky mine was broke out of the box.  Others are stuck with broken product after the warrantee expired!  That's not good for business or for us customers.  Palm is not deserving to remain in business with defective products it is pushing upon us consumers.  I gave them a decent level chance and they did not deliver on the promise they made.  Vote with your wallet.  We demand high quality, product longevity, ease of use, compatibility, 801.g not the slow 801.b WiFi and just plain value for our hard-earned money. We just want a product that works as advertised.  Is that too much to ask?  That's what Palm needs to do to satisfy this customer!  I demand professionalism when purchasing professional products.

This should be a $2.99 product.Packaging: -5 stars. Honestly, I thought all the complaining about the packaging had to be nonsense...how could it possibly be that bad.  It most certainly is. It is without question the worst packaging I have ever encountered. Ever! Very strong and steady hands are required...lack thereof and you would not be able to open it.  Removal also requires careful use of a razor knife.  Without that, it would be impossible for a normal human being to remove the product from the industrial strength, impossible to tear, stretchy, obnoxious shrink wrap.  With a razor knife it is still a royal pain and because the product is so small actually quite dangerous.  Just put the darn thing in a little box for goodness' sake.Overall: 2 stars.  I'm torn.

An electric drill! a nail gun! this thing was A NIGHTMARE! it took me 4 hours to put together. i think it would have taken 2 if i had the power tools!The back panel had a big gash taken out of it on arrival. There are certain pieces of wood that require a screw to go into it but there is no HOLE for the screw! you have to make it yourself! so some of mine went in crooked and came out on the other side of the wood leaving holes and chips! THIS SUCKS!!!Also, the little wood pieces they give you that youre supposed to stick into it to connect pieces of wood together were TOO SMALL! so they werent secure in the holes which caused the wood to connect loosely! this thing is not secure. I guess i have to add glue or something! In some places it was hard to hammer the nail in even though it said a nail was supposed to go there! I guess i need a NAIL GUN! ALSO IT DIDNT COME WITH ENOUGH NAILS SO I HAD TO GO TO THE STORE AND BUY SOME!The least they could have done was partially assembled it! i had to put every piece together and build every drawer!

R1DA6WQHZ84LIQ,"If I could give this a zero rating I would.  This printer is the biggest piece of junk I have ever owned.  I have to clean the ink heads every time I want to print something, and I mean EVERY time.  I'm writing this review as I am yet again waiting for the heads to finish cleaning so I can print one simple page.I replaced the ink cartridges about 2 weeks ago and they are already dried out.The cover doesn't close properly and never has.I am CONSTANTLY turning it off and on to try to get it to work. Unplugging and plugging, Unplugging and plugging,Unplugging and plugging,Unplugging and plugging,Unplugging and plugging,It freezes when I try to cancel a print job and will not delete it from the cache. Then it won't communicate with the computer.It won't turn on when I want it to.  It won't turn off when I want it to.It just finished a ""deep"" cleaning and now doesn't print anything with the brand new cartridges.Good grief.  Avoid this piece of crap at all cost.  I'm going to go buy a $49 Canon.  At least those will print a single page when I need it. Do yourself a favor and do the same if you actually want to print something.JUNK",0,0
RZT94V8Y2Y07F,"Extremely disappointing!!I never write reviews, and would not even give it one star if it would let me do zero, but I felt compelled to write this one because of how terrible these markers are. I even double-check led that the seller was actually Expo. I received the markers in a small (but way too large for the item) box. The markers were not even packaged. They look identical to the old Expo markers I am replacing, but the ink color is incredibly faint - in fact, it is MARKEDLY lighter than the drying up markers I am replacing. I can barely see the letters unless I am standing right next to the white board. I'm confused by how bad they are. Definitely would not order again.Not to mention I am now out of my $$ because when I tried to return for e refund it says they cannot be returned. Complete BS!",0,0
R1JXBRAUEY8SRH,"Bought this printer about 4 months from a different retailer and will be returning it later this week. As several other reviewers have noted, there are serious problems with the wireless connection. When I first got the printer, the software included on the CD was not the correct version needed to operate the scanner. Annoying, but resolved the issue by downloading the correct software from the HP website. But ever since then I've had endless problems with the wireless. Some days it works, some days it doesn't. My favorite is when I run the wireless network test, it prints out a document saying that everything is working, and then when I try to print a Word doc, I get an error message. This printer has printed more unwanted test pages than documents I've actually tried to print. I've spent hours resetting the wireless connection and running the various diagnostic tools to no avail. This terrible device will be returned and I'll be buying a different brand of printer from now on.",0,0

I figured they would either fix or discard the bad one but instead, they sent it to me.  Was very upset to see it and after a close look, it was in fact the same bad one.  The pen holder is turned incorrectly outward thus making the pens sit on the table rather than on the metal of the piece.  I purchased 2 of these for several friends who recently graduated dental school and the second one we got was ok.  The hand of the dentist was mangled in the second but no the first.  So now we have to decide if we can live with the second.  Quality seems to be hit or miss so purchasing will be a guess on this item.

RGXSJQOQIL2CE,"Where to begin? Don't write many reviews, but this is so deserving of one:1. If it does print, there are often lines of varying size and quantity. Sometimes the printed text is completely illegible. Always cleaning the print head.2. Rarely prints at all. I believe their Windows 7 driver and/or printer firmware is very buggy. Print job spools, printer pulls paper in its feeder, and then...nothing. Job stays in the spooler. Have to log out or reboot to get the job ""unstuck."" Sometimes it will start to print it when Windows reboots.3. Ink dries up before you can use it up.4. Paper continually jams.5. Missing a hinge from day one and remaining hinge is flimsy such that I have to work to keep it together when lifting the lid to access the bed.6.

R20NS83BB709OA,"UPDATE:After using this wallet daily for almost 6 months, I'm disappointed to say it's made of a very poor quality material. The edges are rubbing off and fraying making it look old and cheap. I'm retracting my rating to one star.While it still looks good inside outside looks bad. I've used it as a clutch, tucked under my arm, in a compartment in a back pack or in my purse. In none of these instances was the wallet knocked around to justify its condition.I can't honestly recommend this wallet to anyone. The one star is for the charger, which is available separately if you're interested.Please see the pictures added below.I like this wallet... alot! The only reason I won't give it 5 stars is because it's a bit on the large side for a wallet to me.The height and width are fine, but the length (about 8 inches) could lose about 2 inches and still fit everything I carry including my cell phone. The number of slots are adequate, it takes your DL and six other cards. You can comfortably slide a check register up under those slots (if you still carry one like I do). The three sections are roomy. The center section is zippered and holds cash and coins well. The charger barely takes up room in the back section. I placed the few paper coupons I carried there with room. The front section fits my cell phone (Samsung S3) in its protective case with no problem.Lastly, there's a zippered section in the back for flat items. The charger is a nice bonus, holds its charge long, if you don't use it and charges your phone at a reasonable rate. I can even fit my key chain. Like, I said, nice and roomy. The other solution to make the larger size practical would be the addition of an optional long, adjustable strap so that it can be carried like a neat small purse. That would make it 5 star in my books!",0,0
ROXD76T7TQ180,"Terribly hard to get to work with my Chromebook. Good instructions don't exist. Especially if you only have a Chromebook. Got lots of bad advice from Samsung tech support.  You have to use a PC or laptop but instructions don't directly tell you that. I don't have one. Samsung tech support eventually told me I could take the printer to someone who did have a PC and set it up there. They said to bring the printer back home and I would then be able to easily make it work on my wireless connection by changing the printer's address just using the Chromebook. That was totally wrong. You can't do that. Next Samsung tech support told me my Chromebook firewall was causing the problem and I should call the Chromebook manufacturer's tech support and have then fix that problem.  Wrong again! More hassle going down a blind alley. Finally, two tech savvy sons-in-law came over with a PC and, after two hours, got it working.  Basic problem is that understandable instructions do not exist anywhere...especially if you just have a Chromebook. The same problem might happen with any Cloud Ready printer you buy, I don't know. One thing I do know for a fact is that the Samsung tech support people I talked to really had no clue how to help me.  I called them at least three times and talked to a different person every time. Never got any helpful help or advice from any of them. I give two stars because now that it is finally working, it works just fine.",0,0

Upon further inspection of the cartridges, where my previous Canon cartridge has the color name on the cartridge label, these cartridges have Setup. I ordered two sets because the price was good.

R1YQQN3Q7AM8NE,"I inherited the HP Photosmart Plus because it was bought for an international visitor days before departure from the US, and the brand-new unit would not work out of the box. We spent hours on it, but could not get it to recognize its own HP ink cartridges! Finally, we called technical support, who ran through a battery of standard issues before concluding that I needed a new print head.We received the replacement print head and promptly installed it. It was of no use. We changed the ink cartridges to the new ones that came with the new print head, and the cartridge tray got stuck in its housing. We could not pull it out.By now, it was too late for the printer to make the international trip, so it was dumped in my hands. After many more hours on the phone, HP sent me a refurbished printer. Now I had a used device after paying for a new one! But it at least worked.A few weeks ago, the ink ran out after we printed a bunch of photos. I swapped all the cartridges with genuine HP cartridges that came along with the replacement printer, and they are not recognized!

R1M358KH2D1331,"Okay, so this device clearly states, ""Coin Manager Pro,"" NOT ""Coin Counter."" I simply assumed that when one of the coin slots was full, that was an indication that it was correctly counted and ready to be placed in a coin sleeve. WRONG! The slots actually hold more coins than can be held in a coin sleeve, BUT upon further investigation, with a bright light and magnifying glass, there are graduations on the sides of each coin slot that show the monetary amount. However, when I placed $10 worth of quarters in the quarter slot, the stack of quarters was exactly one quarter past the hash mark on the slot, and yes I recounted to be sure. So while this item was not dishonest about what it is, it's still very hard to read and seemed a little inaccurate to boot. I would have given this item a one star if it had called itself a ""Coin Counter."" Bottom line is that I am returning this item due to the fact it's nearly impossible to easily see count marks on the sides of the slots, and the count marks seemed to be inaccurate as well.",0,0

R3OKLZ85YMKMHZ,"It's not a completely bad chair, but it does have its drawbacks.  I needed a sturdy, cheap chair for a basement office space, and from the pics and reviews this looked like it would work.  Everything arrived perfectly -- no problems with packaging, all of the parts were there, etc., although it had a strange smell to it, but I guess that's to be expected since some of the chair is actually vinyl.  Assembly was not that great of an experience -- some of the instructions were a little misleading, but worse than that, it took an incredible amount of time to get the bolts from the arms to connect through the leather (i think this part is actually leather) and padding to nut.  It was very frustrating -- I really had to play around with it to get it to connect.  Once everything is assembled, the chair is actually quite comfortable.  However, it is cheaply made.  For example, the back rest cushion is actually fairly crooked -- its sewn on and has a noticeable incline looking at it head-on.  The structure of the chair itself seems sturdy, but i have my doubts about the leather lasting for any long period of time -- it's definitely not the highest quality, even for bonded leather.My biggest problem with this chair, and why I gave it 2 stars instead of 3, is actually something that I think is a little dangerous. If you use this chair, be warned that you really should wear shoes that protect the back of your ankles.  I'm sure that sounds strange in a review for a chair, but the metal base is incredibly sharp where it extends over the wheels.  I've knocked the back of my ankles into it a number of times, and it hurt.  A lot.  On one occasion I hit hard enough that it actually drew a little blood.  I'm sure I could put duct take on it to fix the sharpness, but after spending $200 on it, I would think I should expect a chair that isn't trying to hobble me.",0,0

R1F77MEQ5YRIP0,"I'm guessing here that everyone who has rated this chair has rated it after very short period of time usage (possibly even within a week). I have absolutely no idea how the ratings are so high. I absolutely NEVER review anything on amazon unless it is a really great product and I'm happy about it, but my experience with this chair has been absolutely egregious and I'm seething while I'm writing this.The chair looks nice, it has a very nice appearance, however it is evident that the company who manufactured this chair has zero quality control, and no desire to have good customer support. I laughed reading someone else's joke on here about the company name (Cavalier) because it is very fitting to how they treat you as a customer.Now, that being said. I have NEVER, and I mean NEVER purchased or even used a product with as poor quality control as this one. Every single screw falls out despite being relentlessly tightened down meticulously (I am an engineer so I do not cut corners). There are holes through which the screws fit and these circular pieces that are inserted over the holes for aesthetic are consistently found on the ground, no matter how many times I put them back where they go. I sit back, (and mind you, I am 120 lbs at most), and the chair falls apart and breaks because the screws don't stay put. The seat portion of the chair is built for inhumanely long thighs (my body type is long and lanky) and because of this alone, it is very poor for any back support. I keep a back support cushion at the back of the chair which is at the thinnest portions at least 2 inches thick and my very long legs still are off the ground when I'm sitting with my back against the chair.DO NOT buy this item. The customer support is absolutely horrible and they want to charge you $15 for any replacement screws (no, you have to buy the whole kit). They provide no replacement screws initially (only the exact amount, I'm sure to save money because they seem very cheap). The entirety of the chair is $90 and paying $15 just for some screws is ridiculous.Okay, put this way, if you don't mind having tripping and choking hazards all over your floor (circular pieces and screws) and you aren't actually going to sit in the chair, then this $90 decoration would be a very nice addition. Don't plan on sitting in it. In addition, if you really enjoy a quick pick-me-up every morning of reassembling your office chair, then this chair may be perfect for you as well. Just make sure to buy the appropriate hex screw because they won't provide that for you. Oh, and definitely keep your hex key on your desk for convenience.",0,0

I purchased a metal protective case for it and I purchased a special remote alpha/numeric keypad.  I thought it was the greatest of all the Palm devices I had ever purchased!  Having left a positive feedback on this purchase I am no longer allowed to make any further comments.But now I have lost ten years of vital data.  I had been buying Palm products every since they had a memory of only half a megabyte.  Now I have lost all personal and business information that I acquired over all these last ten years.  And when I call them for customer support they refuse to be responsible and demand that I pay then to just look into the robleem.,0,0

RUO4AFR1AYTE7,"I bought 2 of these (Pro901s) printers for my business with all the good media reviews on amazon and elsewhere.My experience with these printers have been awful. First 2 out of 2 the printers were not printing correctly when I received them and after I set it up. Network setup went fine. But the primary purpose of the printers were lacking. The printouts were unacceptable and after spending extensive time with overseas call centers in troubleshooting them they said that the firmware had to be upgraded. When this did not do the job they had to ship over new print-heads for both of them. Immediately after which the printers appeared to print an acceptable output. However, after a few months had passed, the same problem reared its ugly head. The same process were followed in updating firmware and then the shipment of new print heads. Even today, everytime I send something to the printer it feels like a gamble and 3/5 times the prints are unacceptable. These printers are the most unreliable piece of office equipment I have encountered.Second big issue, the ink on the printers seem to just dry up by themselves without much use. If the printer stays idle for a week or two the printers seem to need having to go through cycles of ""clean"" and ""deep clean"" the heads to get them to function acceptably or need an entire new cartridges. So much of low cost of black ink or any ink. These printers are ink guzzlers.Third big issue, every time a print is sent from the computers my wireless Dell wakes up immediately and I do not have to think twice and automatically expect it to be waiting for me at the printer. However, with these Pro901s it is a constant gamble. My employees are constantly craning their necks like jack-in-box's looking to see if the print they sent to it is coming out or not. Some take the touble of walking all the way to the printer to turn it on, just to make sure they are doing everything possible so that they could get their print-out.Now, my favored printers in the past were previous Lexmarks and I stuck with them and bought this promising product but I am so uttlerly disappointed that I will probably never buy any Lexmark unless something improves dramatically.For those looking at this product, please look elsewhere. Don't gamble with your hard-earned money. I don't even want to talk to Lexmark about these units unless they have new models that work as reliable as the ones they used to make. I just feel like I threw away a good $500-600s on them.I also suspect that most of the good reviews on this board are set ups and sales pitches. The ink savings are absolutely not there with the number of clogs encountered and the number of cartridge replacements you have to buy. These printers cannot prossibly have such glowing reviews. The mission of what they set out to accomplish is great but they are extremely unreliable. Also, the glowing reviews are probably customers who bought them just recently. I bought one first and thought I liked it and bought the other one weeks apart. I would love to hear their comments 4-6 months and later.Very frustrated customer!Good Luck!",0,0

I think that it would probably only stay on somewhat securely if the arm of the sofa or chair is flat and about 6 inches wide.

R2RSV566ETBTWM,"At the time of this writing, the printer has generally negative reviews, of which I understand and agree with. When I bought this printer, it actually had good reviews and even good video reviews on YouTube. It was very exciting to get a printer with a display, wireless capabilities and cheap ink!The printer is great in theory, but falls a short of reasonable expectations.The black ink is cheap, but it won't let you print unless all the ink cartridges are full to prevent damage to the printhead. Unfortunately, this means that the cheap ($5) black ink cartridge won't be the only ink you need to purchase, and the color ink is expensive as expected. Even if you take care to avoid printing in color, it happens when you forget to adjust the print settings, when you forget to select B&W copy instead of just copy, when it is aligns or cleans the cartridges, etc.Technology flies forward, and sometimes some of our older electronics feel slow. This printer is relatively slow, especially to start up, even from just sleep mode. It doesn't operate quickly even when it is on, but with a little patience, no big deal but worth noting.It doesn't always play nice with the different computers in the house. I have an XP, Vista, 7 and 8 machines, but with a little bit of time, you can get it to work. Also, it appears that there have been firmware updates so look to make sure your printer is up-to-date.The scanner jams sometimes when pulling from the auto feeder tray. That top part eventually broke, with minimal use, thereby making all scans from that point on blurry somehow. The hinges are made of thin and small plastic so it can break very easily. I removed the hinge and the feeder works again, but now be extra careful since it doesn't have 1 of the 2 hinges.For the price I paid I expected a better product. There are other printers which that are much more durable, and ultimately, even with more expensive ink, have a lower cost of ownership. Actually, for the use this printer gave, IT HAS THE HIGHEST COST OF OWNERSHIP out of all the printers I have used.This model has been replaced with a newer one, which I have had the benefit of using at work. It is much faster, and more solid, I have reservations about recommending it because this older model was a poor performer. If you're in the market for a new printer, stay away from this one given that even within Lexmark there are better options.Thanks for taking the time to read my review, I hope it helps.",0,0

R1DBI4DHUPO0LU,"Hit or miss performance, but extremely frustrating recurring problems that are well documented by other reviewers.We've suffered through this thing for about 2 years.  Tonight was the last straw, will be promptly replacing and never buying from Lexmark again.Software is overly complicated, bulky, and slow, but it works... usually.One problem is that the printer loses connection with the network computers: sometimes we'd have to restart the computer, sometimes we'd have to reboot the printer.Print head is a nightmare.  $200 machine brought low by a $5 plastic part.  Will print the first half of a multipage document fine, and then half-way through starts spitting out white paper.  Clean print heads (use a lot of ink) and then the printing works again.  Basically, before every use we had to clean print heads, which gets expensive when color ink is $50 a set.  If you're out of color ink, the print heads won't clean, you must refill them before it will do it.  When that happened, we were left with a printer that spit out white paper, and couldn't clean the print heads because we were out of color, and all we were trying to do was print black and white documents.",0,0

The window was open, and everything was great. Then night came, the window was closed, and the room began to fill with a noxious miasma.I tried more airing out. Per some suggestions here, I tried soaking it in baking soda in my tub. This resulted in the mat filling my entire house with the poisonous reek, which literally woke me up in the middle night with its strength, in my bedroom with the door closed.

R3UXO68BRRB9DK,"I was so excited to try these.  I'd heard a few people rave about them and saw the positive reviews. BUT I hate these.  Plain & simple.  I am an actor and use highlighters all the time for scripts.  These are about the worst I've ever had.  Because the nib is so large, it is very hard to be accurate with them and I ended up highlighting half of the lines above or below those intended.  The coverage is horrible on one pass.  In order to fully highlight something, you have to color, like with a crayon, over it multiple times. Aside from the inefficiency of this, it also burn through the highlighter at a rapid pace. Pieces of the gel flake off very easily and either build up on the nib or stick to the page, making a terrible mess and highlighting something you might not have wanted highlighted.  The waxy finish is slightly sticky, so the pages stick together and, when you highlight something on the next page, the color from the previous page transfers to the other side.  There does seem to be some difference in performance between the colors, with yellow being the most successful, but even the yellow is extremely sub-par.",0,0

R38ISHTYR3NP1O,"When I first bought this printer I was very pleased with it.  It's set up was incredibly easy, including the Wifi, and the quality was awesome.  It would have received 5 stars from me.It has since (less than a year an half) become almost useless.  The first issue was the wifi suddenly, randomly not connecting with the printer, even though the set up and location has not changed one bit.  Next my wife's computer was suddenly not able to print at all using the wifi, and it has never worked since.  We contacted customer support and did everything they recommended, including new driver downloads etc, and even though the system says its working...it will not print.  ""Cannot find printer"" etc.Next it started to jam, and did it many times.  Each time we carefully removed the paper exactly as they recommend, but it clearly had an effect on both the roller that feeds the paper and the printing itself. Now it jams around 50% of the time. Lastly the hinge that supports the upper lift up portion broke.  I can't actually see what has broken, but it no longer has any tension to it.  This is a problem because when you scan, light is being allowed in from the sides at the back, and the quality is drastically reduced.I don't doubt that some people have had good luck with this printer, as I said, I did initially and I loved it.  However, there seems to be far more people who have had trouble with it than not, so you may want to keep looking.  I wouldn't recommend this to my worst enemy.  Then again, maybe I would... ;o)",0,0
RIHBUA1W5MYV2,"I bought this printer in May 2015 and pretty much tolerated it for the first couple years. Yes, it would disconnect from wifi every once in awhile, and it was annoying to have to reinstall drivers to get it working again. But I got it cheap at a time when there were few affordably priced laser printers, so I considered it a trade-off. However, HP has now taken over and things have gone from mediocre to absolutely awful. It will no longer connect to wireless at all, even after I scoured the internet for the drivers (HP's customer service is non-existent, so don't bother asking for help). All of the documentation online is ancient. In fact, I was surprised to see that it is still for sale because I was sure it had been discontinued. I have no idea how they can sell a printer that no longer has online support or current drivers. Based on my experience, as well as the reviews here and elsewhere online, this model should be considered a wired laser printer that occasionally gives you the gift of wireless connectivity once a year. I've already ordered a different brand and look forward to going Office Space on this one.",0,0

It would be one thing if I was the exception, but apparently I'm not. At least have some freaking troubleshooting somewhere, Samsung.Did I mention, ""very frustrating""?06/28/15 UPDATE: I talked to text support today to resolve the issue, kind of. The call was 1:40 long. The guy I spoke to was the only positive really (very nice and accommodating).

But I NEED to find a better paper for actual production runs.I saw the seller respond to review stating that moisture will make the paper curl...

RYG23FWC8PMUZ,"This is the worst product that I have ever ordered from Avery/Amazon. Instead of the sheet protectors that I have always used, that are sturdy and supportive of the sheet; I got a foggy, floppy plastic bag with 3 holes punched, through the bag, along one side. As others have noted, the holes do not line up with standard 3 hole papers.  It is a ridiculous product. I would have given it a zero star if I could.",0,0
R3JIVPZ6XPRKIM,"I'll make this short, since most of my experience has been well expressed by others.The Pro901 was easy to set up with my wireless network. My XP and Win 7 machines worked well with the software and the printer.Print quality was very good for about 50 pages, although I did notice the print levels going down at an alarming rate. I used the copy and fax functions, which were fine. (Although be aware that ANY incoming call will awaken the printer, which is a poor design.)After about 50 pages, I noticed banding when printing cyan. I tried the various cleaning and aligning options with no improvement. (That really hit the print levels badly. Black was down to about 50%. I can't understand this as I was using the Quick Print setting most of the time.)I chatted with a Lexmark rep who was very responsive. They arranged to send a replacement printhead and new cartridges, which I received overnight. (Great service.)After reading all the bad experiences here, though, I decided to return the printer (while I could) and look for a better choice. I just don't have faith that a new printhead is likely to provide smooth sailing in the future. And even if it would, the ink consumption is unacceptable. (As an aside, you should be aware that the printer will not accept anything other than a Lexmark cartridge. This was introduced in a firmware level recently.)A printer should be reliable out of the box. While Lexmark has great customer service, it should also understand that good service does not take the sting out of bad quality. The best service is no service.",0,0
R1N4OGUWEQGOMJ,I thought these would be normal greeting cards. They were rated 4.5 stars with hundreds of reviews and I am familiar with the brand.  They are terribly thin paper.

When I took the orange cover off the ink literally exploded out of the cartridge.  It dripped into the stainless steel sink instead of on the floor, but got all over my hands, and it does not come off.  I turned it over to the position it would take in the printer and the ink just runs out for a bit.  Installed it in my printer and the printer will not accept or use it.

R3N9NHFEYFQIIB,I bought this to try and bring my keyboard/ mouse closer to me in order to play games more comfortably. The material used is cheap and was cheaply made. All the screws loosen up easily and it almost falls apart if used often. The reason I gave this a 2 star is because ultimately its not balanced enough even when the screws are tightened enough. The table part slouches so badly before you know it your typing at an angle even when you use a laptop because underneath it has no level control except for a screw that holds it up by the weight.,0,0
R1PCMGJVMOT0QA,"***********UPDATE*********** - 3 months later, I would give this NEGATIVE 5 stars.- There is no more resistance to keep the tray elevated.- Likewise no resistance to keep tray from swiveling - which results in table becoming off balance and even falling.- The wheels don't swivel well, so pushing it on hardwood just scrapes the floor. (which contributes to the risk of table falling over)- 2 of the wheel 'locks' have broken off.Really - BUY SOMETHING ELSE. I just can't believe anyone would rate this positively.***********Original review***********I don't get why anyone would give this 5 stars. Maybe they've never seen another rolling laptop table like this ever before. If I could give this a 0, I would. Heck, I'd give it a negative 5 if I could. I've never been more disappointed after opening a box... Where do I start.1) All of the ""hardware"" that holds this together and allows you to ""adjust"" it are made of relatively flimsy plastic. I doubt they can bare much weight. If you use this often and leave you computer on it so the time, I'm quite sure it will break.2) Even the metal fasteners are extremely cheap steel. You can't buy this low quality in a hardware store in the US. The screws and nuts are easily capable of de-threading each other. If you hold out a screw and wrap the thread with a screwdriver, you will dent it and it will no longer be fully useable (well, for this table you might because half of it is plastic). To dent threads on a discount store, discount screw, you typically need to hammer a screwdriver or chisel into it. Like I said, you can't buy this low strength alloy in North America.3) The casters, like everything else, are small, flimsy and all plastic. The ""locks"" as they call them have no real mechanism to hold them in ""locked"" position. When I locked and unlocked one about 20 times in a row, it ceased to be about to prevent the wheel from turning.4) Nothing can be securely fastened. Every piece has some wiggly and give to it. I'm good with my hands and have expertly assembled countless pieces of furniture and mechanical pieces. I assembled this table as perfectly as can be done. Wiggle wobble every piece every direction.5) It's MUCH smaller than it seems in the pictures. Especially the misleading image that shows 23.6"" measurement for the main tray. That's the length across both trays at the middle where it's rounded. The actual width you have for your laptop is just under 15""I will update this review when it breaks and becomes unusable. I expect that to be in less than 3 months. If it's still alive in 3-4 months and proves any bit of my original assessment wrong, I'll share that as well.Until then, there's no reason on Earth to buy this. There are similarly priced tables all over Amazon. Even if they are horrible, they can't be any worse than this.",0,0
R1Y366BZT3NU1T,"UPDATE: Since purchasing another set, I have been storing these in a ziplock bag, caps down. It seems to be working out. I'm still irritated that these dry out so quickly and I wish there was a better alternative.As mentioned in other reviews, the cap design is TERRIBLE. There are holes in the cap so the markers dry out. I've had them barely a month and they are all dried out. Buying another set (I need them for an upcoming GRE at-home examination) and will try sealing them in a plastic ziplock bag when not using them. So frustrating. Also, the ultra fine point goes away fairly quickly. I have been using one pen a lot (in an attempt to preserve the others!) and don't push hard but it's last the 'ultra fine' characteristic. It's still fine for what I need (doing lots of math). The most frustrating part is how quickly these pens dry out.

R2TZKP9LUYOQ89,"PLEASE...everyone must know this is NOT a solid substrate material like that of a dry-erase board or chalkboard!  This is a very crummy approximation of a blackboard (or chalkboard) surface that is ""flexible,"" as it comes rolled up and must be rolled out flat and weighted down (preferably in a warm sunny location) to get it to remain even remotely flat.  Be aware, it DOESN'T flatten out cleanly & neatly by simply slapping it onto a magnetic surface!  That was especially annoying.Furthermore, to establish clarity over what this is and/or is not, please accept this basic physical description to better inform your decision making process:This is a thin, relatively crude magnetic material that is essentially the same sort of flexible, easy to cut, semi-magnetic backing material found on the back of cheap refrigerator magnets or the removable or temporary magnetic signs / insignia that can be applied to car doors or the side of a panel van in business applications such as realtors who advertise on the side of their personal vehicles or some other delivery drivers who use their own personal vehicle, which preclude affixing more permanent vinyl lettering, etc.  This material is NOT very magnetic most of the time and this chalkboard backing is no exception.  It barely holds to stainless steel refrigerators--so don't be fooled.Now, that thin magnetic backing is adhered to a black paper surface that is what the customer ""sees"" as the chalkboard surface.  This paper is extremely thin and it is laminated with an even thinner clear plastic, ""erasable"" or wipeable surface that is what the customer actually physically writes upon.  To make it abundantly clear, this is a clumsily & crudely crafted black dry-erase surface that is made of laminated black paper....not metal, wood, slate or a hard acrylic or thermoplastic of any kind.Why do I make this all so unmistakably apparent to you?  Because, it took me mere minutes to destroy the blackboard surface by doing nothing more than wiping my refrigerator door with a damp kitchen cloth--a chamois to my precise.  It was not soaking wet and had no cleaning chemicals or soap on it....just warm tap water.  Within a few seconds I noticed the edges of the blackboard were swollen, bubbled up and upon closer inspection, the paper had taken in moisture that then began separating the ultra thin clear laminate covering from the black paper.It was not repairable!  Just to test further, I wiped over the surface of the blackboard once more with a barely dampened paper towel and waited a minute or two before assessing how it affected the materials.  Sadly, the extremely small amount of additional moisture was immediately absorbed into the paper along the exposed edge and it was more pronounced in the already puffy, swollen & separated spots that all formed only around the edges of the ""chalkboard"" lookalike material.The black paper then swelled and itself began coming apart to show the white cellulose paper that was PRINTED BLACK WITH INK.  It isn't even solid black paper using black dyed paper pulp to manufacture the product.  It's white paper, inked in black that is laminated with the thinnest plastic laminate I've personally ever seen on any paper product.So, in short, you won't get much use out of this if, like me, you keep a clean kitchen and your kitchen has humidity, moisture, running water and/or humans with wet hands or any other source of moisture because IT'S NOT WASHABLE IN THE LEAST!LAST....the chalk makers suck worse than the ""board"" in that two of mine are dried out upon first use.  The other two were interesting but nothing to be excited about.  The markers are ridiculously small and will provide a few months of use at best, but with consistent daily or weekly use, I fear you'll find yours dried up or exhausted entirely, so take this into account.If you buy this, you might as well purchase a decent set of neon chalk markers & toss the crummy ones that come in this silly kitI'm sorry I can't offer any more positive review, but I strive to be as honest and forthright in all of my reviews as possible to inform prospecting buyers so they know what to expect themselves and can decide accordingly!Good luck.P.S.  I have actually purchased instead a real chalkboard in a great wood frame that looks sharp and can hang from any surface depending upon the method of attachment.  I simply used 3M brand heavy duty double-sided tape to adhere several thin, black enameled neodymium (rare earth) magnets that are bar-shaped and provide more than enough real magnetic holding power and they are completely moisture proof, don't scratch my stainless steel fridge because of the nicely enameled coating....and the best part is that I bought a set of 10 (leaving me four extras for another project) and it cost less than $11 (magnets & 3M tape) + $31 (solid, real, non-porous chalkboard that looks sharp & works the way it should) + $10 (full set of 16 AWESOME chalk-markers in thin & broad tips & great neon colors that really pop on that black background)!  Something I'll use for a very long time and I know now, I should have simply invested wisely in the better materials rather than trust this other product that in hindsight is just too good to be true.",0,0
R524VSQF8IMUM,"I am very disappointed in the photo quality of this printer.  It is beyond me how anyone can write a review and say that the quality of the prints are great.  Each of the photos are faded, and there is nothing you can do about it.  I compared a print from this printer to a canon print, and it was night and day difference.  I am not just talking photographs, but just printing color of any kind.  I also noticed that the black print is faded as well.  What a total waste of money.",0,0

R1BFTNUNZASOI2,"Box and packing was good,,Directions better than most, hardware of top quality,,Assembly,,may need a helper.I smiled when I received this chair ,,, Everything was going great untill I got to the arms in the Assembly. The left arm bolted up fine. The right arm however was a different story. Two bolts hold on each arm. One goes in the side of the back and the other goes into the side of the seat. The bolts screw into a nut welded to a frame of sort under the outer cover, two on each side. Three  of the four were attached so they were just under the cover and you could see them. Those three bolted right up without a hitch. The fourth however, the second of the two on the right arm,,well this is where I quit the smile. At first I could not even find the nut. The hole in the cover was there, but no nut. As a matter of fact, where that bolt went there was no frame either. I stuck a screwdriver in the hole and hit the frame ,,, three inch's futher in under the seat. Pushed the bolt in as hard as possible and got the bolt started in the nut and tight. Problem is that pulled the end of the arm in three inches. This in turned pulled in the side of the seat causing it to bunch up which was not going to work for me,,,this is a new $200 chair. See attached pictures.This can not be the only one!! These seats were not made one at a time by hand. They were mass produced making every single seat ran was bad untill it was caught. The factory, the dealer and maybe even amazon knows this chair has a defective seat. The bad part is they let it go. Well there options were throw all away,,, fix by hand each one or take a chance,,and not even offer a discount to us. This chair is what you call a""second"" not of quality chair. Something else to think about is I read the reviews,,,no where has anyone even said a word,,,shame,shame,shame, Look at the picture's, they do not lie, Sure,,you can still keep and use the chair but I dont want a new car with a run in the paint, I dont want a pair of new shoe""s with a heal attached backwards and I dont want this chair....Once more this can not be the only chair like this,,,,the parts on this chair are mass produced.......",0,0

RV47CMVQUX2K0,"I got this US scratch off map as, like everyone else I would imagine, a way to visually track all of the states that I've been to.Previously, through this site, I bought a scratch off world map and it was amazing but I really wanted another one just for the states.Based on the pictures, reviews, etc. before purchasing, this looked like the perfect fit for what I wanted.It was a different story one I started scratching off the states.First, the included scratching tools are too harsh for this map and now I have a permanent indent somewhere around Flagstaff, Arizona before I finally realized what was happening and switched for the rest of the time to a much more effective dime.Secondly and the thing that bothers me the most about this map by far is that there are so many overlapping words/places.For example, if you scratch off Washington state, you have also scratched off the large word ""Portland"" from it's southerly neighbor Oregon, even if you don't scratch off Oregon.There are many examples of this but I doubt it would have been too difficult for whoever made this to just keep everything in a state IN that state.While I decided that I wasn't going to complain and return the item, I honestly wouldn't ever purchase one again for any reason or advise anyone else to.",0,0

I have printed less than 1,000 copies on this machine, and have replaced ALL FOUR toners, and the Yellow is already empty AGAIN!  I have called Samsung at least a dozen times; have been 'escalated' to tier-three level support, and still am not satisfied.  They basically refuse to deal with the issue of toner usage, saying it's all based on customer usage.  That's bunk!  Also, I'm getting smudging on the paper, and they say it's the image drum!  Another $100!  NOT HAPPENING!  I paid $199 for this printer, have spent over $300 in toner, and now they want me to replace the image drum?  I don't think so!  It's going into the garbage where it belongs!  I have been a Samsung customer for some time, and told Samsung about my other purchases (refrigerator, LCD TV, DVD, etc.).

R13QY9GCF1KE27,"I do my best NOT to write reviews when I am upset.  But if I stayed with that otherwise simple rule, I'd never write a review of the HP Photosmart Wireless piece of crap.  I usually want to buy a printer that is easy to setup, easy to use, and easy to maintain.  The HPs generally promise each of those things.  The delivery leaves a lot to be desired.  If you are looking for trouble-free, look elsewhere.  First, I get printouts only sporadically. I have ZERO confidence that when I hit ""PRINT"" in whatever program I am in that I will actually get a print out from this HP.  It is wireless and three computers (and an iPad) and directed to it.  It prints MAYBE one out of five or six attempts.  It reports that it has a problem and 0% is printing, and it will try again in 30 seconds, which usually means it will print never.  Sometimes it works, most of the time it doesn't.I threw away the last HP desktop printer I had because it had ""printer head"" issues, and the one before it is forever turned off because my new HP desktop that it's connected to doesn't even recognize it, and HP Customer Complaint line -- it would be foolish to call it customer SERVICE or CARE because it is neither -- told me that the drivers for it are ""out of date"" and that they don't support them anymore.  Goodness!  You'd think there was some software that they could merely send me online that would ""care"" or ""service"" their past customers.But back to the Photosmart.  The look is fine, and the touch screen is cute.  But if you want it to print, this is not the product for you.  If you want to spend $50 every two months for 564 ink with moderate near-daily printing of a page or two, this is your printer! If you want mediocre printed photos that looks like someone smeared film over them or left them in the bright sun for days on end, you may have found your printer!This is an utter disappointment, and poor purchase.  As you see from the ratings, it is not a unique point of view.  Luckily, I didn't purchase a new $50 set of printer ink, because this one is leaving very soon.  It is impossible to recommend this to anyone who values NOT being annoyed, frustrated and disappointed with their online purchases.  Fool me once... fool me twice...",0,0

That's as far as i got because the holes in the frame do not line up so i couldn't go any farther, even though it was clear that there was no need to continue.  The pencil case came misshapen and the frame does not fit together well at all.  I contacted customer service with all the issues to see if they would stand behind their product and fix the problem.  Their only solution was that they could send me a replacement frame bar, while not addressing the pencil case and wheels that don't screw in straight.  I declined that option requesting that they send me an entire new box and a return label to ship this junk back.  They have yet to respond at that point and it's been over a week.

There are lots of pockets, which is good, but they could've been sized better for remotes (the pockets were too big and the remotes would lean this way and that, making the whole thing more unstable).

R1CNXWGC6D6QUT,the hopper on the top of this bill counter is at such an awkward angle. You have to put the stack of bills in at JUST the right angle otherwise they draw in crooked and jam right away.

It literally can’t count a stack of singles without jamming or throwing an error. I have a royal sovereign bill counter which works 1000 times better for only twice the price but what do ya expect for $69. Would not recommend for any large quantity counting or bundling.

R2TQA0AIHF0EFZ,"This printer is complete trash.It worked for the first year, but then maybe because we rarely used it.  We probably printed less than 200 real pages, and 300 or more aligning the print head, printing again because of a bad first attempt, printing a ""print head cleaning page"".  Quality went downhill after that with smeared ink, missing colors (despite FULL ink cartridges), on every attempt. Now after 2 years, I have the dreaded ""Print Head Error"".  For the $50 they want, I'm probably going to be better off going with a new Cannon or Epson, even though I have a full set of unused color cartridges that I paid $45 for (anyone want to buy them?). With Lexmark ""quality"" I know the print head will just fail again in a year. And yes, I updated to the latest firmware.  Although I don't see why I should have to do that.  Why can't Lexmark make a printer that will PRINT, without the need to update?When I bought this 2 years ago the star rating was over 4.  Now look at it, 2.8!  These do not last.

Well, that ""hard surface"" is a piece of cardboard, like shirt cardboard, and it is not attached to the pouch in any way.  So to use it, it just sits in a little area with folds of material to hold it in.  Of course, the folds of cloth do not hold it in, or even come close. So the top of the pouch is worthless for any purpose.  Also, after less than a month, the stitching in the pockets is coming undone.  Also, as I have seen in other reviews, it doesn't stay on the arm of a chair very well.  Its like a balancing act puzzle how much stuff has to be in each side to keep the pouch from slipping.

I  was printing something that didn't really all the colors so I let it sit.  Then today I need to print some photos for a school project.  half through one 4x6"" photo all colors fade.  I printed probably 15 pages all together since the cartridges were installed, including a couple of color tests and clean print head pages.  I removed the cartridges thinking that they must be re-seated again.  They were empty.""That was quick,"" - I thought.  I installed a new set.Half of a 4x6 photo came out almost right, but the other half became unnaturally blue.  I reprinted it again.  Very blue through the photo.  Adjusted the photo digitally for more yellow tint (not original cartridges, probably the yellow is not bright enough?).  Reprinted - super blue.  got yellow cartridge out.  the cartridge itself is contaminated with blue.  Strange, I didn't see it before.  Did cleaning, printed color test.  All colors were way off.  Magenta square had a wide blue line in it.  Orange had a wide green.I pulled the whole print head and found it flooded with ink.  I guess that's where all the ink went from the first set!

RAVF1E9YUR73Y,"I have had this printer since last March. I used it literally a handful of times to print some color labels for my biz and for a handful of blk and white prints. It started having a stripe pattern on the left hand side of the page ruining several labels- this happened two days ago. Then a piece of paper got stuck in the orange roller ball thing at the top- guess what, it is impossible to get paper out of that thing, no dials to move it and if you touch it is is damaged and ruined. Also no way to take that piece out if you try to.I live chatted with Samsung support. They were useless- gave me links telling me to replace the toner and then clean the printer. The paper jam link video did not address something getting jammed in this area, the orange roller ball or whatever it is called.I have hardly used this, it doesn't need toner, the inside was practically spotless.The agent informed me that my warranty was up, based on when it was manufactured- who warranties their products based on that?If I produce a receipt I get to ship it to Samsung, pay for that and possibly get it back in some sort of working condition, but who knows for how long. If not I have to pay for everything and who knows how long it will take or how much it will cost.If I remember correctly I paid $150 for this- it's not worth it. This is imo a very bad purchase, it seemed great, truly, I was very happy with it, but now I truly regret buying this printer. I liked the price and the size since I don't have a lot of space. I may sell it for junk and then buy something of better quality, hopefully, and which is unfortunately a lot more expensive as well as humongous.UPDATE: after 4 communications with Samsung CS 3 online and 2 phone calls I have still not got this resolved... I was asked to send a receipt for my purchase which I did twice. My first 4 hour chat where I gave all the information was LOST by the inept cs agent. At the first phone call I received an apology and I was told I would be sent back a label to ship this printer back for repair as soon as my receipt was received. Now I'm on the phone with an agent named Byron, who is telling me instead of sending me a label to ship back the printer I have to do a firmware update.  He is rude/smug and is now insisting I have to now do an update, yet this will not resolve a printer jamming paper as far as I know and this will not resolve printing a stripe a long the left side of the page as well as randomly printing all over the place. He is a very smug person who likes to bait people and not HELP them.  He informed me that a supervisor was not available to speak to me, but I will get a call back. I will believe it when it happens. Like so many other ""US"" companies Samsung now ships out their CS calls to the philippines or somewhere where people can barely speak english and who try to keep you on the phone for several hours. After 2 minutes with those people you will feel like you want to strangle them. Then eventually if you demand better help you will get transferred to someone in the US who speaks english- the first CS I spoke with in the US was fine, But Byron was not, he is your typical nasty human being who loves to cause problems for people. I have now wasted too many hours of my life trying to get this resolved. My advice to you is DONT BUY ANYTHING FROM SAMSUNG. I never will again. They make good tv/monitors and I was thinking of buying one at some point but I now will NOT do that.  JUST DON'T DEAL WITH SAMSUNG, DON'T BUY THEIR PRODUCTS- IT'S NOT WORTH IT.  I hate companies who don't stand behind their products and who maltreat customers.In addition I feel very upset that I was lied to and given several different stories about what to do with this and the last agent was just plain nasty- unfortunately he has the same name as my noble cat Byron- he should change his name to rat fink...lol. This company just gives you the run around, so don't fall into this booby trap- listen to the 1 star reviews, they're dead on. Please feel free to message me with any questions you may have about my review.UPDATE 2:Just to let you know- I somehow managed after much trial and tribulation and MORE phone calls to Samsung to get a return shipping label sent to me and I shipped back my printer for repair- this past SAT at 3 am, jan 11, 2013 I received an email from Samsung saying that they had not received the printer and that the repair ticket had been cancelled. I fortunately save shipping receipts and looked up the tracking number at UPS. It was delivered and signed for on Jan 11, 2013 by someone named Kim. I called Samsung today and an executive cs rep eventually made a new ticket for my repair. No apology or anything, although she was polite. This company is completely INEPT. I will let you know if it is actually found and repaired now. BTW, I did put all of my information inside with the printer, although the UPS label should be enough to give them that. The CS supervisor who did return my call was very rude to me right off the bat. I gave it back to him and he then purposely did not send me the return shipping label. I complained about him to the next CS rep who sent me the label online as we spoke. I also emailed the president of samsung with an email I found online- I received two phone calls from people higher up at Samsung so I think this was his email. My advice to you if you get into this situation is to persevere. If I get a new printer or advance to something else I guess it will be worth it maybe. I would have preferred to get my money back but it was too late for a return to amazon.UPDATE 3:I have finally received my printer back.  I don't know what happened with Samsung cancelling the repair ticket and if they had really messed up yet another part of this it REALLY wouldn't surprise me at all, lol.  I  have tested my refurbished printer and it seem to be working ok so far. We will see if this holds up or not. For the first time I printed larger images and I have to say that it doesn't handle them very well, the tones  are VERY dark overall. I will try printing on photo paper next time and see if it makes a difference. It has been fine for the labels I did, but I don't think I would use it for photographs very much.",0,0
R14MBDWL2HXI3Q,"I have all my life owned HP printers and I am sad to say that this is by far the worse model they have put out. HP got too ""smart"" on us this time, just look at all the negative reviews and you will find out why. The great advantage that I thought this printer had over the previous models I owned was that it uses 4 individual ink cartridges instead of 1 black and 1 color, which I thought was going to allow me to save on ink. This sounds like a great idea if it weren't for the fact that these cartridges are not like the ones we have been used to all our lives; these cost $10 dollars each and (at least from the black one) you won't get more than 30 normal-quality, text-only pages printed per cartridge. Gone are the good-old days when one could print homeworks, emails, coupons, etc. at home without worrying too much about the ink levels. I also noticed that while the cartridges might still have ink left, the quality starts decreasing quickly until it becomes unacceptable and you will need to change the cartridge anyways; be ready to stock at least 2 of each all the time. Think of this model as a bulky scanner that you can also use to print on emergencies cases, not as a home printer. I find it ridiculous that owning a printer I still find myself having to print at school to save money.",0,0

Even though hardly used, I have to clean the print head constantly (wasting ink) then the print head broke w/in a year.  When the print head does not work, you cannot scan...does not make sense.  I only used the black ink because the color was so poor, however, all the ink must be full to print, even in all black.  Ridiculous.

Even worse, it leaves a gummy coating on whatever you’re trying to glue so that you can’t just use a different glue (i.e. regular glue stick) over the top of it. I would give it zero stars if I could. I can’t say enough bad things about this product. It is completely useless.",0,0

Wireless will seldom work, be prepared to re-setup this thing every time you want to print. Just bought all new ink cartridges and it tells me they are half gone already. Next day it tells me they are all corrupt and i need ot buy new ones. Haver to take all ink cartridges out and clean them, reinstall, re-setup, wait 2 minutes for it to print the stupid system page, then start all over every time i print. Takes FOEREVER to print even the simplest B&W document, stalls in the middle of printing pages for no reason. I have not even tried to print photos, I doubt it can. Possible the LOUDEST printer ever, the entire desk moves when it prints. Warm up will take about 5 minutes. What it's doing, i have no idea, but makes so much racket I'm surprised it doesn't just fall apart. Here's the funny thing, we got this printer for free at the apple store because they screwed up on our order (long story) and still I am so disgusted with the quality and reliability of this printer that I am taking 5 minutes out of my life to write this review.  And because of this experience I will probably NEVER buy another HP products again. If they make junk like this, and this is one of their flagship printers, i can only imagine what kind of other crap the are selling. Don't waste your money, don't believe sympathetic reviews that HP is probably paying for, stay away. Really, stay away. You will want to throw this piece of junk on the garbage the day you take it out of the box. If you really want one come by my house, this thing will be sitting out on the curb, for free.

So I did the next day.Well guess what..the second printer I received had the SAME stupid issue.DO NOT BUY THIS PRINTER............To clarify my problem after printing I receive this notice: ""There is interference with the _______ Ink Cartridge Communication""(it varies from print to print between which cartridge is not ""communicating"", usually between either the black or magenta cartridge)What is really odd is that when I open the top to ""fix"" the issue, it will print one or two pages, then give me the same error, sometimes with a different cartridge (it doesn't matter if I remove and reinstall, or do nothing).What a waste of $200................I thought I was getting a great deal because I rarely use color ink, and at $5 for 500 or so pages of black ink I figured I could not go wrong..unfortunately I picked the wrong printer/company.",0,0

Fine.  Here's a photo - edge on - of the booklet of cards.  See the warp in the stack?

RZ9PRVHB65FT3,"Well, my ""Like New""  binder from the marketplace arrived yesterday. It is rather hilarious. I look for all my purchases in the marketplace, have been disappointed only once, and returned the item for a prompt, no-hassle refund.I'm tempted to keep this Daytimer binder in hopes that someday it will be an extremely rare and priceless collector's find.It is beautiful... It is ""Like New"" indeed,  its stitching perfect and everything in precise alignment. But here's the hilarious: when I opened it the pockets were all upside down! The ""snap strap"" had been sewn to the front, so that the binder's snap closure fastened to the back. If I held the binder correctly with the snap on the front, opening it gave me an upside-down interior, insuring that everything would come flying down out of the pockets. If I wanted the interior correct, with pockets all right-side up, I had to turn the binder 180 degrees and snap the strap onto the BACK side.Also, not one single element of the very helpful  ""starter component"" was included.""Like  New""??? Ridiculous quality control on four fronts; the sewer, the Chinese factory's inspection, the Daytimer USA supervision over QC in China, and Amazon's marketplace evaluators for listing something so screamingly defective, missing as well the very helpful ""start-up"" component, as ""Like New.""First time, for me anyway, that the marketplace has gotten it all so wrong. But it was definitely all worth a laugh. We can all use that, I suppose!Returning it today, a perfect-condition ""Like New"" DT binder, if one would happen to enjoy using it upside-down and without the starter filler. One star, sadly.",0,0
R3R3W703LSXGEI,"For some reason, it wouldn't let my laptop cool. If I had my laptop on a table, my laptop would be fine, wouldn't overheat.

No matter how tight I make it, the table top does not stay flat— not just from side to side, but also the split to tilt feature I can’t tighten enough to stay level. You can not swing it to not be over the wheels (as advertised) unless you want your laptop on the ground. I’m using it as a printer stand for a very basic, light printer and it’s about to slide off, each day it slides further away from the support arm. I’m pretty handy and I can’t get this thing to be anything more than a headache. It’s added zero to my life other than just being in the way.

Don’t waste your money, put the money towards a higher quality version. Wish I did. 1 star is generous. Great table if you want to keep 1 sheet of paper and a pen on it only… can’t write on it without losing your mind from its instability, but it can hold a single piece of paper if that’s all you need it to do.

Over time, and not very much at that, the printer started coming up with new and inventive ways to not print.About 99% of the time, it won't accept the paper...from any tray. It's so slow to attempt to print as well, so you'll be ready to throw it out the window by the time you've got a picture. Maybe if I fill the photo paper tray all the way...Nope. How about half full? Nope. How about if I only put one sheet of photo paper in there...Nope. How about a printing dance, and a let there still be ink chant?

The reviews said that this printer is one of the best and easiest printers to E print if we have a Chromebook.  So much for the reviews.  Big problem.  Samsung Tech support was little and no help.....  Good luck if you purchase this printer.......,0,0
R28ERAQSBINMHC,"UPDATE: Lexmark no longer makes commercial printers, so this review is only here for people buying used or new old stock. My recommendation: avoid ALL Lexmark printers. This company now has little incentive to do anything but sell you overpriced ink. The fact that black ink is cheap becomes meaningless now that they've caused this once beautiful printer to become crippled and useless without a full compliment of color ink. I have never used my color ink, yet it was empty within a couple months of purchase.Pros-----$4.99 for a 500 page black ink cartOnce setup, wireless printing and scanning is fast and easyEnergy StarGreat dynamic touchscreen controls5 year warrantyCons----Color ink still expensive but can be disabled on MOST systems.Though it used to be Easy to disable color printing, that's no longer true. Convoluted and complicated. Lame. Lexmark is nothing but an ink sales company now. Shame.After two years the wife's Windows XP machine now insists that I buy color ink even though I've never used any color ink and it's worked fine without color ink for ages. LAME. Both win7 machines still print in black and white just fine and the printer still copies fine and prints test pages. I guess she'll just have to suffer or join the 21st century of Windows sometime because I highly doubt Lexmark is going to fix this problem. I wasted two hours of calls, chats and screen sharing with their support with no satisfaction.Update:I have never once printed using color on my 901. I've had it since 8/25/10 (2+ years) and it started claiming to be out of all four color cartridges well within the first year. In that time and since I've been through several black cartridges. Then, a couple of months ago, my wife could no longer print from her XP machine. Lexmark claimed that I needed to buy color ink. I assured them I could still print just fine from my Win7 machine, make b/w copies, etc.. After a couple hours of chatting and letting them remotely control her laptop, they got it printing again by switching from ""black ink only"" to ""all available"" - which makes little sense, but whatever. If it made sense, they would have just fixed it instantly, more so, I wouldn't have had a problem to begin with. Here we are two months later, I just put a new black ink cartridge in the Pro901 and now it's trying to tell me it can no longer print in black and white from my Windows 7 machine because the color ink is empty. It's been empty for almost two years and I've printed just fine until now. What a crock of corporate profiteering @@!#%#. Lexmark stopped making commercial hardware (printers) recently, so they're exclusively selling ink. Clearly they're not interested in just selling us $5 cartridges. Great. I will not be buying any more from them. I'm through with this throwaway company. Let me know if a class action starts. I'll take time off to rub Lexmark executives' faces in ink of ANY color ;)Support is spotty at best. Lexmark no longer makes printers so to some extent they lack incentive to support products they've already sold.Wireless setup lacks good instructions for some setupsOn my Cradlepoint router I had to disable the User Login page. Not a huge deal, but added an extra 15 minutes of trial and error to the setup and removes one additional layer of security from my home wifi.Other:To disable color printing on a per-computer basis in some Windows systems:1. Open printers folder under Control Panel.2. Right click on the Lexmark printer then choose printing preferences.3. Check the box for ""print only in black"".I do not use the fax function on this device, but everything else works great. Got it for $175, but it's worth the $199 price I'm seeing now.Summary-------Great value (best around) for black ink. Wireless adds crazy feng shui possibilities. (I have mine hanging from the ceiling.) Poor support.",0,0

My only recourse is to delete the printer from my computer, reinstall it and turn the printer off then back on. Only then will I MAYBE get it to print (about 50-50).

The frame part went together pretty well, but the drawers were a mess. About half the holes were drilled so close to the edge that they were slots, not even holes.

RT2V077EW05VT,"I bought the desk, file cabinet and bookcase of this set and I am quite dissapointed in what I got.The file cabinet was the first piece we assembled. While everything fit together, as a previous review said, the parts do not line up well. One of the drawer slides is messed up and the plastic rails for the hanging folders are not supporting the weight of the files I put in there. When assembling the piece I noticed that it barely supported it's own weight until you nailed the back on. Which brings up my favorite part of the instructions. It tells you to take a screw and hammer it through the back into the frame.The Desk is about the same. Things don't line up very well and very cheap components (drawer slides).This set is not going to stand up to daily use. I just need to figure out how to return it.",0,0

RBT8HYJC7H47E,"They sent the wrong color but did rectify that once I sent proof of the packaging by sending them a photo of the box. That took a few emails back and forth to make happen.The new chair I received has a small hole in the back but because it took so long to get the correct color I let it go. Normally I would have returned it again but did not feel like going through all of that again. After giving it a fair amount of time to be tested (I have had it for a few months) I though I would review it.Plus: The chair looks nice, is comfortable and was reasonably easy to put together once you lined up all the holes. Based on looks it's quite nice.Cons: This chair leans way too far back to be useful as a working desk chair for me. It reclines and has a lever to stop the reclining mechanism from tilting back further. There are 2 reclining positions; too far back and way too far back. The amount of the recline on the upright setting is just too far back. If I lean back in the chair (my back against the back of the chair) I can not reach my keyboard even with my arms outstretched fully. The lever that holds the chair in this (not so upright) position tends to unhook itself and the chair tilts fully back. This can make you feel like you are falling as it tilts back quite far. Today It unlatched twice. The first time I grabbed my keyboard tray on my desk to steady myself and pulled the tray clean off while falling backwards. I was on a business call so not so professional to let out a whoop on the phone as you think you are falling. No points for functionality so not a good recommendation from me.",0,0
R1IOZ6ICU34C0L,"I followed all of the instructions, installed the software and connected the device. When I tried to capture an image it said ""Scanner is not connected."" I went on the Veho website and saw this problem in the FAQ section. Their solution is to make sure you are using a 2.0 USB port, and preferably one that is on your computer, not a hub. I was already doing that. Then it says sometimes it can't detect your scanner if you have other image capture devices plugged in (other scanners, printers) so I unplugged all of my other USB devices and restarted my computer. Still nothing. I uninstalled the software and re-installed it using the download on their website (instead of the disc that came with my scanner) and it still didn't work. I tried installing on two other computers and it didn't work on those either!If you could use this scanner with the native image capture program on your computer I wouldn't care about this issue at all, but it ONLY works with this software. Either my scanner is defective or (and I think this is more likely since somebody else already left a review saying it doesn't work with Macbook Air) it just doesn't work with macs.

R2Y9QFJEATC2E1,"I am shocked by all the super positive reviews about this printer.  Yes it is easy to set up, but the host of other problems with it make this a printer that is going straight to the thrift store after only using it 5 times.  I simultaneously purchased a Canon imageCLASS LBP6030w Wireless Laser Printer also from Amazon for my office so I can genuinely compare two printers that are both inexpensive.  The Canon is not easy to set up if you have an Apple computer, but in the end far outweighs the Samsung in terms of performance.  Here are the issues with the Samsung:  It gives off crazy amounts of smoke after printing about 10 pages and starts to overheat.  The printer tray, more like an extended post doesn't hold the papers well, so they all collect in a haphazard way.

After hours and on weekends, my hubby and kids use the office for gaming or surfing the internet so I needed a heavy duty chair that would be in constant use.  I decided to try a big and tall chair thinking it would last longer than a standard chair.I was wrong.I've had this chair for one month and the gas lift has already started to fail (from getting up and down constantly maybe?), and the casters are really cheap plastic and break easily.  For a chair that's rated for big and tall, I was surprised the casters are so cheaply made.  The seat of the chair doesn't fit into the bottom snugly so it wiggles around a little -- not so much that it feels unstable, but enough that it's annoying.For my taller hubby, the seat depth is fine, but I'm shorter and it's uncomfortable for me.  I can't sit far back enough to support my back so by the end of the day, my back aches.  If you're going to use it for just a couple of hours a day, I think it's fine.

RZDY9L8SNKD4M,"This item was given to me for my review.The Quartet Stainless Steel Finish Magnetic Dry-Erase Board is a nice sized dry erase board with two pretty powerful post-it magnets. However, the item, in no way, looks like stainless steel, but just like what it is....silver/grey plastic. The magnets for the back of the board are not strong enough to firmly hold the board, and it slides down my fridge if you bump the board at all. I actually DO like the look, but I feel that the product is hampered by its description, which is a bit inflated for the actual product, and by the poor quality magnets that are included for the back. The company would have been better off using the same quality of magnets for the back of the board as they did the post-it magnets. If one does not choose to use the magnets, there is double sided tape that can be applied directly to the wall....with the knowledge that it might take off paint or paper if used that way, but that is just common sense. I think it would be great in a locker, but only if you used better magnets or used the tape because every time you shut the door, it might fall off. The board is useful, and I will use it, but it is not without defects.

R4O3EM87JV2OR,"I was very excited about purchasing the new printer since I had recently gotten an iPad and wanted to be able to directly print from it.  The HP Photosmart Plus Wireless e-All-in-One Printer had received good reviews and the price was right, so I decided to order it.As with all of my previous Amazon purchases, this one came on time.  However, there was something wrong with the power button.  It would only power on maybe once out of every 10 tries.  I contacted HP customer service via e-mail and they gave me a few ideas to see if this could be resolved, such as plugging the printer directly into the wall instead of into a surge protector.  Nothing helped and I needed to return the printer.  This process took nearly 30 e-mail exchanges and an agonizing two weeks to complete.  I eventually spoke with someone in HP customer service who was in either India or Pakistan, but their knowledge of the English language was poor at best.  The problems ranged from not understanding why the old printer needed to be returned, to how I would receive a new one (or a reconditioned one, which I balked at immediately), to whether I would receive an HP gift coupon to purchase a replacement, to how I would return the old printer.As I mentioned, the process took a very frustrating 2 weeks to complete.  But the replacement printer works as advertised, although it is fairly slow to get started (it replaced an HP Deskjet, which was lightning fast in comparison), but doesn't have e-print.So, HP's customer service is truly a dis-service to the company, but if you are lucky enough not to receive a defective printer, you should be quite happy with the printer.

R3URTVKCZSCCP,"First, I use my printer for business, personal documents and graphics. I did a ton of research before picking this printer, which I've had about a year now, and settled on it because of the large format, pages per cartridge, and good reviews. What the hay do people print on this that they are left liking this printer?Print quality - sucks in color. Black & white is fine, but the color is faded regardless of what medium you print on, even when set for ""best"" printing and ""vivid"" coloring. Rich red looks like faded brick. Browns look gray. Everything has a grayish cast, actually. Nothing pops.Prints per cartridge - one of the other major factors I chose this printer for was the touted prints per cartridge. Maybe I could get that many out of cartridge IF IT ACTUALLY USED MORE THAN 2/3 OF THE INK IN THE DARN CARTRIDGE! I bet I get the same or less as comparable machines.Mediums - it SAYS it will print on card stock. Sure, if by ""card stock"" you use nothing over 60 lb. paper. If you use card stock, you know this is basically resume paper. Actual card stock will jam.every.single.time. you hit print for every.single.sheet. And, yes, this means most labels won't feed smoothly either. Excellent. And I for sure can't run fabric through like I could on my HP all-in-one.Paper size - this, unlike most, will print 11x17 large format paper. It will, however, require you to completely withdraw the paper cartridge and pull a dozen parts in various directions to make it big enough. And yes, you'll have to do this same operation, only slightly less complicated, for every different size of paper. THERE IS NO MANUAL FEED with which to print a few envelopes quickly. If you are doing letters, you will have to print the letter, pull out the tray and paper, manipulate the interior, put in the envelopes, replace the tray and THEN finally print the envelope, even if you are only doing one. What.a.pain. Sure you could use labels instead, except that it struggles to print things as thick as labels, remember? Large format also often leaves ink residue in the margins.What IS right with this machine - was relatively easy to set up. Wireless convenience is terrific (note: not compatible with my daughter's alphasmart, so make sure whatever you think you'll be printing from IS compatible). But wireless is in other brands, too, so that's not an advantage specific to this printer. Scanner, fax are both satisfactory.So, if you are debating between this and another brand of printer, pick the other printer. I wish I did.",0,0

R2V3ZVLDBWC3VN,"What I liked very much was the variety of colours in the 20-pack for a super price of $11.00 (not purchased at Amazon this time).  And they were highly rated so when I saw the price I jumped at it.Here is what I didn't like about them:1.  All light colours are darker than the pen indicates.  But to be somewhat fair, the paper quality has a GREAT deal to do with how the colour comes out. For example, I tested the colour on regular paper (your college ruled subject book) and each colour was darker.  Then I coloured in my colouring book and it was 4 shades darker.2.  Significant bleed through on the colouring book page (but none on the college rule book paper).  I believe the book I was using, has overly porous paper and I had to use 2 sheets of paper to keep the bleed from going onto the next colouring subject.  So I tried them on another colouring book with less porous paper and there was still bleed through, but not much - only dots, as opposed to full seepage.3.  They are not smooth feeling - very scratchy.  I would hate to use them to write with for any length of time.  Yet many of the reviews here loved them so much for both writing and colouring.I don't like them and I cannot recommend them for either writing or colouring.  Hope I can find someone who can use them cause 20 pens of colour I can't use...is too much (bummer).",0,0

It would give error signals that the door was open when it wasn't, I would try to print something and it would say it was printing but it clearly wasn't. After messing with it for about 30 minutes it would suddenly start working again and then 2 days later it would do the same thing. So now every time I want to print anything I know its going to take me 30-45 minutes troubleshooting before it will start working again.

R3BXMHR2HR22Y9,"I finally replaced my ancient Handspring Visor with a shiny new Palm TX.  I was excited by the ability to play MP3s, download photos, and view videos as well as be able to take some work documents home with me.  Unfortunatly, what I didn't realize is that to use any of these programs you need to purchase an additional memory card - otherwise you won't have enough memory to do more than one thing. Other things I am not that happy with are: the graffiti is hard to figure out.  After years of writing on my handspring the same graffiti does not work on the TX; The on/off button is too small and needs to be pushed at least twice to turn on; I've had to reset the device because sometimes it doesn't turn on at all. Overall, i'm getting used to it.  I'm liking it more every day until something, like having to reset it, takes me three steps back. Bottom line, if you REALLY need all the things on the TX then go for it, but if not you may want to seriously consider a less expensive device. 9 MONTHS LATER:  I hate this thing.  It often does not turn on and all the fancy programs (even with a memory card) suck the life out of the battery.  Before considering this device go to the Palm website to read the complaints - mostly about the turning on problem.  I do not recommend this device - find something else.  I tried to change this rating to ONE STAR but couldn't.  The only reason I give it that is because the screen is a good size and has great resolution.",0,0

R3MMNRCAUQGZ42,"I have now had the Lexmark Pro901 for almost a year, so I feel very qualified to finally review it at this point. I really want to like this product and give it high marks, but all-in-all this is not a good product and I would strongly steer you away from this printer and maybe even Lexmark products in general. I replaced an old and very well used HP Officejet with this product as an upgrade and hopefully to save on some ink costs.Maddening and frustrating having to deal with this product's printing and communication issues. I had my old HP Officejet for for 7 or 8 eight years and never once had these kind of problems. I will switch back to an HP product after this experience with Lexmark, I just hope that I can save you some of the pain I have had to deal with. Please buy a better product than this one and save yourself the trouble.PROS:-- The black ink cost is cheap and I do like that. I keep my printer set on draft quality and print in black only, so this has helped keep my ink costs down in addition to the cheap black ink price (the color ink, not so cheap).-- The touch screen interface is nice and easy to use, definitely a step up from my old printer.-- Print quality is good for text, photo quality is just average.-- I like the scan quality on this machine better than my old HP.-- It is more compact than my old HP, although most of the machines out there now are about the same size.CONS:-- If you have a phone line connected into the printer for FAX, the printer will come out of sleep mode and make alot of noise (even if it is not a FAX coming in). Then a few minutes later when there is no FAX, the printer goes back into sleep mode with a load starling noise. I finally just disconnected the phone line and plug it in whenever I need to FAX, which is infrequent.-- Setting up the printer to work on your network is not particularly user friendly. But the biggest problem is that I constantly lose communication with the printer over the network. Not just occasionally, but repeatedly. This drives me insane! I have had to reinstall the printer driver software 4 times over the past year to solve this problem.-- The printhead became dirty after about 3 months, so I had to pull it out and clean it off. Otherwise you get black or colored block marks all over your page when you print. I have had to do this several times over the past year to keep the printed page clean. If you are not technically savvy, you may feel uncomfortable doing this yourself although it is a fairly easy procedure. Nonetheless, this never happened on my HP and should not happen on this product either.-- To feed in an envelope to the printer, you must entirely remove the paper tray, pull out all of the paper that currently sits in it, adjust the paper guides in the tray for your envelope, print the envelope, entirely remove the paper tray again, return the paper guides to where they were, put the regular paper back into the tray, and replace the paper tray into the machine. It is a ridiculous setup, the designer should be fired.-- When lifting up the cover of the machine to copy or scan a document, the whole upper section tends to lift off of the machine. I am not sure why this happens, but it feels like you are about to break the top cover off of the machine when lifting it up. I am used to it now and know how to baby it, but it is a very poor design.BIGGEST PROBLEM:My biggest problem occurred after about 5 months of use. Paper started to jam in the printer, it got worse and worse, and then finally would not print at all. After about a week of interfacing with the Lexmark technical team, they decided the machine was broken and replaced my printer.......of course with a refurbished model and not a new printer. That was another instance where I had to uninstall and reinstall the printer driver on every computer. I did not have a printer for about a 2 week period, not even a free ink cartridge or discount coupon on ink for all the troubles with this new printer that had to be returned.",0,0

There are so many things wrong with this printer I don't remember them all.  Let's just say that it has only printed once or twice without any issues.  It will say there's a paper jam.  You check everything there is to check, and:  No paper jam.  After closing it back up it starts printing again from page #1!  The average print time is about 3-4minutes per page.  Yes, you read that right;  3-4 MINUTES per page.  That is the best it's ever performed.  About half of the sheets it spits out are blank.  There are several kinds of ""print errors"".  Hour-long phone calls to the Lexmark overseas operators will help fix the problem for a few minutes.  The next time you print there will be another problem.

RJFC2KYUOZFVQ,"It was great while it worked, but that wasn't for long.The first printer blurred the print and wrinkled the paper while still within warranty.  After spending forever on the phone with Brother, they had me take the ridiculously heavy printer over to a UPS store to ship back to them postpaid.  The replacement arrived, but it had the same wrinkling problem.  This time, after an hour on the phone with Brother, the last rep I talked to told me that my warranty had expired, which contradicted what the rep had told me when I called in about the problems with the original printer.  Bottom line:  I have to drive it to the nearest service center, 1-1/2 hours away, and pay for the repair myself.Lesson learned:  don't believe all the online reviews you read.

R366TRQ0L8TMRE,"OK.  I confess.  I had way too many gel pens before I placed this order, but I was drawn in by all of the glowing reviews!  I've come to consider ColorIt products as being a cut above, so just one more set of pens can't hurt.  Right?Wrong! I wanted to love these pens!  The fact is I don't.  The ink in the glitter pens flows smoothly, and the amount of glitter dispensed is alright.  I've used pens with more glitter and some with less, but all in all the glitter pens are good.  However, it was pretty much downhill from there.  The metallic part of the mostly scratchy metallic pens was definitely understated.  There's no risk of depleting our planet's precious nonrenewable metallic resources with these pens. The neons were bold and bright...and also mostly scratchy.Maybe the gel pen gods are sending me a message, ""You don't NEED any more gel pens!""",0,0

R1QBLG44916H4B,"This paper cutter has no finger guard on the pressure (paper holder) bar.  It is very easy to cut your finger because the pressure guard is also loose and comes off, paper slips, uneven cuts.  I also think it is not really strong enough to cut a folded card (two layers of card stock at once), so the card slips and the cut is wrong.  I have used guillotine cutters for years and never once have I had a problem with cutting my fingers.  I am a very productive crafter so I use the cutters almost every day.  I have a large tonic guillotine and a full size office guillotine.  I wanted a smaller one for my desktop, thinking it would be handier.  In that respect it is.  But after I cut the side of my finger a second time (two separate occasions) when trying to hold a card in place for an even cut, I am trashing it.  It is just past the 30 day return, and I won't pass it on because it just isn't worth knowing the injury it can cause to any user.  I don't often strongly advise people not to buy a product just because I don't like it.  But I do offer that advice for this trimmer.  I like Fiskars products and find their scissors one of the best in quality, longevity and comfort of use, which is why I didn't hesitate to buy this trimmer, I trusted the brand.  Truth told, I never noticed the lack of a finger guard when I got it, my other guillotines have that, but it wasn't something I looked for when I bought them.  I have ordered the tonic small cutter, after I looked to be sure it has the guard.  Also, I have never had paper slip and wasted so much paper, time and effort with the other cutters, so on both cutting and safety this is a ZERO star product.",0,0
R2SN8JWRMP1X0S,"I was a loyal HP printer owner and I still have an old tank, ten years old (820Cse) that refuses to die but it uses a parallel cord and well, it needs to be retired.  These newer HPs that should be so much improved have become throw away units and you should throw them away before you install them and save yourself a lot of trouble.  After I put in new ink cartridges my last one wouldn't calibrate.  So I looked for recommendations for a printer and this Lexmark had high marks.  For me it installed without a hitch.  I now have four computers networked to the Lexmark  printer.  One by USB, two laptops wireless, and a second desktop via DSL network. Now we have the test of time in progress.  Will it last? but so far it works great.Update and downgrade (3/2012): I reinstalled my router and after that I couldn't get the printer to work on my network.  I did not call tech support, ya know, hate the wait and ya gotta be sharp that day to click this and click that, just dread to do it.  But on my primary computer, it still worked fine albeit slow.  The machine will take the time to suck the page back inside to print the back of the page even when there is no back of the page.  One of the big selling points that drew me in was the $4.99 black cartridge.  Well, the printer is designed to trickle in a little color into the black.  I suppose that makes the black blacker.  This is to herd the cattle over with their money to buy the expensive color set.  I always click draft quality and most of the time even click black only, yet somehow the color got all used up, but when the color is out it will not print with the $4.99 black.  The set of three colors go for $52 at Office Depot and the same at Amazon .  I used the HP820 for years with the color cartridge bone dry.  I am gonna try a Brother HL-5340D Laser.

Obviously this is not for glossy photos, but for anything else, it was terrific.The reason I had to give this one star is because I returned it.The reason I returned it is because when scanning single sided documents, scanning duplex documents (which this model does support via the ADF (auto-document-feeder)), printing duplex, and printing on envelopes, there are simply WAY WAY WAY too many paper jams.I tried a few different paper weights and a few different textures (smooth white paper/""textured"" paper/recycled paper), and a few different envelope types.I also triple checked I removed all the ""blue scotch tape"" that usually comes with printers during shipping.It just jammed far too often.  If you end up purchasing this, and don't have those issues, consider yourself very lucky.I would have given this 5 stars if there were no jams, but alas, I had to return it.Amazon made returning this hassle free, and I did NOT have to pay to shipping to return it.",0,0
R7UHQGK5DA0WV,"Very disappointed. Purchased this the last day of July, knowing I was about to run out of the yellow plastic tape. Opened the cartridge package today and the tape is jammed in the cartridge and will not feed. I tried to manually pull out some of the tape, but it jammed even more. You can see the backside of the tape turned up in the slot that allows you to view remaining contents. Cartridges cannons be opened to fix by rewinding correctly. The return window closed 10 days ago. You can see where I attempted to print, but all letters are stacked atop each other.I stayed with the more expensive OEM Dymo brand hoping to avoid issues like this.  Zero stars if I could.If you order in advance, check each one fo a problem when you receive them.",0,0

RDSYKFFI37TSH,"I'd really rather not be giving this phone system a 2-star rating because it actually has quite a few snazzy features which work well. Unfortunately, the main feature that differentiates it from similar - and less expensive - phones is a washout (at least for my personal home - yours may vary). Specifically, the exterior doorbell which sends either a snapshot or video feed of the person at your door is all but useless during the daytime, sending only a black silhouette image (hence ""The Shadow"" reference) with a blown-out bright background. There's no possible way of identifying who is at your door unless they have a really distinctively shaped head.The night vision works better - lighting up a face in almost complete darkness and, as a bonus, giving your visitor that ""Blair Witch"" quality that everyone enjoys on a dark and stormy night. But seriously, if your main concern is seeing faces at night then you may be well served by this phone/doorbell combination.Again, I've got no problem with the phone's other functions, all of which seem to work well: answering machine, intercom function between handsets, speakerphone, etc. For that matter, the audio doorbell function works well - your visitor pushes the doorbell, and it will sound wherever your handsets are (useful for me because my existing doorbell can't be heard in my home office). But that feature alone doesn't make it worth the bother of installing the external unit...and being haunted by the glowing (albeit pretty) screens on the telephone handsets reminding you of a feature which doesn't work.If V-tech finds a way to solve the backlighting problem (maybe a quick LED flash?) then they'll have a pretty nice product here.",0,0

Obviously we paid only about £7 so I guess it is natural that they won't be the same quality as the higher priced ones we have bought in the past.  We have kept them rather than have hassle of the returns process but will keep them just as a reserve in case we run out of decent ones.Amazon really needs to find a way that buyers can differentiate between items from different sellers for reviews.

RCTDPU34ZLZ3H,I recently purchased this item not knowing what to expect like many other readers. Luckily it is available from Amazon with free postage return because you are likely to want to return it. I initially persevered starting off with scanning 110mm negative. The results were very poor. Even on the highest resolution scan the results looked like something from a John Bull printing press from the 1960's. The results with the 35mm negatives were better and occasionally reasonably acceptable. I consider that I wasted a lot of time scanning in negatives that I feel I will have to do all over again. One other really annoying thin about this device is the fact that the light has an inconsistent spread. In the centre of the slide you can see a dark circle and around the corners the scanned copy is brighter. You can notice this particularly when reviewing the slide window without a slide in place. Save yourself the time and go for something that has consistently good reviews. Bear in mind that you do not know how good the scans could be with a better unit. I will put a comment on Amazon if I find one which performs well.,0,0

R12A2ZYRM4CVN4,"This printer has been nothing but problems so I advise to STAY AWAY. A colleague of mine has another printer similar to this one and it worked great but not only have I not been able to connect to the printer wirelessly at work, it only worked at home on a smaller wireless network, the USB cord I bought does not work either after I reset it several times, on my computer and the printer itself. The CD supplied DOES NOT have support or a driver for MAC OSX 7 (Lion) and I had to dig through the Brother website myself to go through three different installations before one worked.

This Brother printer (like a black and white laser I also tried months ago) uses a ton of AMPS when it heats up causing an undue load on my house wiring.  (The monochrome Brother actually caused an APC BackUPS to fail and blew my fuses).  So I took it back and bought an Epson inkjet instead.

RHCXM60A7ECPX,"This chair is okay, but not great, I wouldn't even say it's good.  The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because the customer service behind it is good, which I had to use three times in the first year I had it because of broken parts, but more on that to come.Pros:The chair is comfortable to sit in for long periods.  The nice high back and adjustable headrest are perfect for us tall guys.  The adjustable height of the chair is fantastic as well.  At it's full height I can just touch my toes to the ground.  Usually most chairs my feet are still very firmly flat on the floor at full height.  The wide base and arms make sitting in this chair easy and doesn't press against the outsides of my thighs.  The customer service and warranty replacement folks save this chair.The cons:The base and wheels are terrible.  Terrible is putting it mild..they are deplorable.  I am a big guy, which is why I purchased this chair, but I am well within the advertised limits of the chairs capabilities.  I am a little over 6 foot tall and a little over 300 pounds, so I should fit easily in a chair rated for a 350 pound weight limit.  The nice wide seat and arms are great, but the base, the foundation of the chair itself, makes this not worth buying.  In the first year that I had it I had to have the wheels replaced twice and the base replaced once.  The main body of the base is very strong and sturdy, made of metal construction, however the wheels are plastic casters.  For a chair rated for larger people, you might thing they would be a little more durable, but no, just plastic.  The brackets that the wheels pop into on the base are also less than ideal.  At one point I had one the brackets bust off while I was sitting in the chair, leaving me with only 4 working wheels left...hence the replacement base.  Lastly, the edges of the base are very sharp.  When sitting in the chair if you move your foot or roll the chair and hit your heel it hurts like a banshee and on more than one occasion has drawn blood.The short story is, if you are looking for a reliable chair, this is not the one to buy, however if you are looking for a chair that may very well break on you a time or two but has great customer service behind it, then you might consider it.  Personally I think it's great that they have such good service, however I would have preferred my chair to hold up so that I would not have had to contact them in the first place.",0,0
R27W504QKANPBX,"I love a good pen, and I have a lot of them.  Never satisfied with using the same one for too long, I am always looking for something better.  The many good reviews on this pen, and this brand itself got me interested in it, so I bought one.  In all honesty, I think the higher cost for this pen is because of the fancy box it came in, and not the pen itself.  No offense to Parker, or Parker users, but if you put this pen in a pile of cheap pens, most would have a hard time telling the difference.  I also found that it is too small for my hand, making it hard to get a good grip on it to write...it wants to slide through my grip as I write.  Apparently there is a niche for this kind of pen, so, as the saying goes -  ""different strokes for different folks"" (no-pun intended).",0,0

I doubt this will last the year.  The cover is pretty but thin.  I gave this 2 stars because the concept is a good one, but the construction could have been much better for the price.  Not a good value.  You'd have to be very careful with how you use this so the pockets don't rip.  I reinforced the outside edges with washi tape, but there's no way to reinforce the punched holes.

We returned one of the machines straight away (and had it been up to me, I would have returned both...).  Now, less than two years after purchase, the performance of the second machine has deteriorated to the point that all text is extremely blurry and printed pages emerge from the machine covered with various ink shadows and smears in different places on the page.

R2F58VJJAGOWLZ,"I REPEAT. Do not buy this vinyl!  I absolutely love my Silhouette Cameo and have had it for about a year now.  I've always purchased Silhouette's premium vinyl and was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to use.  Since my first venture with vinyl, I've used it on everything, walls, plates, mailboxes, family member's walls, everything, really!I needed some new white vinyl and decided to head to Amazon only to realize they now only offer ""matte"" or ""permanent"" vinyl.  After some research I found that Silhouette no longer offers Premium vinyl which could be used for pretty much anything (I have it on our walls and my mailbox).  For indoor use with this newer vinyl, I should purchase the ""matte"" type. Well I did and now I am NOT happy.  I did a larger typography mural in our laundry room.  The vinyl cut well and I was able to take off the negative part easily. As I was doing this I even said to my husband how I was nervous to purchase this vinyl due to all the negative reviews but so far I really liked it.Well, folks, I SPOKE TOO SOON. Putting this awful vinyl on our wall was a HUGE pain in the butt!  It literally took me almost a half an hour to get it to even come off the transfer and even longer to make sure all the parts of the letters stayed on the wall! Every time I walk by the piece, I find myself pushing the letters back on the wall.It's so frustrating that I spent all the this time designing the piece, put my money on a silhouette product that I would have assumed was great, due to the brand name, only to be frustrated and having to buy new vinyl and restart the whole process!The photos attached are of the letters not staying adhered to the wall.

R33FXKEQC6W8FU,"Overall impression: Would not buy again, but would try a different brand on Amazon. These are not comparable in quality to well known brands, but somewhat less expensive. Nice carrying case.Cons:About 1/3 of the pens are scratchy on paper from first use until I take out the replaceable cartridge and replace it with a new one, which is often not scratchy (luck of the draw?)Ink flow skips approximately 25% of the time in all of the pens, which means more than 1/4 of the time I am coloring, the pens are skipping or I am slapping them against my palm to get the ink to flow down to the tip so I can start coloring again. This happens with new refills and old ones, but more frequently with used cartridges, of course.Cost is high in comparison to similar type pens on AmazonColor names often are highly misleading--always test the colors, as mine did not come with a color coded sheet to show you what the color actually looks like on paper, so I have scribbles everywhere and finally just went through and made my own color coded sheet for referencePros:Huge variety of colors (but an awful lot of greens and purples in comparison to some other colors, with several of the greens looking pretty much the same, in my opinion)Carrying case is very handy (my favorite feature)Refills are great/necessary, especially since I've had to replace 1/3 of the cartridges almost immediately on use (but I'm paying for the refills, so I don't know if this is actually a pro??? I guess this is a con, because I had to throw out full cartridges because of the scratchy tips, so 1/3 of the ""refills included"" ended up being used immediately, which makes the set cost more, not less)Variety of metallics, neons, and glitters (do they make a solid set? That would be nice too)*Picture caption: that leaf is colored with the green peridot pen. As you can see, there are two leaf segments that are very scratchy looking. When that happened, I wiped off the tip of the pen, tried it on discard paper, and when I saw that it wasn't getting better, I replaced it with a refill. The rest of the leaf is with the new pen refill. But now I don't have a refill with the peridot color and had to throw away a basically unused cartridge because of the scratchy tip. As another reviewer said, this process of scratchy and skipping is extremely annoying when I am trying to engage in a relaxation coping skill. It is so annoying that I stopped coloring just now to come and write this review.",0,0

My printer won't recognize the ink cartridge, but I was able to print some pages by holding down the power button and cancel button. However, that is no longer working. It won't print anything now. No ink is coming out. So, I got a handful of pages out of the first cartridge that I bought. I bought a total of 3. The 2nd cartridge is doing the same with holding the power button down and cancel button. But it is printing in a really weird manner. The pages are illegible. So, 2nd cartridge is a failure.

RNYIQ5NBLU65F,"I've been a Palm user for the last 12 years. I decided to go for the TX after my Palm Pilot needed a retirement (case was coming apart...still worked swell). Switching over was easy. Nice screen graphics, and it functionally had more than I would use. And...it worked great...for the first 3 days. At the end of the 3rd day, it would not turn on. I did everything tech support suggested (spent HOURS with them). After more research, it appears the Palm quality has disappeared. Tech support insisted I send it back for a (refurbished) replacement. I guess it pays to read and believe in the user reviews. They made this unit sound risky and it sure was for me. I'm not willing to go thru several rounds of replacements with these folks. I travel and luckily the failure happened at home and not in a meeting on the other side of the country. I am disappointed and getting my money back. Tech support is in India and I had a LOT of trouble getting them to understand they needed to think beyond their script.

I had a Parker fountain pen (old Parker 45, made in UK) for about 15 years, which was such a great pen. This pen is just a total disappointment.

R25OSGE3CJHKAO,Please read the negative reviews and take them mind. I did not with regrets. I like to buy American when possible but this product will leave you in a lurch. I tried all the remedies to make this product work on my 5895 mfc brother printer. After no success I had to buy the brothers 61 and 65 cartridges. Worked perfect right off! No I did not contact manufacturing. No I did try to contact Amazon. I wasted enough time with this product and decided to take time to warn people off this product.

R363WA4927CSOS,"I have to believe that the majority of the positive reviews were written by people who didn't bother to use this printer for more than a single test print after they took it out of the box.  After having one for several months now, I wish that I had the cash to turn this one into a pinata, or perhaps a boat anchor.The good:  This printer looks quite stylish for an all-in-one machine, and it has a lovely full color control panel.The bad: Literally everything else.Print quality - The prints are often streaky, with streaks appearing in any color, midpage, and irregularly.  It's not an issue of having a problem with just one color.  The printheads clog regularly, requiring repeated cleanings before the machine will print again.Ink consumption - Amazingly terrible.  This goes through a $10 black cartridge in 50-70 draft quality pages of text, and a $20 ""double sized"" cartridge in fewer than 100.  Color consumption is lower for me, as I rarely print images, but when I've printed larger color pictures the ink levels drop incredibly fast.Wifi - This printer goes offline regularly (every 10 minutes or so) and won't wake up for a new print job.  It must be manually reactivated each time.I'm kicking myself for ever having purchased this piece of junk, and I can't believe that HP ever offered it for sale in the first place.  I've never bought a printer that was not made by HP.  This clunker is going to change that.",0,0

R2W80SL86W9K4U,"I purchased these cartridges right after buying some HP cartridges with the intention that I would use them when my new HPs ran out.  When the time came, I installed the black first.  It initially worked fine, but after a few uses the ink began to gum up the print heads (HP ink didn't do this).  I had to run multiple cleaning cycles to try to get them clean - so many so that I need to change out the color cartridges just from cleaning.  Unfortunately, the Kingway color cartridges did not work at all.  The printer did not even recognize them as being installed.  So, not only is the ink cheap so that it gums up your printer, the chip set is cheap and only works some of the time or is incompatible with the printers for which it was designed.If that were not enough to steer you away, after my purchase, the company immediately begin contacting me about writing a review.  I am not a regular poster of reviews - I'm just a normal shopper.  But holy cow did they want that review!  The frequency and tone of the communications was really unlike anything I have otherwise ever experienced with a vendor - and I have bought a lot of stuff online and offline.

R2XPUUPI11NGBA,"Got this as a 'gift' from my boss to use labeling stuff. He wasted his money on this. Looks like I'm the first person who isn't a Vine reviewer though.I've been working (fighting?) with this for about 2 weeks now. It worked OK when I had it hooked up via USB, but I wanted to use it as a wifi printer so it's out by the copy machine (about 12 feet from the primary AP antenna). It goes to sleep and won't reconnect to the wifi on demand, you have to turn it off and on to get the wifi to connect and the printer to show up on the program.The program. Oh, what a piece of junk the program is. Even if the printer is hooked up to the wifi (and I can see it on the DHCP client page), most of the time it won't show as connected in the program. Trying to create a label is a chore, too - it only inputs text horizontally even if you need it to be vertical. Label choices are hard coded into the system so you really can't do a custom label without jumping through all sorts of hoops. When it works, it works, but that's few and far between. Oh, and the printer has to have the name ""Leitz Icon"" or the program crashes when you try to print.Labels look OK when you can get it all figured out, but you're still limited on sizes. Even on a continuous roll like it comes with, you can't make a 1/2"" tall label - it claims the margins are too small. It won't operate as a true WYSIWYG label printer since it resizes text on the fly.Bottom Line: Don't buy this if you're expecting something that actually works. This will do its best to make you tear out your hair and gnash your teeth, all while laughing at how stupid you are since you can't print out the label even though your printer is definitely connected. Don't buy this if you want to use it on wifi only. Don't buy this unless you have money literally burning a hole in your pocket (like if it were covered in fluoric acid or something that you can't be exposed to).",0,0

R14JYC6S6J4ZM9,"The plastic wheel just busted, which is why I'm writing this review now.  Prior to that, this thing never rolled very good.  I had to lift myself out of the chair and push with some force to get myself around.  Yes, people who sit in computer chairs can likely use exercise... but it's not supposed to be like this.  The wheels are very bad.The arm rests were fair at best.  Too little padding.  And yes, they got a little loose.It was quite comfortable from the start.  But within a few days, I was online buying a back rest.  The headrest was a must have for me and this was ""ok"" - but not great.  Feels cheap and wobbles.  But your head doesn't need that much support, so it worked.  But it wasn't really well thought out.  So within a few days... I bought a headrest pad to attach (via a strap) so that I didn't have to throw my head so far back to relax my neck.But the chair with these simple, cheap mods, was ok -- especially since the chair was only $200.  That was my plan from the start.The seat padding.  It was great at first.  But I can feel it starting to go -- and the hard base is starting to feel through.  But it's still fine.  So overall I can't complain.  Yet.  The chair is only a year old.  If I had this chair for two years (I won't) then I might be singing a different tune.  Another thing -- it's heavy.  Very heavy.  More than I thought anyway.I gave it two stars (would be three if the wheel didn't just bust!) because this thing -- with my modifications -- was light years better than my chair at the office -- which has no head rest and the worst back support I've ever had.  So, this chair was heaven to sit in after work.  But with it only lasting a year -- because of its questionable construction and design issues -- I have to knock it down a bit.  I thought I'd get 3 or 4 years out of it.  Nope.It was only $200 and I didn't expect $1,000 quality.  I knew going in that spending only $200 for instrument that has such a crucial job as holding you up and supporting you for hours -- that I'd be buying another chair soon.

RWYT9OKIHSBU5,"Beware this printer if you only have a Chromebook.  In order to get this printer to print via the cloud, you have to first connect it to a PC and update the firmware.  For someone like me, who only has the Chromebook and no other tech available, this is not a possibility.Here is an excerpt from the end of my lengthy customer service live chat with Samsung this morning:Kevin P: Have you updated the firmware from the Samsung website through a windows PC?Visitor: no. I don't have a windows pc. I have a chromebook.Kevin P: As we are unable to print from cloud printing, we need to update the firmware and we need a windows PC to update the firmware of the printer to print wirelessly from cloud printing.Visitor: so Samsung sold me a ""cloud ready"" printer advertised to work with my specific laptop that is not, in fact, cloud ready, and will not, in fact, work with my laptop without the presence of an additional computer?Kevin P: I understand your concern, we need an additional computer only to setup the wireless cloud printing on the printer.Kevin P: Once we setup the printer, we print wirelessly without any additional computer.Visitor: well, I have no other computer. Are there no other options for me?Kevin P: I am afraid, there are no options available as we are getting the error message while trying to print wirelessly and we need to upgrade the firmware using a windows PC to solve the issue.So there you have it folks.

Had to lie on top of the arms to get the screws to line up into the holes in the back and front. When done the back didn't line up with the stripes on the bottom.I noticed right away that there was no way the back would go straight up and down. When a person sat in it and leaned back a little there was a noticable ""ding"" sound coming from the chair shaft whenever a person sat up straight.

R39HAGA4OSRQEZ,"I bought this slide scanner (on January 9, 2013) on the basis of other Amazon reviews. Received it promptly (as Amazon always does!), installed it according to the directions, and started scanning some of our hundreds of slides (almost all Kodachrome) from some years back. Viewing the slides on a slide sorter device showed them to be totally intact in color and lighting. When I began scanning them on the Veho scanner, however, the colors were badly distorted to the warm side, the lighting allowed for flaring (too bright on objects in the foreground),and focus/sharpness was lacking. Now, I bought this scanner because of its speed which is great. Then I scanned the same slides with my good old Epson scanner which is much slower, and found that the colors, lighting, focus, etc. were a faithful rendition of the slides themselves. Thus, I decided to return this device (Veho VFS-002m) to Amazon for a refund. Perhaps I just received a poor quality unit, but since I'm retired I decided I will just have to take the time to scan my slides with my old Epson.

R5RZ7Q0XJDCOY,"Summary: Could be very good, but marred by repeated spooling and printhead problems.I replaced a broken Canon all-in-one I'd been very satisfied with. I was initially attracted by the features and low ink cost.The inherent pros and cons, before the problems I'll describe below, are:PRO:1. Very low black and white ink cost. (Color ink is no bargain.) Additional free cartridges if you buy from Lexmark's online store.2. Duplex (two-sided) printing quality as good as simplex. The Canon all-in-ones lighten the print to a grayish tone when you request duplex, to avoid smearing the ink or getting it on the inside rollers.3. The touch screen user interface is well-designed.4. The included ABBYY OCR software is very accurate.5. Five-year warranty, if you register online.CON:1. No duplex *scanning* (the higher end Canons do this).2. No alternate paper feed. If I load a single sheet of thicker photo paper on top of regular 24lb inkjet paper, the paper picker invariably picks up two sheets. I must remove any other paper before loading photo paper. In addition, very thick photo paper does not make the sharp U-turn inside the printer easily, and I may get banding due to misalignment.3. Paper tray is difficult to close.4. The TWAIN control panel has a limited number of settings, compared with, say, the Canon equivalent.5. PDF scanning produces uncompressed PDF files, which are very large, even for bitonal (B&W) scans. I bought an inexpensive third-party product, Softi ScanWiz, to get around this problem.6. Scanning to different types of files when using ""Advanced Scan..."" is not intuitive. After scanning, you give a filename in which to save the scan. Depending on the file type (.jpg, .txt, etc.), different software will be run. For instance, choosing a .txt file will run the OCR software.Now the problems:SPOOLING FAILURES:On both Windows 7 32-bit and 64-bit, on two different computers, print jobs sometimes stop spontaneously before completion. The progress bar displayed on-screen stops progressing. Any further printing attempts just queue up. The usual cure is to start a Command Prompt, right-clicking to ""Run as administrator"", and then do ""NET STOP SPOOLER"", and ""NET START SPOOLER"". Occasionally even this does not work and I must reboot. I have reinstalled and updated the drivers and firmware faithfully, to no avail. This problem happens irregularly several times a week.I have had multiple exchanges with Lexmark tech support about this, and recently had an on-line remote-access tech-support session, which found no issues that could be causing this problem. Later I found Lexmark knowledgebase article SO6683 (search on the Lexmark site), which describes the lxec_device stopping spontaneously. That's what's happening to me.PRINTHEAD FAILURES:Printhead issues are described repeatedly in other Amazon reviews. After about six months of initial satisfactory use, I started having wide swathes of cyan ink on printouts. Lexmark very readily sent me a new printhead and a new set of ink cartridges. Printing was fine for a couple of months, but now I find that after only a day or less of non-use, yellow and cyan do not print unless I do a printhead cleaning first. I probably need yet another new printhead.At this point, I am researching new printers. I have asked Lexmark for my money back or to replace the printer with one of their brand new comparable Pro915 or Pro715 printers. These new models have new cartridge part numbers and presumably a newer printhead design. Lexmark's tech support is responsive, and they are honoring the five year warranty, but it's clear there is an inherent design flaw in this printer. Interestingly, the new Pro915 and Pro715 have only 1-year warranties.",0,0

What this awful shipping translates to is this:Higher product price or shipping price.Lower Prime availability.Longer shipping times.Increased chance of shipping damage (I have had two incidents) (edit: 4), not only because the box is bigger but the bins have greater durability when stacked inside each other.Also there is never any packaging inside the box.Fix the shipping!!As for the bins themselves - great bins. Very modular, clear, easily washable (may warp in the dishwasher), decently water resistant, fit paper perfectly. Will probably crack if you drop it. I take a pair of snips and cut off all the alignment tabs that keep the lids together when they’re stacked, that way I can fill the bins higher.Edit: it's been like 4 years since I started buying these, and I've amassed at least 60. They still haven't fixed the shipping, and that goes for any size of this type of bin. Even Walmart receives them stacked, I've seen them unloading. I don't understand. Oh well... if you are a organizational perfectionist, these are the bins for you.Also, I realized the ""alignment tabs"" are actually just remnants of the plastic extrusion process, they don't align anything. There's no harm in cutting them off! Use flush cutters. The plastic does usually get hairline cracks when you do this but I haven't had any problems or broken lids from it, even with 4 year old bins that I frequently drop. You could probably cut and sand them with a Dremel if you're worried about cracks. Kind of obnoxious they leave them at this price point. Finally, expect the exact color of the clips to change, I have a few distinct blues over the years despite always buying the same one. Target has green ones.",0,0

RT1ELVCI0UWMI,"I purchased these poly mailers against my husband's advice and I have to admit it was a huge mistake. These are way thinner than I anticipated (which was my mistake I should have read the description) so I'm not sure how well they will hold up during transit. They also smell dreadful (think of plastic mixed with ash tray or someone smoked into it). I guess you get what you pay for as I purchased these for the quantity/price versus the usual ValueMailers Poly Mailers my husband orders for me. To clarify the two star rating - Even though they disclosed the thickness (so I can't really complain that they are thin), they did, however, describe the item as ""durable, professional, private and secure"". The material itself does not make me think of any of those descriptions as I had to throw away my first poly mailer because my nail scratched through it!

R3S3ZM1QMD3IHB,"I was surprised by the nearly all positive reviews posted, but I would have been fairly positive before mine broke after about 40 days.  I used an m515 for years with no problems and liked the TX for its improved screen, color, memory, and mp3 capabilities.  In short, it was time to upgrade to a modern product.But after 40 days in which the on/off switch seemed to work intermittently, it failed altogether and I had to send it back to Palm for repair.  LET THE BUYER BEWARE that if your TX fails, you will send it at your own expense to Palm for repair.  So if a 10% increase in your overall cost is ok, as well as doing without your device for a week or two, then this thing might be ok.  But for me, a product that fails at all has already earned a bad review, and the manufacturer should own up to the responsibility of having sold defective merchandise and, for the sake of their reputation, should bear all costs for the repair.  So this alone warrants a poor rating from me and in fact I will never buy another Palm product.From comments posted elsewhere, both on this site and on the Palm support site, I gather that there have been a lot of devices sold with this defective on/off switch.  I have also read about broken screens and frequent device resets, though I haven't experienced that (yet).  The TX is incompatible with a couple of applications I have with the older m515.One of my major interests in the device was as an mp3 player, reasoning that with an add-on 4GB memory card it would be comparable to an ipod nano but also have the Palm OS.  I asked Palm support if a 4 GB card would work and they responded that they had not tested any.  I believe this answer to be baloney, but if not it's a poor report on Palm anyway.  I found out elsewhere that the TX is one of two Palm devices supporting FAT32 drives and would therefore work with large memory cards, so I bought one and it does in fact work just fine.  I suspect Palm won't tell anybody this because it would undercut sales of their more expensive and ill-considered LifeDrive.",0,0

I ended up using an EXPO eraser and a small amount of EXPO cleaning spray to the clean up the smudges. FYI, I recommend purchasing EXPO brand pens and an EXPO brand eraser if you have a WipeErase notebook. EXPO pens worked much better than Staedtler's pens, and the EXPO pen's ink was much easier to erase. Two stars for the Staedtler pens because they write well, but the erasers are worthless.",0,0

ROQS2ZALANDB5,"Just know that I am a little ticked that I have to give it one star, because it doesn't even deserve that.Here is my story. I get this thing from a friends mother who won it in a contest. It was brand new. Was given to me for my birthday.I have been building and working with PC's for over 12 years now, and never in my life have I used a worse printer. This thing was garbage from the start. Here is what I encountered with this thing:- First off, there are two installations that you do at the same time, the one on the PC, and the one on the printer itself.-Never printed anything. Would load the paper, try to test print, and it would give me an error that there is no paper in the tray. There clearly is.-Upon further inspection, and trying to get the paper in the right spot, I try again only for it to tell me that there is a paper jam._Frustrated, I pull the paper out and try to get it in there good. Try and print and get an error (0x000161 or some thing like that) and now I have to power it off and on again. Mind you I am still in the setup phase. About 20 minutes have passed. Getting very frustrated.-Reset the machine, forced to go thru the ENTIRE setup again, which requires me to answer a ton of questions about where I live and stuff. Was getting asked all of this from the printer. That was a first. By the way, the touch screen is not as cool as it looks. It is actually quite cheap and doesnt respond to touch very well.-Finally get the machine back to the test print page. At this point I have wasted about 45 minutes. I am on the test print just on the printer, have not even got to the part where I install the drivers. I try the test again and SUCCESS! IT PRINTED OU..... wait. What? Why is the printer throwing blank paper out after the print? I power it down to stop since the machine does not have the red X displayed to cancel. Says it is powering down, yet continues to throw paper out. Figure it is a phase. After about 100 sheets thrown at me, I have to pull the power cord to make it stop. Great.... Time to start the initial setup AGAIN! FROM THE BEGINNING!- Give up. Wait till morning. I go to store and buy all new paper. I figure I should at least try that.- Does not work. Paper is either ""missing from main tray"", paper is ""jammed"", or error 0x0001662e or something like that pops up. Finally prints a page without any problems (though I used just one piece and fed it into the printer by hand). It has now been a day and a half, and I have not even installed the drivers, but I will finally get to now!- thinking I just fixed whatever issue the printer was having, I go to install the drivers. Not only do I get the drivers, but I also get all this other bloatware installed on my PC! Thanks Hp for giving me shit that I never ever wanted....- Get the drivers installed. It has been two days and I feel that I am finally done. I test it by printing from the PC. No success. All the issues previously stated are occurring. Still.- Try all over again, in quick mode. Does not work. Gave up. Boxed the machine back up. About to take it to the garage with my baseball bat. Give the damn thing some Office Space treatment.Overall I spent about 3 days trying to get this printer to do the simplest task its made to do, print. It failed in every way possible. This thing was a disaster from the start, so bad that I never got to use it once. Maybe I am one lucky SOB, but this is the first time that I have had a product let me down as much as this printer did. Worst of all, it was a gift, from a prize win, so there is no return. Who would want it back anyway? Needless to say, do not buy this product. It is hot garbage. A waste of money. Lies about stating it is a printer when it is actually a potato. Potatoes do not print, they are potatoes.**  TO ANY HP EMPLOYEE THAT MAY READ THIS: YOUR PRODUCTS HAVE SLIPPED SO POORLY THAT HP WILL BECOME THE FIRST COMPANY THAT I WILL NEVER BUY FROM AGAIN.

It is a square letter or The length divided by height is less than 1.3 or more than 2.5.""The result is that what you can ship your disks for depends on your local post office.

I use the Parker 51 that my parents gave me for Christmas in 1964 for writing notes, more or less daily, but I am probably on my 4th bottle of Parker Quink over a period of more than 40 years.I give two stars for the attractive color of the ink.",0,0

But the most aggravating thing I have encountered is that most of the time when I put in a new black cartridge (HP genuine) , it won't print black !!! The level shows ""full"" and cartridges are aligned, the print heads are cleaned, I have cycled power and nothing I do will get it to print black!! After a day or so, while continuing to try printing a test page, it usually starts printing black again. No rhyme or reason why it finally worked. Just trying to drive me crazy. I will be buying a new printer today and will never trust HP again for printers. Hate this printer!",0,0

R32P68SS4FXTDC,"This printer works as a normal printer/scanner/copier, BUT has HP software limitations that makes the E-Printing almost useless!  I will break this review into three sections; 1st e-printing, 2nd customer support, and 3rd regular printer functions (printer, scanner, & copier).1.  E-Printing: 1 out of 5 starsNEGATIVE - HP software only allows you to send your photo to ONE printer.  If you send the photo to two or more printers at once, no one gets the photo.  So if you are interested in sending photos to several relatives or friends on a regular basis then currently HP printers are not the product for you.NEGATIVE - HP server limits emails to 5 MB size.  So double check your file size of your photos.  We have two point and shoot cameras, one is 5 megapixels & other is 10 megapixels. Using these cameras we can only send 1-2 photos per email.  We also have a digital DSL camera, but most of our RAW files are over 5 MB and need to have the file size reduced to work with HP limits.2.  Customer Support: 0 out of 5 starsNEGATIVE - Spent 40 minutes on the phone being jumped from department to department on HP's customer service line to be told that HP does not have any customer support set up for USA, only for international services....3.  Regular Printer Functions: 5 out of 5 starsPositive - Printer quality is great, the photo quality matches what you get from stores.  Scanner & copier both work, but have lower resolution than printer output.",0,0
R2PYB60TYF8LX8,"Printed two pages with it.  Black ink now so faint as to be unreadable.  Guess one gets what one pays for - will go back to the expensive HP ink - at least it actually works!Company contacted me immediately after I left a poor review and tried to help me make this work.  Sent me a 2nd full set of cartridges, including two new black ones.  I spent 7 hours yesterday trying to make this work.  Apparently, the black ink is a known problem - HP does something to make it not work - other colors work just fine.  Too bad - wanted something far less expensive than the HP ink.  Company was very, very helpful and followed up - it's really HP's fault.  I don't know what would happen if I bought an HP black cartridge - not sure I want to spend more money to find out if that would ""fix"" the problem, or if the non-HP ink ruined the printhead.",0,0
R3OY5Y8QOUN2RH,"Unfortunately I was not able to get this product to work.As some other reviewers have noted, this item is a HUGE power drain.  I initially set it up in my home office excited to see what it could do.  5 seconds after turning it on it short circuited my office.  Thinking I might have overloaded the room with too many devices I unplugged basically everything but my pc and the printer ... turned on the printer same result.  Rinse, repeated several more times--same result.As was noted in other reviews, it is simply ridiculous that 1 such device draws so much power.  Just fyi, I'm set up with a pc, Samsung printer, scanner, cannon color printer, laptop, paper shredder, router/modem, 2 external hard drives and monitor in my office.

R3GMX71T808KFK,I bought the Palm TX because my Tungston wouldn't hold a charge any longer. I have been a long time user of Palm ad thought that the TX might have some good features.  My first Palm TX wouldn't turn on even after recharging it several times and soft and hard re-setting it.  A two hour wait for Palm tech support (when the voice said only a five minute wait) didn't help my mood much.  Tech support told me what I already knew--the product was defective. I returned it to Amazon and asked for a replacement hoping to have a different experience. This time the Palm charged but after it charged the screen went blank.  Again tech support gave the same advice--which I already knew and finally told me to just charge it for 24 more hours (of course I knew that wouldn't make much difference) so now after another 24 hour charge I am returning the TX to Amazon and asking for a refund.  I think I am finally finished with Palm after reading all of the negative reviews for their products.,0,0

R3JSUK8B4O9Y5F,"Update below.This is a great little scale for weighing all types of things in the kitchen.  I mostly use it for making soap but use it for general kitchen use and making lotions and other uses.  My one major complaint is the auto-off feature.  It is not customizable and you can't shut it off.  I often have to start over measuring things as it shuts off after a very short amount of time (supposedly 2 minutes but I think it is a lot shorter than that).  It would be really nice to just have a button or toggle to just turn the auto shut-off off.  I don't care if it eats up batteries.  They are cheap and my time is not.And I have to second what some other reviewers have said, the buttons are way to shiny and they are hard to make out in regular light.  I can't really tell what one button says from the other one and it is a little frustrating.  They could make them way more readable and it would make the scale much more usable.But I have tried several other scales and this beats the other ones hands-down.  Don't let the small size fool you.  It is more accurate than much larger and more expensive one.  Maybe much more expensive lab scales might do a better job, but for this price, you can't get a better value.UPDATE:  ONLY LASTED A FEW MONTHS AND I DIDN'T EVEN USE IT THAT OFTEN.

RKEFAR0C0HD57,"Good product, but questionable software practice, and horrible customer service.Bought the printer a few days ago to replace an old black and white Brother printer, installed the driver and software suite immediately, and found it printing and copying properly.But once I started to try the scanning function, issue arose: the Nuance PDF Professional software originally installed on my computer (for the Brother ADS1500W scanner  I bought in February 2014) was gone!  It is replaced with Nuance PDF Viewer Plus, which lacks the scanning function and many editing functions of the PDF Professional. I do a fair amount of scanning and PDF editing for kids' school work and record keeping, so the downgrading is a severe penalty to me.Unable to find the scanner software installation disk, I turned to Brother customer service for help.  I asked whether a replacement scanner software installation disk could be mailed to me.  The answer was no.  Rather, I was advised that I need to purchase the software disk by calling a telephone number.  Disappointed, I made the request again and made sure that the customer service representative understands that the uninstallation of PDF Professional was not my fault, and Brother should not have done that without my informed consent, and doing so amounts to taking away my license to the PDF Professional.  I informed the esteemed representative that I would have to share my negative experience here if the issue is not addressed properly.I was then flabbergasted to receive the following:""We understand your frustration; however, when new Brother Machines are installed and it has updated software, the updated software is installed as well. Unfortunately, we are unable to replace the installation CD free of charge as it was not damaged or found to be defective upon purchase.

R3AWPOQL1U1WR6,"This is so disappointing! It's so nice looking. As other reviewers mentioned, the back and drawer bottoms are not real wood, although they seem reasonably sturdy. However, the nails won't go through them. This is partly because the nails bend instantly; of the many included in the package, about half of them were unusable. I had to duct tape the backs of the drawers and the bottom back of the cabinet - in addition to adding pieces to the bottom because it wasn't long enough to meet the back. The pre-drilled holes are in the wrong places. It's hard to tell in this photo, but the bar in the middle that's supposed to be extra support is uneven, it tilts both vertically and diagonally, as in there's about an inch difference where each side sits from the side, and an inch difference measured from the floor as well.

RSWU27OJZVJFY,"I was really pleased when I first installed the cartridges. The print quality was good enough for at-home casual printing. When you needed or simply wanted a hard copy of something that didn’t need to be high quality, it seemed these inks were the perfect solution. However, when you don’t use your printer for a period of time and then decide to print, the cartridges perform horribly! The ink seems to bleed and you can hardly discern what you intended to print. The print heads have to be cleaned before each each use (assuming you don’t use your printer regularly) to print normally. Unfortunately, I’ve never paid attention to how long it has been before each printing. Nevertheless, this is not a problem with official inks or even Costco refills! Rating this product - when it’s good, it’s good. But those moments when it fails, is horrible!",0,0
RGDMBGHQTBSXT,"My god this was such a horrible stapler.  I was in the market for a heavy duty stapler because the higher-ups at my job don't provide the best staplers for their employees and I decided to just get one myself.  The kind of job I have at work involves stapling papers all the time....I could use a stapler up to 60 times or more per day and that takes a toll on a regular office stapler.  Sometimes I would staple thick stacks but mostly thin stacks.  After two years at the place where I work, I've already broken two staplers and I knew it was only a matter of time before they made me buy my own stapler.  So I decided to do it right after I broke my second one.  While the reviews for this product were mostly positive with the exception of one other reviewer, unfortunately I have to side with that lone review that gave this product a one star rating.  It jammed almost every time I tried to use it.  Then after I got it to work, it refused to push the next staple forward.  Then I took out the 1/4"" inch staples and put in a 3/8"" inch and I still got the same problems.  The stapler did work with 15/16"" staples without jams but then the staples would protrude back up..which means you could accidentally stab yourself!  Plus I didn't have anything thick enough that would require a 15/16"" staple.  This stapler was marketed being able to staple anything from 2-220 sheets but I can tell you right off the bat that's not true.  It's possible that this stapler requires special staples like the Stanley Bostitch EZ Squeeze 130 (Which I wound up replacing this garbage with) but it never specified that it did unlike the Bostitch 130.  For the record I did find Rapid Staples but at that point I was so disgusted with this stapler I just chucked it instead of returning it.  If you are looking for an all purpose stapler that can handle small and thick stacks of paper, go with the Bostitch 130, not this.",0,0

R3PRP6ZN94DAAI,"Carefully consider the other reviews.  There is a serious critical flaw that renders this item near useless.  First, look at the positive reviews and see how long the reviewers have had the item - not very long.  I've only had it for several months, and just did a ""check"" tonight to make sure I could access the case rapidly.  It didn't work.  Why?  Were the batteries dead?  No.  The plastic battery compartment that holds the batteries is shockingly flimsy.  The lag of rigidity means the batteries cannot make contact, and therefore you cannot open the safe.  Unable to open the safe I had to hunt for the manual keys (defeating the purpose of having electronic access) and open it up only to find that the stunningly cheaply made flimsy battery holder was warped (despite being kept in a climate controlled environment and have had it only for a few months) preventing the batteries from maintaining contact, which prevented me from opening the case with the electronic code. I push the batteries into place, they pop right back out.  If you are OK with only being able to access the case with a manual key, maybe this will work for you, though there are cheaper options for that kind of manual access.  If you want an electronic key-code access, you simply cannot trust or depend on this case.",0,0

R3O00XTQVN3W2U,"This is my third Palm.  I started out with the orginial one; then a Palm Vx.I am not too computer savvy.  I have to have my son help me with hardware/software.  I bought this in Dec. 05.  Several times at the most inconvenient times, it doesn't turn on even without a soft reset.  But it will turn on when I plug it into the USB port on my computer...except that I am usually not anywhere near my computer when this happens. I travel a lot and when it refuses to turn on even when my battery is almost fully charged, it is very frustrating.The customer support is awful...can't get them on the phone and the website addresses the problem with a soft reset which doesn't solve my problem.  But I would like this fixed!I recently had a problem with my HP laptop and the HP support was awesome.  Palm customer support has a lot to learn and certainly won't win any JD Powers awards.

R1CJX276J0E2PP,"I bought this chair and I'm a little pessimistic about it. I've owned other big & tall chairs as well as regular chairs. I can tell you that in a regular chair, the first thing to go are almost always the casters. The second to go is almost always the height and recline angle bar, internal to the adjustment mechanism. I have owned other big & tall chairs that have enforced, heavy-duty casters, thicker bars and a thicker, stronger ""elevation mechanism"" - not exactly sure what its called. I don't really see any of that on this chair and I'm pessimistic that this chair will work out for the long term. Also, as another reviewer mentioned, the seat itself isn't very wide. Every big & tall chair I've owned also has a wider seat, this one does not. So all of those items make me believe that this isn't a REAL big & tall chair. I feel like TUL has just added some more padding and called it big & tall but I don't see any of the construction that indicates to it lasting me a long time. I'm disappointed in this purchase.",0,0

R30ASIEC8R2VHS,"I don't usually write reviews, but this company really pissed me off.The stamp is fine, that isn't my issue.My issue is that there's no way to get small text. I read some other customer reviews and people recommended filling all 5 lines in order to get small text. So I did this, but I didn't want 5 lines of stuff, I just wanted small text. So I put it in this format:..(Text)(Text)(Text)Basically I added periods in the top 2 lines as placeholders so they would scale down the size of the text. They did not do this, so I asked for a refund. After receiving a refund, the company wrote an email and asked me how to fix the issue, which I detailed pretty clearly. Jump ahead a few days and it's Deja vu. They've sent me another stamp IDENTICAL to the first one they sent, neither of which being what I ordered or wanted.So I said forget it, took my free stamp, and ordered from Vista print.

R1DBWZXXBAX55K,"This is a great chair with a very strong hydraulic and pretty great lumbar support. Aesthetically, its quite pleasant and attractive.

All-in-all, a great purchase worth the money.Just remember one thing: leather does not breathe as easily as mesh. After the first 4 hours or so, you're going to need to stand to let it cool for a while.UPDATE 10/16:Sadly I have to revise my original rating down as I'm having a rather serious issue with my chair.

R1J64U6MSDLWO6,"I hate reviews that rate the manufacturer or the delivery rather than the product. But in this case, I believe the rating of the manufacturer is appropriate. The chair came unassembled with a flimsy Allen wrench. The assembly took approximately 45-60 minutes. The very last assembly was the arm to the back. This is where I found out that the part did not fit and the arm could not be attached to the chair making it a ""one arm"" desk chair.Now comes the good part. I contacted the manufacturer as per the instructions. I faxed a copy of the parts request form and Amazon receipt and waited for a response. After 3 calls to inquire when the new arm would be shipped, I was finally told that it would be shipped the next day and would have it by Christmas (the chair was supposed to be a Christmas present. Today I get a response to another (my 3rd) e-mail inquiry that the part is back ordered and hopefully I will receive it in 10-12 weeks.This is a company the knowingly sells defective products and does not provide for replacement for 3-4 months.

R3K9NHU3VL1VAZ,"I purchased this printer in July of 2010, which means I have owned it for over two years now, and in those two years I have gone through 5 print heads.  Each time the print head failed the ink cartridges were between half to full.  I called Lexmark tech support five times and they verified what I had already knew, the print head failed.  Lexmark Tech support was very kind and helpful, and every time I called with a problem they sent a new print head and new print cartridges, but it always seems that the print head failed when I required the printer the most.  As of the writing of this product review another print head failed, so I am looking for another printer.  The said fact is that I worked at Lexmark and I know they can make a better product than this over sized ""plastic paper weight.""So, to sum this review up, I give the printer one star and Lexmark tech support 5 stars, but I am not going to reflect the tech support rating in the overall rating of this product because the review is on the printer.My advice to all of you out there, avoid this printer, it is a waste of money.  Unfortunately, after reading many of the customer reviews on the various printers (from the most notable printer manufacturers) there isn't too much out there to choose from in the reliable low cost printers arena.  It seems the manufacturers of these printers are more concerned about the bottom line than producing good printer.

R3SB3KNJ7QITNK,"I was very impressed with this printer for the first 6 months, however, a multitude of problems have since rendered this thing nearly useless.  What a waste. As many other reviewers have complained, the printhead developed problems and had to be replaced early on, the WiFi constantly lost connection with the computer, requiring frequent printer reboots (my other WiFi devices have no such problem), the software freezes, particularly when printing from Windows Explorer (even with the Lexmark Toolbar), and the cartridges simply stop printing evenly, even after multiple cleanings. There are other problems as well, but I will spare you.  All drivers/firmware etc. have been updated.  I eventually pulled the plug on the WiFi and use ethernet.

R1RL6B574Q2EXR,"This product does work, but don't buy it planning to easily adjust the height.  Each individual joint has a knob that you press in to adjust the level of that segment.  Thankfully, the button/knob does have degrees on it because you'll have to make sure the other side is exactly the same or the table will not work.  It took a lot of finagling to get it to a usable height where it was balanced and would not fall and I found it no use for bed (was hoping to use after back surgery while laying) but I did end up using this on my desk to raise my laptop so I can use it while standing.  But once you get it in the right position you are not going to easily raise or lower it because if you adjust one segment you have to adjust the other segments or else the balance is off.  The pros are that it is lightweight.  There were no instructions for attaching the mouse pad to the table and I wish there had been recommended settings (degrees on the knob/buttons) to make it easier to put it in the position you're looking for without so much trial and error.  My 17 inch laptop does fit on it and overhangs the back slightly - about 1-2 inches - not enough to cause any balance issues.  It is a nice idea for a concept but it doesn't really work in practice and I definitely wouldn't buy again or recommend to anyone else unless you plan on putting it in one position and leaving it there indefinitely/permanently (and not needing to fold up for storage).  This product was just under thirty dollars when I purchased it.  For ten to fifteen dollars I would probably rate it a star higher b/c it'd be a decent value, but it wasn't worth what I paid.",0,0

R1J9JN83JVHZ1S,"First things first:  This unit is more like a thermal wax transfer printer (for those of you old enough to remember those) than a laser. I didn't know this until after I bought it and read that it puts down a thin layer of wax to create colors. When crinkled, you can see the wax ""crack"" or wear down. True laser printers don't use wax. Okay, not that huge of a deal breaker because of the low price.But then there's the question of how economical it is to keep.  The replacement toner cartridges cost more than the unit itself. Other reviews talked about how it drains power out of the sockets - it's totally true! Our computer room has 4 breakers, with the overhead fan/light & desk lamps on the lowest powered one (the original - we added the rest). The first time I turned it on, ALL of the lights flickered for more than a few seconds. When you power it up or print to it, it sucks the electricity right out of the wall! That can't be good news for when our electric bill comes.It is very slow to print, which is acceptable considering the price.  The wireless networking feature doesn't work like it's supposed to, and we tried every which way to set it up.One major annoyance is that I lose the device status/connectivity every time I shut down or reboot my pc.  We've got it hardwired to the network, and everything's perfectly fine until I have to reboot/power down my computer. When I power back up, the device shows as being ""Offline"", even though the printer is on. The printer is still listed under ""Devices & Printers"", but until I reinstall it, it will continue to show it as offline.But, if you don't mind the power drain, wax transfer, high replacement toner cost, and using the printer directly connected to your pc via usb, it's definitely the printer to buy.

I was overlooking that, assuming it was simply an issue with the design. (It would appear that if you put pressure at the top of the clip it pushes the bottom of the clip away from the pen to make it easier to slip in a shirt pocket.) But, the final straw was that the pen had difficulty engaging the ink cartridge.  It would take multiple attempts to engage at times, and sometimes the cartridge would retract when you tried to write with it. I changed the cartridge and still had the same issue.  I am a fan of LAMY, and do like the design, but I was not going to spend this much on a ballpoint that was not reliable.  Maybe I received a return that had problems.

R1A8B5HALR35XJ,"Update to my previous 5 star review.  When I ordered the HP 92/93 cartridges I ordered two sets.  The first set worked fine and lasted a long time.  The second set which I just put in worked fine at first and then ink faded out after only about 10 pages of printing.  I put my printer thru the cartridge cleaning cycle and the amount of ink got even worse.  Useless cartridges.  Sadly it is obviously hit or miss with these and I will never be buying again.______________________________________________________________________________________________________________Previous review  - Both HP 92 and 93 cartridges work greatIt's been over 10 years since I have given remanufactured ink cartridges a shot.  They were always leaking and worked streaky at best.  So I've been buying the HP 92 and 93 dual pack to be sure they would work.  But the cartridges are very pricey and when I saw the price and reviews of the Valuetoner cartridges I decided to give them a shot.  If they didn't work out - nothing really lost due to the price.  I was totally impressed with the purchase right upon receiving them.  The cartridges are packaged individually and with great care.  They also come with detailed and clear details on the cartridges themselves, how they work and how to troubleshoot if your printer won't see them as valid cartridges.  It all went very simply for me.  My printer noted that they weren't authentic HP cartridges but accepted them right away and printed the test page the same as after every cartridge installation.  These cartridges did not leak at all upon opening and printed flawlessly upon installation.  The test page was perfect and after about 100 pages both cartridges have not streaked or faltered in quality at all.  I see some people feel some cartridges are not performing as they wish.  Honestly that has happened with authentic HP cartridges to me many times as well.  I print many photos and often with the HP cartridges they would start fading or streaking after only 10 prints and I would have to put my printer through the clean cartridges mode.  With these Valuetoner cartridges that has yet to happen.  I am more than thrilled and impressed with their quality and the professional packaging of the company.  I highly recommend giving this company and these cartridges a shot.  If my cartridges do indeed start to falter I will adjust this review accordingly to be as accurate and helpful as possible.",0,0

RGTELAL2HB7PU,"This calendar has many reviews from people saying they received damaged or incomplete sets of cards. I decided to take a chance on it anyway, figuring that maybe people who had this experience would be more likely to write a review, and that it probably doesn't happen very often. Unfortunately, I now think this is the norm for this product and not the exception. The cards I received were coated in some sort of white powder that I just spent 20 minutes trying to wipe away (not a great experience as my guess is that it's some sort of chemical), and even after the cleaning process many of the cards are still unusable. I really like the concept of this calendar with it's storage pockets, two-sided number cards in yellow and red, and both English and Spanish words. However this really isn't an acceptable way to offer a product.

RLNXDTDKA0GS4,I bought three tagging guns. Two were Yazy Craft guns because they were cheaper. I paid extra for this Amram gun because I saw good reviews and I thought it might be my favorite of the three. After tagging 1500 products with my employees I can definitely say the Amram gun is worthless. It was worthless after tagging 10 products.

R3IMFUC861DBPZ,"I purchased the notebook from the Basics website. The concept and the structure of the notebook are great. However, the execution of the notebook is less than excellent. While I don't intend to make a return, as I ordered internationally and the functionality of the product is somehow fine (also, I love the colour of the cover- girls will be girls!), I was hoping for a much better aesthetic experience.Let me give you a little insight into my notebooks obsession, before I jump to the feedback. As the daughter of a librarian who later got to own a school supplies store, I grew up around paper, blank and typed. I have developed a ""taste"" for paper. And granted, I have no expertise in the production and design of paper, blank or typed, I have great expertise as a consumer of notebooks. My ""must"" souvenir from whatever country I visit is the ""best notebook I can possibly find"" walking through the old neighbourhoods of Barcelona, along the charming streets of Zielona Gora, or anywhere else, really. I carry on me at all times 2-3 notebooks: one for my inner truths, one for planning my days, and a Bamboo Spark for mixing paper and digital when working. I could go on and on, but I will stop now. I was hoping this notebook would be some sort of 2 in 1 and reduce my paper load. It didn't. Bottom line, I am a notebook freak. That's where this feedback is coming from:- the sideview of the notebook looks somehow messy, not at all like a high-end notebook/planner. This is exactly how it looks out of the box, I did not put anything inside it.- the cover has small colour defects, caused by the elastic bands- the inside of the cover looks poorly glued. So much so, that just 3 days into using it, the cover is starting to fall apart.- also, the way the elastic band is glued on the inside of the cover does not look entirely professional, and because of the thin paper (to which I will get back later), it may cause ""bumpy"" handwriting on the following pages- when opening the notebook, the first page was glued to the cover in the corner, which caused an ugly breakup seconds later- the ink used for the text is not always equally distributed, the aspect is messy- the pages are rather thin, as the very thin fine-liner managed to almost imprint the other side of the page:- the back pocket came with a corner and a non-flat aspect- and last, but not least, one of the selling points is (potentially) misleading, or at least inconsistent: the description reads lined but the pictogram on the back of the box shows dotted pages. Now, dotted notebooks are my absolute favourites in the world. I was actually a bit disappointed when I didn't locate any dotted page in the notebook.Any single one of these ""faults"" would be easy to overlook, even by a notebook geek like myself, but all of them together kind of ruin the ""premium experience"". Totally not worth the 30 bucks + international shipping. Had I read the reviews before purchasing, I would have spent my money on a real notebook (yeah, it's more of a planner than a notebook).",1,1

R1243G2T5IKA85,"As the saying goes, you get what you pay for. I ordered two sets and sorry I even ordered one.There are more negatives with these pens, than positives. The pastels (WaterChalk) are completely useless. Although there appears to be ink, in the barrel, little comes out and when it does, it's very scratchy. The same holds true for the neons.The metallics and glitters flow OK, but you have to shake the ink down, to get the ink flowing and continue to shake, during use. However, don't shake too hard, since the barrel may fly out of the casing. Took me a few minutes to find the barrel on the other side of the room, the first time I used the pens.The ink also takes some time to dry, so be careful not to accidentally smear an area, you just finished working on.Another pen, the nib literally, fell out of the pen completely. No pressure, just went to use the pen and the nib, fell out. I expect, with more use, other nibs will soon follow suit. See image.I didn't expect a great pen, for the cost, but I did expect all pens to at least work. They are very poorly made, so don't expect much.I sincerely believe, those who left positive reviews (minus the 50 unverified reviews), were pressured by the seller to leave a review and left reviews, prior to using the pens, based on the case the pens are packaged in, which is the best part of the entire item.

R263OUDU7RLFUC,"Garbage pens - there is more moisture in the Gobi desert than the ink of these pens.  A further insult is that I only received 8 out of 12 pens.  Oh yes, they arrived loose, unhermitically sealed in a plastic bag within a plastic bag, and not the box illustrated above.  I had initiated a return to Amazon but resigned myself to eating this loss, rather than staining my reputation with Amazon: I don't think they would believe that I had received a plastic bag of 8 pens instead of the 12 I had paid for.  Even that wouldn't be so bad if even a handful of these accursed pens actually ejected the consistent iota of ink necessary for a ballpoint pen to function/have a purpose for existence.As it is, after shaking vigorously for 20 seconds, about an inch of ink will come out before it goes dry.  These ""RT BLX"" pens were highly rated on WireCutter etc, but my personal experience has embittered me towards this entire brand, for the next 7 lifetimes.  These pens, if I haven't been sufficiently clear, are not just entirely useless, their very presence soils the sight and spoils the mood.In summary, I wish to inform the good folks at Amazon to know that they are stocking literal junk in the form of these pens.  I obviously don't recommend them, and I lost good money buying them. And if you are compelled to buy them, I strongly recommend counting the pens, and trying each one immediately after receipt, and sending them back in a timely fashion if they don't work.Thank you for your time, and I bid you a fond adieu.",0,0

RJ4U12LSC3CEY,"This review is about my experience and not a review of the planner itself as I have not been able to use it yet. I ordered direct from their website.I ordered the A5 size planner because I like to carry it with me, like a journal, pretty much how it is intended, I don't like the bulky B5's and haven't used one for that reason, which is why I was actually a PassionPlanner user for many years. So I was excited about the A5 in freedom mastery, I've been watching their company grow for years, and just waiting for the smaller planner size. What I didn't know when I purchased the A5 was that the layout was completely different than the B5. It is not very obvious in the details nor in the ""description"" which is a generic video that reviews the B5 size. So I ordered the A5 size assuming it was the same layout. NOPE, 1. all the months are in the front part of the planner, and 2. the weeks are not ""5a-10:30pm"" time slots, they are just blocks of days that are stacked, e.g. block for monday, tuesday and weds on the left page, then on the right page thurs, fri, sat, sun. there are little checkboxes on the left edge with a "" : "", I presume for entering your own time.So, I requested a return given it was unclear that the layouts weren't the same. Well I ordered the planner on 10/3/20, received it on 10/8/2020, and on 10/9/2020 I requested a return. I got an email saying they'll get back to me soon and gave a ticket for tracking progress. I kept checking the ticket and it said status: ""awaiting your reply"". So I figured they were super busy, but literally 2 weeks in I was getting impatient. So on the ticket I indicated I was still waiting to get a response. The next day, still no response, so then I thought ""awaiting your reply"", was there something I missed? Was there something I was supposed to reply to? So I wrote again, saying just that. Then I get this email, generic type ""we see you've gotten the planner, tell us how it is"" type thing, so I responded ""still waiting on a response from my first question. This is 10/23/20 by the way, they finally respond and apologize profusely, asking if I want a return they'd refund, but I'd have to pay for shipping, but if I wanted an exchange they would wave the shipping for the new item. I thought that was reasonable. So I responded around 10/26 that I was willing to try the B5 since I was still interested in the planners process. They responded that I would get a separate email with an RMA#. But there was no comment on the planner I was wanting in exchange...now 10/29, still no email with RMA#, so I wrote back again, they said I should have gotten an email from UPS, but nope, checked spam, trash, inbox, with every variation of searches for ""UPS"" ""RMA"" and the number they gave me...nothing.

R24HKSEN9SWF1L,"Booo.  I was so disappointed that this cart was such a bust.  I live in a historic neighborhood, one that comes with mature tree roots wreaking havoc on the streets and sidewalks.  I made it the 1/2 mile to the grocery without issue.  I was pretty annoyed that the back wheels don't swivel, making it impossible to turn the cart when pushing it through the grocery store like a traditional shopping cart.  Because of the bad reviews I read about weight and making sure the bottom doesn't bow, I was minding my list of veggies, a few dry goods and 1 gallon of drinking water.  All was well and I headed out of the store.  No bowing, no squeaks.  Nothing to show any signs of stress.  I walked on the street for part of the way as the sidewalk is pretty non-existent because of the tree roots with makeshift ""bridges"" and I wasn't going to test it.  Once I got to a place that I could move safely onto the sidewalk I hit a small pothole and SNAP.  The entire middle plastic part of the wheel snapped right off.  There I was, standing there with my sad, broken-down old lady cart.  i had to call my husband to have him come pick me and our groceries up - which he was none to pleased with since it was football Sunday and he had regaled himself to the man-cave and determined to not wear pants for the entire day.

""...Correction Tape Assorted Colors"" sure makes it sound like it is different colors.  This product isn't the only one labeled this way.  The whole correction tape category is filled with specific colors in the description.  After paying for this one and receiving it I realize that not only is this one white, so are all the others.  I couldn't find any correction tape that was not white.  White out is available in different colors for colored paper, so I assumed when they said colors, they meant colors, not just the color of the plastic it comes in.  I have now read the reviews on some of the other ""color"" correction tape in this category and others were fooled as well.  As they said, ""Why would I care what color plastic it comes in?""  I couldn't agree more.  If they just said, ""White correction tape"" in the product line that would make more sense.",0,0

R2KDM1WLN5RKF3,"This Book and Copy Holder suffers from poorly thought-out design.  The cross-piece support in the back can be set to various heights, acheiving a different angle for your paper, but there is no locking or snapping into place.  Every time you lift, move or bump the holder, the support comes out and it falls down backwards.I have used strong tape to hold it in position so it will stay in place.  But in the lowest position it does not come close to the 87 degrees I'd prefer.  It's closer to 75 degrees.  Not a deal-breaker, ladies, but not my preference.And as others point out, not a book holder.  It's not wide enough, it's to lightweight and the design is just not right for that purpose.I'd give it three stars, but not for the $8 they charged me.  I'd say it's worth five.",0,0
R3F6871RFB8SMV,"I bought this laptop stand to help me teach while being quarantined. I liked the flexibility of making the table sit in a myriad of different arrangements, as I tried to figure out the best way to arrange my setup (I used a Chromebook on this table and an iPad next to it). I didn't use it in the summer as we were on vacation, and brought it out again this August to get it ready for school again. I used it for September and then just over halfway through October I was putting my Chromebook on it for a lesson and one of the legs snapped!! The Chromebook is NOT a heavy machine... I was quite perturbed. This was not that cheap, and for it to break after being in use for not even five full months is ridiculous. I am going to try to contact the company for a replacement (though it now says it is out-of-stock) and will update this review once I do, but in the interim...

What I found with this sharpener is the tips of the pastel pencils break easily (as in most sharpeners) and I have to take the case off to dislodge the point in the mechanism. What I found with this model is it's difficult to put the case back on once removed. I tried many angles and rotations to get it to snap back in.

R1D9WST6Z2PR7M,"I have bought and used two of these in a row for our small office. I love the features and see it as a GREAT unit with one crippling flaw. The printheads always end up clogging and producing unusable results from that time forward. I have never put anything but Epson ink in both units. Also, it gets used every day, seven days a week so it never sits for long periods of time without printing. Once the heads clog, running the cleaning cycle over and over does nothing, aligning the heads does nothing, replacing the ink cartridges does nothing. I now have regularly-spaced horizontal banding and smears on the text. The first printer went 1 1/2 years before the printhead clogged. The latest one went only 3 months. I didn't write a negative review on the first one but, when it repeated, felt others should know. Sad...because the features, speed, and ink economy are very good.",0,0

R3COZKXN6A445N,"I have never written a product review before and I've purchased a lot of products.  I ordered the Epson 725 primarily to print on DVD's.  I heard Epson had come a long way since they started printing on dvd's.  I did my research, and chose the Artisan 725.  Setting up the printer was easy enough.  Printing on DVD/CD's has indeed improved and the quality is nice.  However, I also print DVD covers on premium glossy paper.  Here is where there are problems.  The paper feeder is incredibly flimsy.  You can not print continuously with glossy paper unless you don't mind a constant paper jam or the paper going in crooked.  When the feeder jams it rips the edge of the sheet rendering it impossible to try to get through again. Out of 100 sheets of glossy paper I've wasted 22.  This is very frustrating.  I can not recommend this product unless you want to print on regular paper or on dvd's.  Don't purchase this if you work with photographs.",0,0

R6M6RQI092TP2,"I play CS:GO, just under 6000 hours in and still going strong. I have used many mousepads over the years. The list includes:Logitech G440Razer Goliathus Speed LargeRazer Goliathus Speed ExtendedHyperX Fury S ProHyperX GTF-XCorsair MM300 ExtendedCorsair MM600Steelseries Qck+Steelseries Qck+ LimitedFnatic Boost ControlFnatic Boost SpeedA Used Cutting Board (literally)As well as many not special or famous brand mousepadsI do not consider this a fast mouse pad. I have played with hard pads, soft pads, and hybrids. It has the worst aspects of both kinds of mousepads. The Static Friction is very high as a result of the mousepad's surface. Static Friction is the force keeping an object at rest, as in not moving. Some people prefer high friction mousepads so they can ""stop on a dime"", right when they wish the mouse to stop moving, they just stop applying force. This is not a typical high friction mousepad.The problem is that this mousepad has an odd ratio of the Static Friction to the Kinetic Friction.Kinetic Friction is the force stopping or slowing a moving object.Its difficult for me to explain precisely how one of the problems feel;When the mouse is moving in one direction, in order to then move in a different direction while moving you have to overcome the friction of the mousepad again at that angle. I assume it is because of the way the stitching is done.I haven't had this issue with other higher friction mousepads.It makes it difficult for me in games that requires non straight line movements.I switch between mousepads sometimes based on situation, or how my mouse feet are behaving. Currently my pair is the HyperX GTF-X, and the Razer Goliathus Speed Large. With the GTF-X the static friction is low, so small movements in any direction can be done with very little effort. The kinetic friction is very close to the static friction, so I can consistently make wide turns with small adjustment after. With the Goliathus Speed, the static friction is slightly higher, but the kinetic friction is lower it requires less force than the initial force to keep the mouse moving.I play a Support/2nd-3rd Entry role on my team; I recognize that entrying is easier with the Goliathus Speed, so I can do several 180° turns, and they don't have to be accurate on the small scale, since it is close range and teammates are engaging. Otherwise the GTF-X is comfortable for everything else.I cannot effortlessly use the QCK+ Limited because the static friction is higher than is comfortable, and the kinetic friction while moving is still rather high, but less sticky feeling than the static frictionThis mousepad fits neither of my roles and therefore I can not recomend it personally. Some of you may prefer the way it feels. If you play other games, the issues I stated above will likely not apply.P.S. My feeling of fast and slow may be radically different than others because I played on hard pads much of my career too. I would even mix lotion with water on a folded rag and coat the surface of the hard pad with the mixture, wiping it clean every few minutes. There was so little friction that If I put a folded peice of paper under one side, the mouse would slide off the table. I had to apply force to stop the mouse when it was moving. If I lightly tapped it on with a finger, it would slide accross until its feet dropped off the surface of the hardpad.Please consider my perspective in your evaluation of my review, and your decisions because of it.",0,0
R2XUTVLE0PGW34,"Ditto to the negative reviews.  My last 3 Ampads have been (a) 2 of 3 not printed (or not cut) straight so lines not parallel/perpendicular to edges of paper, (b) 1 of 3 roughly cut so saw marks clearly visible on pad end, (c) 1 of 3 holes not punched to fit 3-ring binder nicely, (d) 3 of 3 right margin too small for page numbers, (e) paper progressively became thinner over my last 3 pads so that my current pad pages are thinner than printer paper, (f) pages don't tear off nicely (must cut down glue on top, after using about 3 or 4-mm of paper, I used to be able to just rip the glue off the top, but try that now and the entire glue band will separate), (g) glue as just described and doesn't keep cardboard back on very well.

Thankfully it didn't immediately pop or damage the projector as others have reported. However the color is very muted and has very low brightness. To make things worse after about 10 minutes the color will mess up causing sections to go black and white and become distorted.The seller that fulfilled my order for the bulb by BenQ (which wasn't actually by BenQ) was P-Lamps.

I tried to take it back, but after 3 months, I have to deal with the manufacturer directly.I run my own business, so I'm pretty savvy with computers and printers. I know more than the basics. Yet I am constantly on the phone with Kodak Tech Support, trying to figure out why the printer stopped working--yet again.  At best, I get a few weeks of printing without a problem. Then, once again, I'll get an error message.  Usually, uninstalling, then re-installing the software does the trick.  And their tech support is good.  But who has the time to keep calling them, and spending 30-60 minutes on the phone, while we go through their scripted problems.  WHAT A PAIN.  After it happened again today, I decided to write this review.If I could get my money back, I would.  I will NEVER buy another Kodak printer as long as I live.UPDATE 8/05/13I had customer service set me up--yet again. Told them the problem. They assured me it wouldn't happen again.I used the wireless version for several weeks, printing without a problem. Then I needed to do a scan.

R2PFXGC9ZU5CLN,"I am very disappointed in this company because for one, it took so long to get here. Then when it did the embosser groves were faint, when I pressed down on the paper you could barely see that it was an embosser. When I got ready to send it back I had to pay for shipping out of my pocket, let alone I already spend about $40 just to buy the embosser. So I won't be returning back to this company at all. If I didn't have to pay for the shipping I MIGHT have given them 3 stars. Even though it took so long to get here, but me having to pay for shipping out of my pocket and then having to wait on them AGAIN to get it and God only knows how long that is going to take.

R1K8PBPWJOX8OD,"The concept is great but as a student I honestly feel that the price point is simply to high.  For the money this item should be flawless in it's production, and while it seems mostly sturdy and well made I have serious doubts about it standing up over the long haul or still being functional after being dropped or knocked off a counter a few times.  I also had concerns about the decals  placed on the outside, I could see them becoming unreadable in short order and there were numerous air bubbles under both on the unit I received.  This definitely isn't the worst idea ever but my pocket space is premium real estate and for half the cost I can carry the Oakes book and a Mead 5 star pocket notebook.",0,0
R1OWFHMO1QCYZ1,"I'm assuming that my bad review among mostly good reviews is reflective of what it was used for. However, even though most others mentioned they used it to wrap dishes and I needed it to wrap a greater variety of items including furniture, I still found the quality of the foam to be lacking. First, I did expect a larger box, the same size as the box of bubble wrap I got from sam's club, but it was quite a bit smaller. When it came time to use it, I first noticed how thin and cheap it looked. Then quickly found out how thin and cheap it really was-- even though it is perforated, it tends to rip and shred in any spot when you pull it out if the box. Plus it's not going to do much for protecting any of our possessions because it is so fragile. I would have returned it, however we needed it right then since we are moving. We will probably end up making a last minute run to the hardware store tomorrow to find some better quality foam to reinforce. Basically, buying this product was a huge waste of money and a waste of time since we have to rewrap everything again.",0,0
R2E5LT1YDM6RUL,"The images showing this in use as a laptop table with the tilt function raised are absolutely fraudulent. There is simply no way this tray is sturdy enough to support even a small 15"" laptop with the tilt raised. Placing the laptop on the tray causes it to bend, tilting it down on one side. Trying to place your hands on it to type will tip the laptop right off the tray. Avoid this at all costs. I read the reviews and thought I could make it work for the simple application I needed if for. Wrong. It is useless unless you plan on leaving it on a flat surface with the tilt bar down and never touch the laptop once its on the tray. In other words, you would be better off putting a stack of books under your laptop. I think amazon still sells those, too.",0,0

R2NHI8C4NR8C1W,"Why oh why does this cart have so many positive reviews? This thing is grade A crap.Assembly was straightforward until I reached the casters, which should have been easy as well. Not a single one of them correctly popped into place, they’re not the exact right size for the metal legs of the cart, not to mention that one of the cart legs is slightly oval shaped instead of circular. Even with padding, I bruised my hand and got a blood blister trying to force the things in. I knew then that I should give up, disassemble, and return the product. Did I? No.Have I mentioned that thing thing is cheap? It’s VERY wibbly-wobbly with my Cricut Maker on it and I don’t expect it to last long. I’m convinced that if my cat jumps on it, the whole thing will come crashing down. I can’t store anything else even remotely weighty which essentially defeats the purpose of the shelves/drawers. It shakes a fair amount when my Cricut is in use, to the point where I worry that my design will be flawed. The casters are incredibly cheap and very small, not large enough to roll over.. well anything really: certainly not a throw rug, the tracks for my sliding closet door, or the line where my carpet changes to linoleum. I have to lift each side of the cart to move it past those areas, which makes it cumbersome and a hassle to move around. The shelves themselves are thin and “pop” like the lid of a pickle jar that’s been opened. The whole thing feels flimsy and after a few weeks of use I’m ready to replace it.",0,0

Instead, it immediately put a nasty gouge right into the new wood molding I had just installed around the door.  At first, I thought I must have installed it incorrectly.  But no, that's how this thing is supposed to work, by pressing the metal edges of the stop on the door and molding to keep the door from opening too far.  Wood molding can't stand up to that metal edge so you immediately get a major ding in the molding.  Crazy!

R2F2FGPXICNPC5,"You can purchase more ink to fill the stamp but just be warned you will need to have that on hand if you intend to use the stamp regularly.The design worked out only took a couple of proofs.  Included pictures.I'm on the fence about recommending.. 50 stamps seems pretty suspiciously low for a vendor that also sells the ink to resupply.  However, I'm no expert so maybe 50 stamps is about the max this stamp can handle.  That will take a long time to verify.I gave roughly 3½ stars due to:1.  The 2 week time-lapse between buying / receiving coupled with the low first supply of ink.2.  Low amount of starter Ink3.  Physically the unit itself seems to be able to lock down inside the included lid to prevent ink drying but I cannot get it to lock & each time I try it wastes ink by pressing the stamp against the inside of the plastic lid.4.  Physically the top label was off center so I had to put a sticker on to show where the true front was located.5.  Wasted a lot of ink (still counted in my total) just testing it on a piece of paper until it started to actually be acceptably clear.Nothing is deal breaking on its own but it all adds up to a lower rating over other outlets.EDIT:  Refilled but doesn't work anymore.

R2FWJZXREIIXDM,"I used these with an Epson WF-7620 printer.Thus far, I am very happy with these ink cartridges. They are certainly not as rich as the Epson cartridges, and I would not use them for work where print quality is of great importance, but I am happy with them to use for general printing and scratch-work. The cost saving is tremendous. The only issue I had stemmed from attempting to use a ""fine"" quality ink setting when printing. This resulted in my printer nozzles becoming clogged. Since the printer can clean the nozzles, it merely resulted in wasted ink, but be warned.Update: I have gone through 2 of these cartridges now and my opinion still stands. These are great for scratch-work, but I have noticed they do not handle very fine lines very well. No number of print-head alignments fixes this, so I can come out with some hazy images (in my case, music staff lines). This isn't a big deal for what I do with them, but it's good to know. I have also noticed that my printer gives me false low-ink readings, however. Keep that in mind if you purchase them.Update 2: The 2nd time purchased a set of 2 of these cartridges, I was sent cartridges of a different brand, E-Z Ink. I'm not sure who owns that brand, but a customer representative told me that, when they do not have the LD branded ones in stock, they will send out others. They did vouch for the quality of the cartridges and there is still a ""lifetime warranty,"" but this is unnerving because it was not wanted I ordered. I will have to see if the E-Z Ink carts work as well as the LD ones, but it renders reviews for this product somewhat useless if a customer cannot be assured to get what they have researched via reviews.

I'm going for the new Epson Expression EcoTank cuz these babies can be easily refilled with ink which is much more affordable than actually counting the amount of pages your cartridges will do before they run out.

First a little magenta toner was streaking one edge of the paper, then within a couple of weeks the cyan cartridge started doing it as well, a cleaning cycle stopped it for about a day and now spots of toner are going on every page I print and it's pretty much unusable. The price was great, but the quality just isn't there. I've ordered OEM cartridges, and I hope I didn't do actual damage to the laser. Lesson learned, I guess. I give two stars instead of one because they performed so well at first.EDIT: I will credit their customer service. Within a day they contacted me and shipped me a new set of toner cartridges overnight. I had already installed OEM carts in the printer by then, but I will try the new ones as soon as I use up the HP ones, and will update my review again at that point. Stay tuned.

R3861R0M1SDGZQ,"I'm an Architecture major who is constantly sketching on all kinds of surfaces. I needed a pen that would not dry out and would provide consistent thin lines. A friend recommended these to me.Now, maybe for a secretary, banker, or business man, only needing to write a name on paper or maybe a checklist, this pen would work Ok. But for my specific requirements the pen is obsolete. After a pretty extensive test (a lecture, and design review) This pen began to gel-up ink on the tip and daub the paper with huge blobs. The ink is painfully slow to dry, does a poor job writing in any position but 90 degrees from the writing surface, and overall is horrible for any artistic application.

R2FY1A6T4TZATJ,"We are not impressed at all with the poor performance of this machine or the support from Samsung regarding the issues we are experiencing.  The main ones are as follows,1) Wastes a lot of paper printing error pages that cannot be turned off when a page fails to print correctly.  The print driver is supposed to support all the way back to OS X 10.6 and it does work, some of the time.  The same driver from OS X 10.9.5 works more often but still has issues printing random PDF files and many Pages files.  When it fails, it typically starts spitting out pages with a few odd characters printed and will not cancel.  The only way to stop it is to pull the drawer out so it stops pulling paper and wait for the last sheet pulled to cycle through then shut off the machine to clear the print job.  It does not clear from the panel button that is supposed to cancel jobs and does not and it can't be stopped from the print queue in OS X after the job has been sent to the printer.  Many of the files that won't print right from Lion print just fine from Mavericks.  All of the pages that don't print correctly print perfectly on a Xerox Phaser 6180DN.  Support's solution was to uninstall the printer and reinstall it with the same driver.  The solution sometimes works but mostly not, and one shouldn't have to keep uninstalling and reinstalling their printer just to print.2) The cartridge that comes with it should print 3000 pages at 5% coverage according to the specs for it (D203S).  We have had it use 83% of the toner with 1572 pages printed according to the web utility the machine comes with.  We are not printing graphics, just pages of text at 12 to 14 point and that would have been three reams of paper but we have barely gone through two so the counter isn't even accurate.  The specs for the toner capacity is simply not accurate for the D203S cartridge and the driver can't accurately count the number of pages it actually prints , including the error pages with a dozen odd characters on one line.3) Every time the printer comes on the lights dim.  This machine draws more power than the more than five year old four color Xerox Phaser 6180DN.  To get the power saving features it claims to have you have to sacrifice toner.  We are not using the power saving features because Samsung toner costs more than the wasted electricity.  It has not flipped a breaker yet but it is really annoying to have the lights dim all the time when using the printer.I selected this printer largely on reviews here on Amazon knowing that many people also had noticed its power hungry nature but I did not read issues with its unreliability in printing from older Apple OSes.  Personally I can't recommend this printer at all or the Samsung support solution. At least their support person spoke fluent English without a difficult to understand accent - too bad their support solution doesn't consistently work.",0,0

R3RMJU8FI30GIQ,"20120425 UPDATE ...-------------------I think that I should mention that the NeatReceipts uninstaller leaves a lot behind when finished.  Granted, it did say there were a few files it could not remove; however, 610 megabytes in 274 files in 53 folders is a bit much for me to have to remove manually.  If it were possible, I would now rate the developers and the writers of their software as ZERO Stars because they were extremely sloppy and totally non-professional by leaving a lot of ""rubbish"" on my computer.  They really need to be ""Neat"" and clean up their mess!Also, I did notice, reading the logs, after uninstall, that they do have TWAIN drivers though not seemingly accessible to other software.AND, the change the Neat software install performed that causes the System32 folder to be displayed at each reboot was not fixed during uninstall.  Sloppy, totally sloppy!20120423 Original ...---------------------I really had great plans for this NeatReceipts Mobile Scanner and Digital Filing System. There were many receipts from two and a half months of travel and QuickBooks was ready. There were plenty of business cards to glean contact information. My plans were dashed! I am not sure where to begin in describing what this device and its associated software did NOT do for me. It was supposed to collect information from receipts. It seldom if ever processed the receipt especially if it was long. In all but a very few instances, little or no information was extracted from the receipt - and, what was extracted was mostly incorrect or put into the wrong field.  I am certain this was because of the terrible job of scanning. I tried business cards. Not much luck with them either. The scanner did not do an adequate job of scanning to allow the software to make a reasonable attempt to collect the contact information from the business cards. Neither black-and-white nor color scans of documents faired any better. The results were the same even after the calibration process was done.Over all, the device was a disaster and proved to be an exercise in futility.I manually corrected the flawed scanned-receipts to determine if the interface to QuickBooks offered maybe a reason to retain the unit (QB has a horrid UI)and it is very expensive to put QB on additional computers.  Well, the Neat unit's software did transfer some, but not all, of the data that might be collected from a receipt.Something annoying was, after install, at boot, the system32 folder started being displayed.  At one point, it became necessary to delete the database.  I could find no information in Help or on their website.  The only solutions available was to uninstall or just delete the folder containing the DB. It sorta worked; however, there were some artifacts left behind that could not be eliminated (showed 19 receipts but there were none).If you track cookies, this unit communicates with cloud.neat.com (...) each time the software is launched (session and secure).  Their cookie ""must"" be allowed for the software to operate.  If you are into reading the license, the license seems to restrict use of the software to one and only one computer while someone at neat wrote a FAQ that says the software can, also, be put on a mobile device.I guess I would have thought that the scanner would have had a TWAIN driver but it did not and could only be used with their software (in Device Manager it appears as an imaging device).Other reviews indicate the unit worked.

R1V37KHCU8OF7Z,"I bought this back in November, when the ""Toner Low"" message first appeared on my HL2270-DW, so that I wouldn't have to buy toner within a moment's notice and have my grad school work put on hold for ""printer issues.""Today I go to install it, once the ""Replace Toner"" error message arrives, and the ""Replace Toner"" light now won't go off. I can't print. I'm in the middle of printing a paper, and now I have to go to the library to finish printing. I bought the aftermarket toner thinking I was doing the right thing, buying it advance to nip any problems in the bud, but now I can't return this toner cartridge (which is leaking in the box, FYI) since it is past the window, and Brother support can't help me a bit.Now I'm reading all the reviews about streaky pages and I have to say just this: I paid $15 to learn that Brother toner is just the way to go because it comes with an actual guarantee that it WILL work, unlike this cheap piece o' junk.",0,0

R1QP1WYMJZK93D,"As stated by another reviewer, the exterior latches seem a bit flimsy. My primary complaint is that, although the specifications indicate that the interior will accommodate standard 8-1/2 x 11 letter paper, the front-to-back interior dimension is actually a bit smaller than 8-1/2 inches. Papers curl at the edges unless folded.Update - I have taken this chest out of service. I recently needed to get out some important papers for business at a local military installation. When I opened the chest, all of the papers inside felt damp and had a bad smell. This is despite having a large pouch of desiccated silica gel inside to try to lower the humidity. I don't know if this is the result of moisture getting in from outside (the chest is kept in an air-conditioned closed in the master bedroom) or if it is chemical out gassing from the plastic lining or insulation. Couple this new issue with the small size that causes standard, letter-size paper to curl, I do not consider this product useable. I will be consulting a professional as I move forward to try to find a better solution.",0,0

R3K3DRZLYQ6XKF,"I am getting discouraged in finding a quality laptop tray. This will be the second one that I am sending back. I read the reviews, and they were so mixed that I decided to give it a chance. I don't like that I would need to add my own adjustments to make it more functional e.g. adding something to the little side drawer so that it will stay closed until I want it open. If you were to tip the tray sideways even just a little for any reason, it will slide right out. Also, the little laptop bar that keeps the laptop from sliding off of the tray, is detachable, and a very weak piece of wood, so if you remove it a couple of times, I don't think it will hold up very well. In my opinion, it should have been glued in and made to be stationary for stability, whereas it wiggles when something is not propped against it and could probably be popped out with handling/storing. The tray came with a ding and scratch or two in the paint, but I think they occurred during the painting/staining process. It looks nice enough if you don't look too closely at it, and the propping portion was great and very functional. Overall though, for the price, I was worried that with the lack of quality (strong wood material) that if one of my 3 children were to knock into it accidentally, or if it fell for some reason, it just wouldn't hold up. $30 isn't expensive, but it's not inexpensive either, and I really need something with durability, but that looks nice and works in a functional way. It wasn't for me, but if you don't have high expectations then this is for you.",0,0
RPPI7L7J73RU9,"We had high hopes for removing cat hair from clothing, furniture, etc., with this little device.  It does work - once.  Then you have to spend minutes cleaning it, letting it dry, and then use it again.  So, cleaning off, say a pair of slacks is a half-hour-long process.  In comparison, using strips of 2"" wide masking tape took about two minutes, including the time it took to tear off strips, use them, and discard them.  It may be more wasteful in terms of material, but it works a lot better and lot more quickly than the Sticky Buddy.  The only reason I don't give it only one star is that it works - once.",0,0

RO8YK2G1KSILI,"Prepare for one very honest review ... 3M should think twice about charging (what is tantamount to) a king's ransom for this potential doorstop.Pros:Honestly, none that I can find. (And, I usually can find SOMETHING positive to note about a product).Cons:Installation was a nightmare. I originally ordered this for the desk in my office. However, once I received the astonishingly weighty tray (over sixteen pounds), I realized that I would have to drill sizable holes in one fairly expensive desk. Rather than nervously bore holes through a valuable piece of cherry, I decided to first experiment with it on a less pricey piece. And, thank goodness for that! Not only was installation a struggle (I needed an extra person to help me), but the end results was far from ergonomic. At first, I just assumed that I would have to ""get used to"" it (maybe years of ingrained, bad habits would have to be broken). Turns out, this was just painful and bizarre. No matter how I altered the product, it was just awkward. And, ""awkward"" soon translated to aches. Perhaps 3M needs to reexamine their design ... perhaps it's just a problem with me.If you were considering this on a whim, I vote that you skip it. If you came here because you are dead-set on buying this, maybe you will have better luck. (And, with these new reviews posted here, you will have a clearer idea of the potential drawbacks).",0,0

The front had fine yellow/gold glitter on it in some places, and some came off on my hands.  The 2 stars I gave it were because of the feel of the leather on the back cover (so nice and soft), and the fancy leather edging (very well done).

RVKW1N71G2H0P,"As other reviewers have indicated, the wrist strap portion of the 7” lanyard is not large enough for a man to slip his hand through. The seller’s photo indicates the wrist strap portion of the 7” lanyard is 5” long, but the 10 that I received have varying lengths of 4 3/8” to 5”. Only one was 5”, most were 4 ½”. So, instead of having a circumference of 10” (2 X the 5” length), the circumference of most is approx. 9”.The quality of the 7” lanyards is questionable. On 3 of them, the plastic piece that covers the joint between the wrist strap and the 1 1/2” end piece easily slips off (not properly glued in place?). This plastic piece not only covers the joint, but helps prevent the joint from coming apart. Also, on one, the wrist strap material was frayed.Of the ten 17” lanyards I received, one of them is missing the detachable connector, making it useless.In this case, the overall quality probably reflects the price paid.I would not purchase again.",0,0

Sometimes the black cartridge is working fine and the color isn't, and sometimes it's the opposite. There seems to be no rhyme or reason, and I feel like I wasted my money on this pack.

R36IL56S5XIJHY,"I was so excited to get this desk and there's a lot to love about it!- It fits my oversized laptop very well.- The wrist rest is the perfect height and made of memory foam, so it conforms to your wrists.- The desk is curved, to allow for you to bring it closer to you.- The light is easy to tuck away and it doesn't create any strange bulges or uncomfortable points.- The ""wood"" looks real and is beautifully done.So, why did I only rate it two stars?- I added the batteries (it requires 4 AA). First, the battery case is very tight, making it difficult to place batteries in and nearly impossible to get them out again.- Once I put in (brand new) batteries, and plugged in the light, nothing happened! The light didn't turn on and that was a major selling point of this desk for me. I'm greatly disappointed.I'll update this review if anything changes, but as of now, I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who's choosing it based on there being a light.",0,0

R3TORHOIGZFZN5,"This is a ridiculous, stupid and DANGEROUS idea. People, you do NOT NEED your electronic devices or food in front of you when you are in your car in the DRIVER'S seat!!! If you must work on your device, do it at at HOME or at the OFFICE, and NOT in the car. I am POSITIVE people are thinking they can multitask and work on their device or eat while they are driving. This is what this stupid thing is promoting and I do NOT LIKE IT. If a person is THAT addicted to their device and needs it in their face while driving, that person needs serious, professional help. I do not give a flying rat's behind if a person is stopped at a light or whatever. STAY OFF THE DEVICE until you get home or to the office or to a place where one is NOT on the road. The same goes for eating while driving. This thing should be illegal, because someone is going to cause an accident while having a device or food in their face while driving.I sincerely HOPE all the people giving this screen addiction device 5 stars are NOT using it while on the road at ANY time.

Then it goes to August where it starts with one page of an August weekly spread but once again dates are missing. It has Aug. 1, 5,6,7,8. On the next page it goes back to July’s weekly spreads beginning with July 9. After the July weekly spreads it goes to August monthly spread. Then, to September weekly spread beginning with September 3 but numbers are once again duplicated on the next page. It has 2 pages of September’s weekly spread and then jumps back to August’s weekly spread.

R3JK89JAAQYMIO,"I bought this product because of the great reviews, first off it was broken when I got it.  I had to super glue the battery compartment back in place, second off within the first 20 minutes of playing with the light I broke one of the clips.  Third its not adjustable at all so even though it just barely fits underneath my legs in bed, it doesn't leave much for switching positions and you feel pretty much like its glued onto you and you can't move.  Fourth the laptop sits to the left which is really kind of annoying and makes it very uncomfortable for long durations of typing.  Fifth it is very poorly designed, no metal, just VERY cheap plastic, with sharp edges, etc.The mouse pad is the best feature of the entire thing, another reason I chose this over others, but if you are sitting in bed or on the couch you tend to sit at an angle and the mouse will slide right off the thing if you let go of it for say two handed typing.  So it just makes for an awkward experience overall.  It is functional I guess, I could have made the same thing with four legs and a plank of wood though...

RKL2XUQEH4TF4,"My rating was lowered from four stars to two stars after I had to add update number 2.  Definitely pass on this one.This is a large unit.  I use it in an elementary classroom.  The sharpener dials to fit six different pencil sizes which is very convenient for the classroom.  It has an adequate shaving recepticle and is easily emptied.  (I also use the  Stanley Bostitch QuietSharp Executive in the classroom. That unit is more quiet than this one is and it is smaller. It does not handle varied sizes and that recepticle is quite small.)  The Swingline unit is very easy for the children to use and we do not have problems with jamming--I stopped using electric sharpeners in the classroom for several years because of jamming.  The swingline sharpens pencils smoothly as well.UPDATE #1:After using this a bit longer in the classroom I feel the need to update the review. The sharpener jams up and stops working. Sometimes leaving it idle for a short time is enough and we can then sharpen a few pencils but other times we go for days with it not working. Although this is in a classroom it does not get heavy use as we have more than shaprener in the room. It seems that the sensor for activating the sharpener is really faulty.UPDATE #2: this sharpener tends to implement the safety that prevents it from ""overheating"" a bit too readily.  After two pencils being sharpened, it often shuts down.  Although it has various openings, it also is a bit ""touchy"" about how the pencil is inserted.  My original rating is 4 stars but I think I would have to reduce that to 3 stars.  I find my cheaper units to be more reliable.A custodian knocked the unit onto the floor and the black plastic around the opening cracked. If the plastic is held just right it will partially sharpen still.  I think it is disappointing that the motor is OK but a crack in the housing prevents us from still using this unit.",0,0

R1SKI7AXG5BFCY,"Two minutes ago the plastic channels that were supposed to hold the plastic + poster + backing sandwich together let go. Three channels, the plastic, and the poster fell to the hardwood floor -- the corner of the plastic shattered and the poster was folded under and creased. This is a poor design badly implemented because the channels were loose from the beginning and the plastic was too thin. With nothing but friction to hold the channels in place I should have known that failure was inevitable. Thicker plastic or tighter channels or thicker backing or some sort of ridge on the backing for the channels to grip might have salvaged the design but now it is too late.

R3Q9M8LIK8EW6N,"I wanted to like these, but...I bought a 2-pack of the Linkyo HP-compatible toner cartridges for my HP2035 laser printer. Good price, good reviews, I thought. The first one worked rather well and seemed to yield the promised 2,300 pages. The second one, however, immediately put a series of dark gray blotches along the right margin of the page, 7 in all, each about 3/4"" wide. The more pages I printed, the worse they got, clearly a defect in the remanufacturing process. (I'm a retired quality assurance manager. A 50% defect rate in a random sample of 2 items is not a good sign. It could be that I just happened to get the random defect, but... In normal sampling inspection, 1 defect in a random sample of 2 would usually cause the entire lot to be rejected, depending on the specified Acceptable Quality Level, or AQL.)The bottom line is that I can't use toner cartridges that leave blotches. Period. Linkyo's price advantage pretty much vanished when cartridge #2 failed the minute it was installed. I have never had a problem with genuine HP cartridges and I don't consume them so quickly that the cost per year is an obstacle.As I said, the first one of the two was just fine.

Went to print IMPT LEGAL DOCS at 2330, and found 2 cart's BAD...played around with printer [ which WAS working fine previous, as I said] and just wasting more time troubleshooting. PURPOSELY bought BRAND HP to PREVENT problems and have peace of mind... SCAM.  I did also buy an HP 950XL black at same time [ off other vendor and WORKED FINE...  guess will go back to aftermarket and take my chances.

R2AZ3CAXQX8WX7,"Love Amazon, have been disappointed a few times but figured that was normal.  I bought these “non-slip mats” to try to get some organization around my chair.  As a retiree, I do pretty much everything from my recliner.  Info said it holds 5#.  I put one on the side of the table beside my chair, thought I could put my “power button” there and be able to find it easily, instead of having to search for it.  Stuck for maybe 1/2 hour.  The picture shows my power button.  Definitely not 5#!  Replaced mat, same thing.  They are supposed to be reusable, so I pressed a phone charging cable to it.  Didn’t hold for 5 minutes.The mat feels and looks like a much thicker and hardier material that’s like what your credit card is stuck to the paper with when you get it in the mail.  The mat sticks to the table fine, it just doesn’t hold anything.  Maybe it would if I put it on the top of the table, but that kind of defeats the purpose of “it sticks anywhere.”I’ve read both good and bad reviews, but chose to take the chance.

RBUJ7XIZH1SKS,"Looks pretty, but beware of the spiral-binding - I immediately noticed that it ""sticks"" every time I try to open or close the cover.  The pages turn just fine, but the cover - which is a very nice soft suede-like material, is thick but flexible enough that it will kind of grab the spiral rings if you are not careful.  It sounds like nothing, because of course you can work around it, but it is super-annoying if you don't want to keep it open all day.Another problem with the spiral binding, IF you keep it open all the way, is that it sticks up pretty high, and if you are right-handed it will get in the way of you writing on anything close to the middle of the page (in this case Tuesdays and Saturdays).  I imagine that for southpaws this problem won't rear its head until around March.Maybe the design is meant to be used so that the cover is folded open back on itself?  Sounds good, but it sticks that way, too, and when you have it open to one page you don't get to see the whole week, as the left page has Mon, Tues, Fri, and Sat, and the right page has Wed, THurs, Sun, and Notes.  As such, you can't get a full picture of the week without keeping it wide open.A huge missing feature is some sort of built-in bookmark, or other way of easily going to the current week/day.  It needs a ribbon, or some sort of tear-off corner perforation.  Otherwise, you have to search for it using the monthly tabs, but every moth is at least 5 pages and it seems like extra work.Major holidays are listed in the back and printed on the dates, but right off the bat I noticed they left off nationally observed holidays. - notably Friday July 3rd, when offices are closed for the long weekend.  I don't know what other ones are missing, but it doesn't give me confidence that this planner will give me a heads-up when I need one.Just now, when I went to take a last look at the cover of the book for this review, it stuck on the spiral rings four or five times before i could actually close the book!

I'm pretty tall so it wasn't really an issue - and I have a height adjustable desk, so I was able to easily adjust everything to fit.The reason for the review is I have had these for 19 months - and a few weeks ago, I started noticing grease on my carpet and getting on my socks (I work from home, no shoes) then I started finding little ball bearings on the carpet.

R7J68TGGPS1KK,"I do not write reviews, but I'm writing one for this pen because of how terrible it is. Don't get me wrong these pens write very well, however after only a few days of using one of the pens the cap didn't want to stay on tight. It was so loose that I could hold the pen by the cap and it would fall out of the cap. I said whatever and tried a second pen; this one did the same thing. Well here I am now with 12 pens that are still pretty full, but the caps do not stay on. I wish I could use these because they do look cool and write well (the reason I'm not giving it 1 star), however I can't just hold onto a bunch of pens without caps.",0,0

Once I printed a test page (see video), I immediately noticed that the toner didn’t fuse properly to the paper. It literally rubs off with a light touch of your finger. Just to make sure it wasn’t a printer issue, I reinstalled the old original OEM cartridge to get a fresh print, and had no issues with the output at all.

RJ4GXXHNJN4LM,"Well, what can I say, it's the first bad review I've given for a 3M product.The rolls of tape inside these are 300 inches, which means they are much less than the standard 450 inches.On top of that, they are not so simple to use.  One has to pull out the white tab, to which the tape is stuck, then pull the tape free from the tab.  After that, it's pull and tear as before.Before you fold the white tab back in to close the dispenser, you have to make sure the tape is tucked down against the tab, or it could fold stick-side in, which is no good.All in all, a poor design.  perhaps they can redesign it so one doesn't have to mess with a tab, or ensure that the tape is tucked a certain way upon closing, but until then, I'll be sticking with the standard dispenser.Keep in mind, the tape (apart from being shorter than normal) is just fine.  It's the dispenser that's sub-par.",0,0

RPDEL21YBRKZF,"Kay, I know my review is going to be seen as a bit harsh, and to be fair it IS but... this calculator cost me about $180 and for all of it's capabilities and their utility to me. I may as well have bought a $40-60, or used my computer.I am in a hard statistics class, and an equally difficult engineering class. One day I had discovered that I had lost the TI-92 I had bought years ago in high-school. I loved my TI-92 and it had proven useful well into college. I bought this because I had thought it was the most advanced calculator that TI had offered, and I had a test that day and NEEDED something to use to check my math. I expected it to have all of the functionality of my TI-92 at the very minimum.I was happy to discover that I no longer needed to use the TI-92's unnatural grammar to perform integrals, and sigma additions. (With all of the , separating clauses) Then I attempted to do a definite intigral between two numbers, and hit enter.""Unsupported on this calculator. Buy TI-nspire CAS""I cussed, then I flipped through the options, and chose indefinite intigral, figuring I could calculate it myself.""Unsupported on this calculator""I threw the calculator down on my desk with enough force to draw the attention of the TA who was giving the test. Honestly, the durability of the thing surprised me, it did not break.After a quick explanation as to the source of my behavior, the TA decided, fortunately, NOT to throw me out of the test. I continued the test, solving the integrals by hand, unlike any other student in the test, who were all equipped with the 'class recommended' TI-89. I ran out of time with a third of the questions unsolved.I'd return it, but the box is opened, and I don't have the receipt.Thanks TI! Thanks to you I only scored 61.2% on a test that I could have probably gotten about 90% on had I had a proper calculator that could do everything your more primitive models could do! Maybe you should include the fact that it's been bricked/crippled in the packaging PLEASE?DO NOT USE THIS if you need integral support!",0,0

R2VCNVCMLDSCOU,"I had previously purchased two rotring pro pencils (in matte black) that I REALLY liked, but that my youngest daughter managed to lose (both...such is life). As I'm currently taking a math course I decided to splurge on the rotring 800 (silver) because the previous rotring pros were so comfortable to use even for long periods of time (I also explicitly tell my youngest that she's not to draw using THIS one). I have purchased two of rotring 800s, the first arrived last week Monday, and the second pencil arrived yesterday afternoon. Within days of receiving the first I noticed I was constantly having to screw the components of the pencil back together, and by Thursday the feeder mechanism stopped working. I liked the look & feel of the pencil (when it wasn't coming undone), so I ordered a replacement thinking maybe that one was a dud. The replacement arrived Sunday 27 Sep, and instead of working on my math homework this morning, I'm writing this review, because within minutes of starting my work, the pencil came and kept coming undone. I was tempted to put loctite on the threads, but I didn't think the seller would accept a return if I did. I shouldn't have to use loctite to keep my pencil from falling apart in my hand. I feel like a Scooby-doo villain chasing Scoob and the gang through multiple doors in a haunted mansion.

But as all things American these days it looks darn good doing nothing well.  The latest I got back from support is the reason I can't export files is because Mozy is on????  What???  So a software I can't turn off due to the fact that it is controlled by our network admins has to be off in order for Neat 5.7 to save a file.

Had to be connected directly to the back motherboard I/O panel in a 2.0 port. Funny thing is that the preview window will start showing the document you're scanning and then it will just disappear and throw out a ""Hardware Not Found"" error.Be prepared to restart your computer at least once. Plug it in? Have to restart with it plugged in before it will work (Hardware Not Found error). Calibrate it using their sheet? Have to restart... Still throws out the Hardware Not Found error every now and then but usually can just try again and it works (with single sheets at least).So far I've only had success using their cable and since I have to plug it in at the back of the tower it makes it a bit tricky. Now that I know I have to restart the computer every time I plug it in it may work with a different micro USB cable but I haven't tested to be sure.Pros:Gave it 2 stars because eventually after 20+ minutes on hold with tech support I did manage to figure it out and get it to work before tech support even picked up (hint - restart your computer). Scans didn't come out bad but getting the entire sheet to scan is a bit tricky and has to be lined up just right or you may cut off an edge.Overall:Simply do not buy this.

R33MN3NMHW5NFS,"I have used fountain pens exclusively since 1957, when I was a seventh-grade student. I bought this Parker 5th Generation pen in all good faith that I was getting something new. What a rip-off. Total rip-off. Do not buy this, under any circumstances. Ink cartridges for this pen cost me $8 apiece. On April 27th I installed a new ink cartridge in this pen. This cartridge cost me $8. Since that date, I signed exactly 30 computer-printed checks and endorsed 10 of them since they were payable to me. I was unable to sign my 31st check since this $8 ink cartridge was dry. As for me, I will go back to using one of my traditional ink pens. Once all of my remaining horribly expensive ink cartridges are gone, I will throw my $190 Parker pen into the garbage and charge this up to having endured a terrible experience. Sadly, this might well not happened for several months since I have nine of these ink cartridges on hand which I bought for a total of $72 not including those other cartridges which went dry. Incidentally, I have seen those infamous ink cartridges offered for sale at Amazon.com for as much as $10 each.

I could not figure out why they did not work, so looked through other reviews where I learned that cartridges are made for different countries. My new box is labeled ""z10 For use only in U.S. and Canada"".  Again, should be no problem - I live in the US, bought the printer BRAND NEW in the US.  So I look at the old, empty ink cartridge and it says ""z20 For use in Europe, Russia, CIS, Middle East and Africa""!!  I look at the Black cartridge that does not need replacing and there is NO country code on the cartridge.  Now I am stuck with an expensive 951 Combo Pack with no way to return them.  In clicking on the item today, there is nothing in the picture or description indicating the country code if I ""bought it again"".  I have bought these cartridges 2 times on Amazon, so why did they work before and not work now?  How can I buy these on Amazon if I cannot buy z20 cartridges?",0,0
R3KUC9PPPOU51R,"The truth is that I actually adore this mannequin dress form.. however, the reason for only one star is that it arrived in very poor condition. I read over reviews and could see that there had been many issues with others in the past.. but I was holding out that I would be the one to get a mannequin in perfect condition.. unfortunately, I was mistaken. It can in great time, that part was wonderful.. all the pieces were there.. however, the upper part of the wood was deeply cracked, and there were small brown spots all over the front and back of the mannequin bust.. it being white, the spots are very noticeable. I was incredibly disappointed by this! I am a business owner myself and purchased this mannequin for a event, so there was no time to try and exchange it. It looked as if it were a used item. If it were not for the cracked wood and brown spots, this would be a 5 star, amazing purchase.",0,0
R1HK9M3O6JDXJA,I was so excited to order this product for myself and my friend since we do so many different crafts. We definitly needed to keep our scissors in working order. I was never so disappointed when I went to use the sharpener it did nothing to my scissors . I was so embarrassed to even give my friend hers because it does not do what it says. I have since ordered something different and looked at the reviews this time before I made my purchase. Would not recommend this product to anyone.,0,0
RE70G7J2HCCKF,"This is a product that is intended to hold one's laptop, something that costs hundreds of dollars, sometimes even more than that. And for 32 dollars, what do you get? Screws that are not only so small that you know they'd break if you so much as squished them in your fingers, but so small that even the machine making the holes in the legs couldn't actually do it. Only one of the holes was actually finished, meaning only one of these already pathetic screws was able to be put in.On top of that, we have the legs themselves, which are supposed to ""click"" into place according to the instructions. Instead, as you can see, they don't even fully slide into the hole, let alone make a click to lock in place. On the topic of the legs, the button system is beyond abhorrent, and you will be entirely unable to adjust this with ease, even without a laptop on it. There's also the problem of stability for even a medium-weight laptop. I tried out all the recommended positions for it, and only one worked, which involved me sticking two of the three adjustable legs straight out.I cannot even fathom how people gave this such great reviews, because a 10 dollar product I bought to compare this to works infinitely better. Stay far, far away from this.",0,0
R142TA1U9YN8MS,"Every single pen dried up after just sitting at my desk for 4 weeks. (AC runs daily) I used them once to test the colors and they were great. The colors were very bright just like the reviews. I put them aside to save them for fall semester. I decided to take them out and use them last night (almost 5 weeks later) and every single one is completely dry. I cannot use them at all. I tried to scratch at paper with them for a while and a little color would come out of a couple of them, but then turn dry again. The opportunity to return them has passed. It's too bad because I really like this product.  I will have to shop for them somewhere else now. $12 for pens that you can only use one time is not worth it!",0,0
R2OI71MW1VENEZ,The item arrived quickly and installed without any problems. They worked for the first couple pages I printed. Then I started to get cartridge errors. I had to eject the cartridges several times and turn the printer off/on a few times to finally be able to print the return label from Amazon? I was really hoping for better results after reading all the positive reviews but I guess this is one of those time you get what you pay for. Fortunately they started malfunctioning in time for me to be able to return them for a refund.,0,0

R2W85FK07EE09X,"These are really not good!!! As other reviews say the positives are:Lovely selection of coloursNice and brightChunky nibs with a fine point - the nibs are impossible to push inside the pens.The pens wash off clothes nicely if washed immediately.The negative is: THEY DO NOT WIPE OFF YOUR WHITEBOARD.Which for me is the a HUGE problem and means they are a product you can't actually use! They just smudge everywhere, and that's if you wipe immediately. If you leave for 20 mins or so until fully dry, little hands will not be able to wipe them off at all! I use my kitchen work top spray and a wet cloth! Then you have to dry the surface afterwords or they don't work.I bought these because they are Crayola, so I'm disappointed they are really bad!!",0,0
R1987LDC2176IM,Too flimsy and light weight. Works very poorly.  You have to put it squarely on a flat surface and hit it hard to staple anything.

R33NNBXY14Q8F5,"The ""Redi-Tac technology"" is actually just stickers/clear tape which will temporarily tape to the brown plastic surface. There is no further explanation in the ad which is smart look in terms of marketing but actually confusing. The picture shown in this ad, especially the envelop opening up in the back, shows it's a silver cross-shape that will attach to the square area. However, when I got the envelops, they are just clear stickers and it doesn't look like the picture I reviewed carefully before purchasing. If you are just sending a piece a paper it might work for you, but unfortunately not everyone buying envelops just for that. I asked for return and I don't think I should be responsible for the shipping fee due to the misleading image from the product advertisement. However, they just claim there is nothing wrong with the picture and ask me to pay for the shipping, which is the same amount as I paid for the product ($15.52) before tax, if I want to return the envelops. Never recommend this to others.",0,0

R1IVTUXHH6HM0O,"I love the idea that this product represents.I've owned and used this company's products since 2006, gone through problems periodically since then, but always found a way to blame myself for the issues encountered - such as not saving backup files often enough, upgrading to a new version before reading the docs for database conversion, etc. (You should read the other reviews here - plenty of them - to see what I mean).  NO LONGER.  I have a backup file for almost every day for the last year -- 300+ GB of backup files.I can only read one of the files from last April.Now, what to do for tax season?  I'm screwed.DON'T rely on this.  It's a nice toy, but if you're doing real business, keep your paper just in case, and export from the Neat company program often (generate the reports and file them every month).I actually feel bad for the sales and support folks there - they tried to help me, but the program itself is not up to the quality of the other parts of the company, from what I can see.  Yes, we went around the block twice with the paid customer support call, with them remoting into my computer to see for themselves, only to tell me 2 hours later ""there's nothing we can do"" - valiant attempt, but no result.If you are tempted to buy, I'd STRONGLY recommend you read the other reviews.  If you believe me? DON'T BUY.At the time of this writing, there are 48 five star reviews, and 47 one star reviews.  This is a 1-star review, so now it looks like the score is even.  Maybe I'll try them again in a decade or two if they are still around.  For now, I'm off to buy a Fujitsu and see if it's any better.",2,1

R2UZAXHADV9PF6,"I'm normally never a 1 star rating type of person, I generally feel like it's somebody exaggerating their point.  But based off of Amazon's descriptions of each rating, 1 being ""I hate it"" I went by that standard.  I was given this product at work because it was an inexpensive solution to a tiered file folder holder. DO NOT GET THIS. Standard sized folders just barely fit on the legs, so while you're working the slightest knock, of the folders, either while doing work or while grabbing a different folder out, tend to send multiple folder's corners dropping between the legs, leaving a very messy looking setup.  Trying to fix the fallen folders tends to knock more off. It causes more time then i'd like to admit fixing and refixing the folders.  I end up feeling like those bumbling idiot characters from over-acted infomercials- ""does this happen to you??"".Eventually I just purchased a higher quality and much more expensive version on my own and have been extremely happy ever since.  The version I got was the Safco Products Onyx Mesh Desktop Organizer with 8 Tiered Sections. If you're anything like me and work better when things are in their place then I recommend not wasting your time and energy with this one.",0,0

R2JFZ6NK524CE9,"I purchased this product in Oct. 2014 based on the low price and fair customer review. They worked fine.However, I recently refilled these Inkuten cartridges and found out some issues. I later learned that volume for genuine cartridges are as follows: 950XL 53ml, 951XL 17ml, 950 24ml and 951 8ml or 8.5ml (depending on colors). For these Inkuten cartridges, I was only able to re-fill about 23ml to 950XL and 8ml to 951XL. I suspect this product misrepresents cartridge model numbers.I don't know whether others experience the same thing I do. With the real ink volume these cartridges hold, which is equivalent to 950 and 951. The price is not good anymore.",0,0

R93B0V8766DLY,"As with other reviewers, the glue attaching the leg holders to the glass came unglued with very minimal handling.  I bought two which are side by side under my new big screen TV, and both came unglued.  I tried using the bonding glue that you use with a blue light, and even that didn't hold, probably because the light can't permeate through the black plastic.  It will be a hassle to disconnect and move my TV and components to try other glues.  Obviously Fitueyes is having the same trouble I did with finding a glue that will stick.  I actually ordered three, and received one clear glass monitor riser from Fitueyes.  It  has four nice stainless-steel-looking round legs at the corners, and works beautifully in my office.

R3OUS1Q6XF282K,"I bought this for my professional drafting class. Over all it's a decent enough set, for the money it costs. I did not like the mechanical pencil, the lead slipped out frequently and it was difficult to reload the lead. And the lead snapped off soooo much. The compass is okay, it doesnt really lock in place and while it performs its job it can be a bit sloppy at it. The rest was all fairly decent, performed their jobs without issues. What I liked the most was the white eraser. It works SO WELL, didnt rip even my thinnest papers, and cleanly erased without leaving smears or stains. If I had bought this for the eraser it would have been four maybe even five stars simply because of how nice the eraser really is. But the fact the the majority of what I used frequently doesnt work much for needs makes this a 2 star item.",0,0
R14RB32NQ2G6I8,"I bought a HP 10A laser cartridge from one of the Amazon marketplace sellers that shipped via Amazon prime.What I got was a cartridge that produced printouts with blotches and horizontal lines all over the page.  A closer examination of the box showed that it had a date code from 2007, a hologram style that is several versions old, and a color scheme that does not match the picture in the Amazon listing.  Yeah this cartridge was unused and in a sealed box, but selling a nearly 6-year old cartridge as ""New""?  That is a bit much.  You can read on the HP web site that the shelf life is 2.5 years for unopened cartridges, and 6 months for cartridges that are open.This has been a monumental waste of time.  Now I am stuck with $100+ being held hostage while my expired and defective 10A cartridge is being returned.So please learn from my mistakes.  Here is some advice:1) Beware sellers that have disclaimers that their product has a different color scheme than the listing.2) Be sure to check the date code on the box when you receive your order.3) Visit the HP web site devote to cartridge piracy - you can find full descriptions of the HP holographic seals (and you might find out that your cartridge was not intended to be sold in the country you bought it in)4) Note that even sellers that ship from Amazon via Amazon Prime can be selling you out of date garbage.Say, maybe paying $150 at your local office supply store for a HP 10A does not sound so bad after all.  You can see the box, read the date, and there is a good chance your cartridge will work as expected.Good luck with your purchases.Update 9-21-2013I purchased a second HP 10A cartridge from Amazon after returning my first one.  This time I selected a vendor that had an incredible five-star 100% positive rating for several thousand sales.  I paid more money thinking I might actually get the cartridge that was pictured in the product description.  I was wrong.What I got was another expired HP 10A cartridge with old-style packaging.  This time the cartridge was from 2011 - a whopping 3+ years newer than my original purchase, but still expired by the HP 2.5 year standard.The 2011 cartridge seems to work well enough to keep - I do not want to repeat the hassle of a return like the first one.  Still, I think it is unfair for vendors to sell known expired items as ""New"".All I want to do is buy the item that is pictured at a decent Amazon price.  I know I can go to my local office supply store and buy the exact item depicted in the Amazon listing.  The box will match, the cartridge will be manufactured in 2013, and there will be no installation or return headaches.I have uploaded several photos that show what the old-style boxes, date codes, and holographic seals look like.  If you receive an expired laser cartridge I recommend you give the vendor negative feedback regardless of whether the cartridge works in your printer. These things should not be sold as ""New"".Update 3-11-2015Here I am again 18 months later repeating history with yet another wildly expired HP 10A cartridge I bought on Amazon.  The cartridge I purchased in 9/2013 is about kaput after printing only 4700 pages.  At this point, there is no doubt in my mind that years-expired cartridges do not perform nearly as well as new ones.So like a dummy I bought yet another HP 10 cartridge from one of the marketplace vendors with a good rating that was fulfilled by amazon.  This time I got a cartridge with a manufacture date code of April 2005 – nearly 10 years old!  It is absolutely ridiculous that this cartridge was sold as new on Amazon.  I refuse to load it into my printer for fear it will hurt the mechanism.Here I am stuck shipping the thing back for a refund.  That $150 new cartridge from my big box office supply store is looking better and better.  I would gladly buy a new one from Amazon, but apparently that is not possible.Good luck with your purchases.",0,0

R3DH091MG44EN7,"If the box wasn't so heavy, such that returning it would be simpler, I would return this item.  It was shipped with the lock locked before the lid was closed, so the lid was sitting on the lock bar, which bent it so I could not unlock it (the keys and instruction booklet are taped to the outer packing material, so I don't see why this was done).  Once I bent the lock bar a bit, I could open the lock, but the bar disappeared within the cheap lock housing and would not come out.  On top of this, the lock / key is very very cheap, and I could barely get the key in the lock (one key will go in, the other won't). To top it off, the lid is very heavy, and there is no usable molded lip to lift or let it down w/o smashing your fingers.  With a few design changes this would be a great box.For me, the unique must-have features about this were the 1hr rating and its ""legal paper"" size.  And that's why I'm going to keep it.  If all you need is a box for regular letter sized paper, avoid this and related models.",0,0
R2GOP8L2EGXP6U,"Unfortunately, as  we are still on lockdown,  I can’t go to the shops and buy one in person for... half the price! I can’t believe I paid £14.99 (at time of review) for this.Why I am not sending it back? Because I can’t stand the mess on my desk any longer, so, I’ll use it. But believe me, if there had been no lockdown, I would have sent it back as soon as I opened it and would have headed to the nearest pound shop.First of all, it is small, though my mistake, I relied on the seller’s pictures and the pictures in the reviews instead of checking the measurements.Second, it is cheaply made. The little square drawer catches and is stiff to open and the finish is not very well done.  Also, it can’t even hold a business card.Thirdly, unless you have a carton back up on your A4 and put it upright, loose sheet of A4 just collapse. See my picture. Of course, I could have cleverly put a ruler in front of the papers...Lastly, it is not that sturdy. Easy to bend. It is not even pretty in real life. Just white mesh.My advice is that if you can wait, go to any home stores, market or pound shops and buy the same thing  for maybe a fiver or less.Believe me, If you saw this in a store for £14.99, you wouldn’t buy it.How did this get so many glowing reviews?Granted, it is useful but it is not that special and the fact remains that it is a cheap item. We have the right to expect quality for £15. So, a total rip off.I know that one star is a bit harsh. If the item had been priced up to £5.99 , I might have rated it 2 or 3 stars.

R1H1CP0O9MY5Q5,"Long term user of NeatReceipts (then NeatWorks, now just Neat).  Have endured through all the upgrades from Version 1.something, some easy, some not.  Have always found the interface very poor, non-intuitive, restrictive, and just plain painful to use.  Always been a bit nervous about the included corrupted database repair tool.  What is that warning me about?  But N/R could scan directly to PDF when nobody else could, so we have stuck with it.  Have awaited the promised Version 5 upgrade for more than 2 1/2 years.  If you check for updates from Version 4.9.+.+, it declares no updates available.  At the time of this writing, you have to find the upgrade to Version 5 under Downloads on the Neat website yourself.  Then the fun begins.You must ""purchase"" the free upgrade for $0.00 through multiple screens/pages.  Then it is off to your e-mail account to wait for the download link.  But, wait, what arrives is not a link; it is just the acknowledgment that you have purchased the free upgrade, and instructions to wait more for a future e-mail that will tell you how to proceed.  Oh, and if it never comes, please e-mail Customer Service.  Eventually the e-mail with the link arrives.  But wait!  Link is not a link direct to a download - link is to screens where first you must type more info into more little boxes on more screens.  Hey! Aren't we here because we are already a registered purchaser of an eligible previous version?  Lots of keyboarding and mouse moving and mouse clicks, and we eventually get to a real download link - a 132MB download. Fortunately, we have truly fast internet, so not too long a wait.  Except!...the download never completes.  The old let's get to 99%, hang there forever, then stop responding trick.  Alright, cancel this download and start again.Okay, the second download attempt succeeds.  We are now 52 minutes into something that should have taken 1 minute and 52 seconds.  We find the downloaded .exe file and start the actual upgrade.  But the install app first launches a conversion of your previous databases to the ""new"" format.  Yikes! we do have back-ups, don't we?  Oh well, at last begins the actual program install.  Lengthy install with lots of non-movement on the progress scroll bar - includes an un-install of the previous version.  Remember, it is 132MB  before unpacking, so have patience.  Sure hope this works - since our databases have already been ""upgraded"".  No going back now.  It does eventually finish.  Hooray!  We hope.Click the desktop icon and let's see what's new.  Wait, wait, wait.  Hard drive is running, something is happening.  Like the versions before it, this one seems to need some considerable time to gather itself together before making a screen presence.  Okay, we have been here before; we'll wait.  Ahhh, here's the opening screen now.....well, uhh, no, not actually.  It's a REGISTRATION screen!!??  A registration screen where we must chose the registration key we will use for this installation from a (non-functioning) drop down box that lists only the registration key that we have already typed in twice before.  Plus we are required to 'name' this computer and name its 'location' - okay, let's try 'Bob's Desktop' on 'Bob's Computer'.  That seems to work.  Now we click on the hugely over-sized Registration button and we are done.  Right?  Yeah, no, what?  Nothing. Yeah, nothing.  No Internet activity, no flashing modem lights, no nothing.  Click, click, click, clickity click, click, click.  Yep, nothing!  And this is taking place in a small FIXED size box in the middle of a 24"" widescreen monitor.  You can't re-size the registration box - it is fixed in size and it is too small for its own contents, so you have to scroll up and down and left and right inside the box, and it is apparent there is more to the underlying screen, but you can't get to it.  Great coding, NEAT guys. Is this the new interface you have been trumpeting?Okay, try to close the little box - can't; dialog box presents itself to scold me for not completing the registration.  Override the objection and close out anyway.  Re-boot the computer. Click on the NEAT icon and wait for the program to open.  But, instead...a REGISTRATION screen!  Now it shows that Bob's Desktop located on Bob's Computer has been registered with the original registration key, but before you can proceed, you must name and place and register this very same computer (Bob's Computer) using the very same registration key from the very same non-functioning drop-down box as before.  And, of course, clicking on the huge Registration button (suspect something is really amiss here!) produces the same nothingness as before.  Are we relishing and reveling in NEAT productivity yet?Ring! Ring! Ring! Hello, NEAT Support?  What? Oh, HAL the NEAT computer is saying their working hours aren't the same as mine.  I should call back when it is convenient for them.  Or stay on the line if I would like to hear them say that again.  Endlessly.So, here I sit after 396MB of downloads, two obviously failed installations, multiple registration attempts, growing angst about converted databases I can't access, one dead-end tech support call, and a missed dinner.  It is now dark outside.  I started this ultimately pointless exercise in broad daylight.  I am slowly understanding that NEAT software did indeed take me to a previously unattained level of productivity as promised.  I can't recall such a frustration-filled absolutely zero-productivity day before.  My failed installation aside, NEAT's hugely overly complicated repetitively multi-stepped upgrade process alone should warn you away.Follow-up:  Finally succeeded in completing an installation on a Win 7 laptop over an existing version 4.7.  Discovered that many of the earlier version's unique and useful features have been dropped.  Forward in complexity; backward in usefulness and features.  Still, I conducted another WIN XP SP3 Desktop installation attempt.  Started with a complete un-install, then attempted a clean installation.  Upgrade refused - said it was already installed!  Did a registry search to remove fragments, then tried again.  Now it says that this is an upgrade and it can't find a previous version installed.  Okay, that's fair and not unexpected.  So I did a full installation of version 4.7 SP8, then attempted another Version 5 upgrade.  As I said, just a repeat of above debacle.  Shampoo, rinse, repeat.  It's time to get out of this shower.If you think this is a long review, think of the long hours I spent trying to upgrade.  NEAT tech support had been absent through all of this.  Can we give negative stars? Lots of them?Compare the large number of negative customer comments for any and all of the NEAT products with the astonishing almost 100 percent positive comments for the Fujitsu ScanSnap.  Wow!  Guess that's where I'm headed now.SAD SAGA UPDATE Nov 9, 2011 - Received from NEAT Support""Response Via Email(Doug) - 11/09/2011 02:31 PMHello,We have reports from customers with similar feedback and we do apologize for anyinconvenience this may cause you, but the developers are currently working on anupdate to the software as a resolution, which will address the issue; as we dosee this is as a high priority.""Remember, this update has been more than two and a half years in the making, longer than the development cycle of most software.

RYR0QSB1QAI49,"This pencil sharpener did not last for me, and while it was working, it didn't do the best job.  There's better pencil sharpeners out there. I'd hardly go by the reviews that were just testing this out--check out the reviews that used this one for an extended time, like in a classroom such as I have.It's not the sharpener's fault that they don't make pencils like they used to, and many have off-center leads.  However, you can get sharpeners that handle those pencils much better than this one did.  In a classroom setting, it was maybe sharpening about 70% of the pencils.  The other 30% it would sharpen down to nubs with no success.  The replacement that I got for this one sharpened about 98% of pencils.The motor on this one would also occasionally go out.  Granted, it would always come back on after resting.  In a matter of months, though, this one was really working hard to do the minimum.  There was a clear deterioration of the power and the motor.On the plus side, this one did keep chugging along, doing the bare minimum.  I ended up passing this one on to another teacher who was in a desperate situation, and she said she actually liked it.  The pencils were so difficult to sharpen that she could be assured no student was getting up to sharpen their pencil that didn't really NEED it sharpened.Now, it's not like this got used to death.  I have a small special education classroom, so it had moderate use.  It was also difficult for some of the children to align the pencil correctly, and some of the pencil-width settings seemed somewhat random and unnecessary--you could change the width with an inner wheel (the orange wheel you see in the picture on top), but the outer hole is fixed.  It's almost more of a gimmick than a real function.I'd recommend passing on this one--there's better sharpeners for a similar price that do a better job.",1,1

R2CWLKZE5VF2HK,"2021 Review:Update:  I have lowered my rating to 1 star because Jarbo has not responded to numerous emails, including those asking for a delivery receipt and read receipt.  If you have a problem, it looks like they will not respond.This is an update to my previous 5 star review from an earlier order.  Everything was fine with the first pair of cartridges in 2019.  But this time, when I reordered in July 2021, I had problems with a cartridge not detected error message.  First, I would note that the cartridge looks a bit different compared to the first set, including how the chip is installed.  I tried all the usual stuff to try to get it to work, like turning the printer off and unplugging.I suspect there are many folks who would not know how to correct this.  I sent an earlier email to Jarbo support.  I will let them know about the problem.After an hour of fiddling around, I removed the cover plate that houses the chip.  I eventually figured out that the chip was installed backwards with both cartridges.  As soon as I turned it around, it worked fine.Attached are 2 pictures taken from the rear of cartridge with the chip removed and lying on top of the cartridge in front of cartridge slot.  There is a small cover that fits over the slot for the chip which has to be removed to get access to the chip.  The picture with the notches on the chip facing inward is how the cartridge came from Jarbo.  THAT IS WRONG.  The second picture shows the two notches facing outward, which is correct.2019 Review:Has worked fine for me.  At 4,000 ordinary text pages, it is beginning to lighten up.  I use a high quality bright Costco paper, not the super-cheap paper.  I have shaken the cartridge once and it has returned to normal, but typically this does not last very long.  Seller advertises 6,000 pages at 5% coverage.  It is always hard to tell what a particular user's average coverage actually is, so this may only reflect some higher coverage printing that I have done.  But I would rate this as a very good deal.  Will see how subsequent cartridges do.The Samsung print manager program shows that only 50% of the toner has been used.  Not sure how it calculates remaining toner.",0,0
R331GGU60G7JI1,"It came damaged. I blame part of that on the seller and the other part on the manufacturer. The shelves were not separated by anything, so they rubbed the paint off in some spots, the manufacturer should pack it better.The mesh shelf was bend, and the box looked crushed a bit. It wasn't amazon delivery, because the amazon box was fine, just the product box was in bad shape.The top and bottom shelves hold the legs in place. The 4 middle shelves are optional. But they are NOT removable. I have a wire shelf with removable trays, and this is not like that at all. All the shelves slide in from the back, and not the front, and then the back has a bar to keep the shelves from sliding out backward (gravity would pull them out).The top and bottom shelves have backs that are angled correctly. The middle shelves have backs that are not angled correctly. The backs stick out the back of the rack. So the bar that goes on the back cannot mount correctly. By pushing on the bar hard enough to bend the shelf backs, and then cross threading the screw, it went together.I chose this rack because it was the tallest I could find (under 24 inches). But I would not buy again. If this was a 1-time mistake, hopefully, someone will reach out and send me a replacement. But I suspect they are all made this way.I gave it 2 stars because once together, it's fairly solid.  There is a fair bit of tension on that cross threaded screw I could only get 1 turn on. So I wouldn't be surprised if one day it just popped apart.",0,0

Since it was past Amazon's 30 day return window, I sent it to Lamy's customer service center to have it repaired. After two weeks or so I got it back with a note saying that they replaced the ink feed. Well, that fixed the ink flow problem, but the nib is still scratchy. And I tried it on good quality paper and using Noodler's ink. The nib itself looked worn and used. They could of at least given me a complimentary ink cartridge.It's disappointing, especially since I really liked the Lamy Safaris I tried at a stationery store while visiting Japan. Those pens didn't skip and the writing experience was exceptionally smooth. Now, I'm not so sure I can recommend Lamy pens. If you do buy one on Amazon, my advice is to test it right away.

R22FWN1DE66PKG,"UPDATED review on Nov 26, 2013:  I did not use this much (did not work well from the start), but after only a few times of using it to get lint off of clothing and rinsing the gadget per the instructions to ""renew"" the sticky, it no longer had any sticky feel or pick-up power left to it at all. The material that is supposed to remain ""forever sticky"" started to bubble up and peel away from the roller.  Trashed it, not a good purchase.Original review from Jan 1 2013:  Unhandy and does not save time as I had hoped.  It works somewhat, but the ads are very misleading, making it look like this thing works much better than it really does.  The ""sticky"" was quickly lost after making just a few swipes on the area rug.  Once the roller picks up a very small amount of lint, it is no longer ""sticky"" and you are done.  When testing it, I spent more time rinsing it off to renew the ""sticky"" than I did actually using it to pick up lint and hair.  It would have been much faster (and easier)to use the vacuum.

R2ML2MMHQE12X6,"I bought these pens for my daughter who had to do a 4th grade report in cursive and I was totally sold on them and even started using them at work... until...strange things started happening to the pens and any document written w/ this ink.  The ink is heat sensitive and the writing will disappear from the paper if you leave it in the sun or a very warm place. This can be extremely disturbing when you have something important disappear on you. But wait, don't worry, all you have to do is put the paper in the freezer and the ink will reappear.  Those reviewers who think the pen doesn't have much ink have probably left the pens in a warm place like a hot car as I did. If you put the pens in the freezer, the ink will begin to show again.  They are heat sensitive, hence the name Frixion-- they erase by creating heat when you rub the ""eraser"" over the writing.  After about 2-3 months, the pens became unreliable and they finally did stop working altogether.I would not recommend them unless you have a short term use, like a grocery list or ""to do"" list and you can keep it out of the sun/heat.",0,0

RW469ZELEVA7B,"I was dissappointed when I received this laptop stand for several reasons...1) The other reviews are absolutely true that the attached light is totally weak and useless, the plastic this stand is made of is cheap and flimsy, and with the legs fully extended, this stand will topple over at the slightest bump because the ends are rounded and barely touching the surface.2) If you are pear-shaped and full-figured like myself (size 22)or even if you are just very muscular with thick thighs, this laptop will not fit you with the legs extended to the ""first"" position. The hard, rough-edged bottom of the stand winds up digging into your legs, scratching you up and sitting crooked on your lap. In order for you to use it, you have to fully extend the legs out to its last position. This makes the laptop stand too high up to type comfortably unless you lift the split top up to tilt the laptop towards you. Which leads me to the next issue...3) The split top is held up by a single plastic piece (on one side only) that you slide into plastic slots to raise it to different angles (functioning silimilarly like a car hood).  Problem is, this plastic piece is flimsy and your laptop wobbles with every keystroke that you type.  Also, the split top is barely wide enough to fit a 15-inch laptop.  If you have a 17-inch laptop...forget about it! Your laptop won't even stay on the stand in ""split top mode"".Overall, I gave this 2 stars only because for the right sized person, with the right sized laptop or netbook, this stand could be worth it for the price. Otherwise, I wouldn't bother paying for this. You would come out just as good buying a $10 breakfast tray.",0,0

I had to throw out 2 and remake because the transfers wouldn’t properly adhere. Thankfully the t-shirts weren’t expensive but the point really is how much effort, thought, time, money and ultimately total frustration is wasted on the final product even once you think you have a good finished product. Here is an example of 1 of the 3. My 3 kitties pictured in a garden setting.....everything is flaking off. There is no way I didn’t follow instructions to the letter. Firstly, even though Avery does not explicitly emphasize the fabric must be at least partially synthetic, I used 50/50 cotton/poly.  After one HAND WASHING the image is flaking off. I am furious. And now that I have given t-shirts that I have spent hours designing to my 2 friends who also have cats I have to explain to them that the image will probably not last.I must include this...I am a very experienced crafter.

R3R78EIMWPUNR2,"As a perpetually single, 35 year old man with a bad habit of moving all over the country every couple of years, I have never seen a reason to buy a full sized washer. When my trust Magic Chef portable washer have it on me after 4 years, I was looking for a reasonably priced alternative to a full size unit. This one advertised a .2 cu ft lower capacity for a reasonable price, so I thought I would try it out. I am now regretting that decision.The first thing I noticed was the size is significantly smaller. The advertised space is about 90% of my old washer, but I struggle to fit a weeks worth of shirts in it, while I never had a problem with my old machine. I have concerns about what would happen if I tried to put a comforter in this one.The second thing I noticed was the smell. It gives off a very industrial smell whenever I use it. I hope that this will go away in time, and I haven't noticed this small on my clothes, but it makes my laundry room stink whenever I use it.The last big thing I have noticed is the spin cycle is so weak, it is almost useless. I have taken things out, and they are still dripping wet. So wet that I can wring them out with little effort. I was accustomed to my old machine, where things came out very dry. At the end, on that machine, the spin cycle stopped working, and things came out of it only a little wetter then they come out of this one. You can see how much water is left after a normal cycle in the picture. It is a little hard to see, but there is about a a cup of water in the drum on the right. Edit 10/12/2022 I was able to solve this problem by putting the machine on top of a rack. Apparently the water drainage pump is not strong enough to lift the drain water to a standard laundry hookup height, so putting it on the rack has solved that problem. Clothes still come out wetter then I would like, but better. This is a fatal flaw in my opinion, considering I had to spend an additional $80 for a sturdy enough rack on which to put this. I really wish I had spent that extra $80 on a better machine.

R3HB84Z2TT1WJ0,"This product is being sold as an ""Epson Projector Lamp"", which it is not. It is a lamp made by someone else for an Epson projector. Epson makes their own lamps, which is a primary reason I bought the Epson projector instead of a Panasonic. I had two different Panasonic projectors prior to this Epson and grew tired of the extremely high cost of replacing the lamp. I have no idea how this projector lamp will perform. The lamp which came new with the projector failed after 240 hours, so it is possible this one could actually outlast the genuine Epson lamp. That is not my objection. My objection is selling something in a misleading manner, using the product description to deceive people into believing this is an Epson product. It is not. My one star rating is based on that deception, not on actual performance, for which I have nothing to report at this point in time but will update in a few months (or less, who knows) when appropriate. Whether this vendor will still be around at that time is another unknown, and another reason to buy a genuine Epson product.UPDATE 04-05-13: Shortly after posting this review I was contacted by the seller, who offered a substantial discount if I would remove this poor review. I refused. In my opinion, selling this lamp as ""Epson"" is false and misleading and I will not take part in misleading others. The last projecter bulb I used, a genuine Epson purchased through an authorized Epson dealer, just failed at 1750 hours. This bulb is definitely not as bright as that one, and flickers when on anything less than the highest brightness setting. I do not recommend this bulb or doing business with this seller.Update 08-08-14: Despite a definite flicker, which has continued since it was new, this bulb has actually outlasted my last bulb, which was a genuine Epson product. This projector is used nearly every day, two to four hours per day. While not as bright as the original Epson bulb, it has significantly outlasted that bulb and at less than half the price of the genuine bulb, it may be worth the risk to some for the savings. However, a bulb explosion can do damage to your projector. Because this bulb has exceeded by expectations in terms of its life, I am revising my rating to two stars. Marketing a product in a misleading manner cost this product two stars, and the flicker and reduced brightness over the original Epson bulb cost it the final star.",0,0

If it was just advertised as a regular ink, with no anti-feather/anti-bleed guarantee, I'd give maybe 4 stars.  But its not.  The name of the ink is ""X-Feather"", so you'd expected it not to feather, right?  That's the whole purpose of the ink.  But it does.  I experienced feathering and bleed-through on cheap and mid-grade (but still inexpensive) paper with the noodler's black X-Feather.  AND with Noodler's bulletproof American Eel.  NOT using a flex nib, or any other hardware that may make bleeding worse.  Using the pilot metropolitan with fine nib (which is very well made and was brand-new, so not a pen problem).  Not to be a grumpy ink hater (but kind of because I AM grumpy about this), but I don't really understand everyone's hype about the Noodler's X-Feather.

The mouse area was really nice and i even liked the part where my netbook stood. I was able to stand my netbook as high as i wished, without having it fall on me. The legs height was really perfect for me. I recommend for those who use it on their beds to lower the legs whenever you get down from the bed or trying to find a comfortable position.

It may STICK the same way but it is by far a WAY cheaper material. It's like a cheap black trash bag. You have to be exceedingly careful when separating the ""perforated"" sheets because it tears EXTREMELY easily. A previous post was also correct about it letting light in at the edges. I tried to take a previous reviewers advice and cut a little extra to compensate...but it wont stick fully to the window unless all edges are ON the actual window...so you HAVE to cut it a little short. I cleaned my windows very thoroughly and cut all my pieces ahead of time. Since I cut just a little extra I had to remove the piece from the window and cut off the extra since it wouldn't work unless the whole piece was on the window. BIG mistake. This crap will absolutely NOT stick more than one time. I have no idea how people use this more than once. It's on the windows for now (thank goodness for ten sheets) but there's light peeking in everywhere. I'm sure my kids will mess with it and it will fall off...and when it does I will be going back to the aluminum foil method. MUCH less costly and MUCH more effective. Total waste of $60+ dollars.",0,0
R16MCDZIMGZXX4,"Reading recent negative reviews makes me regret wasting my money. Replaced the original with this hunk of garbage. It was dimmer right out of the package so I cleaned the projector. Re-seated the bulb, still dim. We figured it was just part of saving a few $100 bucks... a few dozen hours later, it died. Hurray! My lack of faith in people was substantiated! Nothing like a good ""I told you so"" from my wife...Either the other reviews are canned, or these are seriously just a gamble and some people get lucky.

R3DGQ4Z6LCN9SD,"Similar experiences with what others have already commented on - I am not giving the printer a 1 star because if did perform very well for about 2 years.  But afterwards, the quality of the printing developed numerous lines and smudges first in the color printing and now in black ink / text printing.  This did  problem did not improve with the recommended online Epson maintenance suggestions.  You also cannot access the printhead because of the printer design.Most frustrating really is that the Epson Customer Service Center required me to go through their online recommendations of printhead cleaning X 3 AGAIN even though it was completed recently and they wouldn't even provide additional options for management until after this was done.  So I wasted more ink for the printhead cleaning with the final conclusion of ""Hmm...needs to be repaired"" from the agent before be provided the information on the closest Epson Customer Service Center or a 15% discount for a new Epson printer.This was my first Epson printer based on recommendations.  It did work well for two years.  But at the end, this was the most I've every paid for an all-in-one printer and am not happy with the price paid for how short of a period of time it has lasted before needing servicing.  What I've read, replacing the printhead (which is what I expect will be the problem) can be upwards to half the cost of a new printer so at this point, a new printer it will be.",0,0

R29C5J2OFWZNM9,"I actually really like the layout and design of this planner. Perfect size/weight, it opens nicely and lays flat, lots of extra room for to-do's and notes... I'm not a fan of the ""law of attraction"" aspect of it, so I don't use the habit making check lists or goal planner portions (logo on the front is also super dumb). Again though - exactly what I want in terms of calendar design.SUPER POOR QUALITY. On day one the elastic band that holds the planner closed broke and the binding is clearly falling apart. I read this in other reviews before buying, but hoped mine would be different. Nope.Average of two stars, both due to the great layout/design. Zero for quality.

R2MZVJYPIVS6EV,"After having a chance to use the cartridges for about a month, I have to revise my initial review. After printing a few photos one day on my HP PhotoJet Pro 8100 the color cartridges started streaking at the top and bottom of the pictures. I ran the print head cleaning cycle several times to no avail. I replaced  FUZOO cartridges with new HP cartridges, again ran the print head cleaning several times and still had the streaking problem. I am retired from the Navy and local school district having worked in the capacity of an electronic/computer tech and have had plenty of experience with many types of printers, especially HP.

R1TZDLZ8IA4J2,"The other reviews are accurate - it DOES pick up pet hair and lint, but really not as effectively as a tape roller. It's not that sticky, so it misses things and you have to roll it back and forth several times. You also have to rinse it off and dry it frequently during use. To get the pet hair off my couch, I had to rinse it at least 7 times and I still had hairs left over, and my cat doesn't shed nearly as much as others. The product photos are definitely not accurate - there's no way it could pick up that type of thick pet dander and leave the surface below completely clean like it shows. That's blatant false advertising. It's really just not that effective, but I guess it's something you could have laying around if you just needed to take a quick swipe of something minor. The Evercare Giant Roll is really the big winner in this category.",0,0
R2V0KVA6ZG3AT8,"I’m super stoked about this journal and it really was a good deal. I wanted to try something in this series of planners and this one is absolutely fabulous! Hands down, the ABSOLUTE BEST planner going imho 😇 .. however, as evidenced in the photos the first “undated month” sheet was not cut very well. This is TOTALLY NOT the sellers fault .  Although it didn’t come with the protective box, it was in the plastic wrap. Furthermore, the piece of paper was folded inside the book (see pic 1) .. I would’ve totally give this. 10/5 literally. This is a fantastic idea! Genius, really! The binding has the perfect amount of tautness and just very sturdy. This speaks of its quality. The cover feels like a super soft silicone and the teal color is fantabulous! I definitely didn’t mind paying the price but totally wish that had been disclosed to my seller and then myself. I honestly never leave less than 4 stars , mostly 5’s, and though I feel terrible about it, I do hope that people will read the review and understand there may be a few flaws but it’s undoubtedly worth the buy!

R3J028IEMQ51P,I was excited to use this lead with my Uni Kuru Toga pencils which I have been using for the past couple years and I was shocked to notice that the lead doesn't quite fit perfectly. My pencil uses 0.5mm lead and this lead is 0.5mm yet the lead is just a tiny too skinny. If I put even a tiny bit of pressure it starts to slowly go back in. I thought maybe it was just this one piece of lead so I used another and same problem. And it continued on.I also thought maybe my pencil somehow was broken in between last using and so I tried using my new lead in my other Uni Kuru Toga pencil but it was having the same problem. I then proceeded to test another set of 0.5mm lead that I had and both pencils worked perfectly fine. I must have gotten a bad batch and the lack of consistency is very disappointing especially considering all the other good reviews for this product.,0,0

R3IILJ8NADBV7B,"This is a great concept and mostly works as described. It's not perfect for me for two reasons. First, it will not suction to our bathroom wall. I assume that's because the wall isn't entirely smooth and, in fairness to Elmer's, the package says in small print this item may fall if attached to an uneven surface (it won't suction at all on our wall).  Second, it would be more useful if the cup was a little deeper.  My goal was to reduce bathroom countertop clutter, and I had planned on using this holder for 3 tubes of creams that are part of my teen son's acne regimen in order to get them off the counter, but still leave them in plain view (because if stored in a cabinet he won't think use them). Two tubes fit but the third is rounded and won't fit, so there's no point using it for that purpose. But what does work well is that this attaches firmly to the mirrored medicine cabinet and holds my son's toothbrush and toothpaste perfectly, so it's functional as it gets those items off the countertop. And I really appreciate that the plastic cup as well as the suction portion remove easily for washing. It's an okay product with a variety of possible uses- though it would be more practical and helpful if it was just a little deeper. I give it 3 stars.Update: I've knocked a star off because this gizmo ultimately wasn't functional enough to bother with it. The toothbrush holder idea I had wasn't as good as I thought as it gets scummy too fast, and I was constantly washing it. For holding pencils or pens, there is nowhere to adhere it to so that it was actually helpful. I put it away and it will end up in the recycle bin eventually.",0,0
R2SQ21F6A6CUGC,"Let me start by saying I am very proficient in my computer skills and office applications. These were miserable to work with. You can't download a template, you have to do it online. That would not have been an issue per se, but it did NOT save my template and colors. When I tried to mail merge my guest list to the template, it worked correctly....the first time. But I realized that I had made a mistake on my list. I corrected it and started my mail merge over. This time and the next 3 times, it wrote the field name ""FIRST NAME"" on my tags, plus my guests last name. I had to go in and manually type in the first name of everyone. I printed them to PDF to make sure everything stayed correct, then printed them to plain paper and held them up to the light with the blank tags in front. They looked like they aligned, but the center section of my design printed as a text box and as a different shade of blue than the rest, and it was all the same color on the screen. Then I printed them onto the sheets, it was only then that I could see the perforations and that my tags did not align to the template. They came out terrible and the texture of the paper made the color even worse looking. So why did i give it two stars instead of one?  Because I can't make it 1.5, and that 1/2 is because the perforations were well done as was the tag hole, the card stock had a decent weight to them, and the template designs look nice.

RXX3AYY8M7J11,"I have to say I'm really disappointed. My purpose behind purchasing an A5 travelers notebook was to carry a journal and a watercolor sketchbook at the same time (I learned for the first time that you can get watercolor inserts on amazon and etsy). I was deciding between this book and one from another company, ultimately choosing this one because I know September Leather is supposed to be a decent company. I don't think I'll be able to purchase from them again because what I received, while still usable, must be a used product.The cover is extremely distressed with scratches and marking throughout, as well as the spine showing clear wear from bending. The little piece of leather around the band is extremely distressed as well. One of the three notebooks included had an unusual stain and a black, charcoal-like deposit between the first page and the cover. I ended up ripping out that first page and in turn lost the back page.On top of this, the cover is not really meant for A5 notebooks. The watercolor insert I purchased is a true A5 size (5.8x8.3 inches) however it sticks out of the cover if I have it installed with the 2 pre-installed notebooks. I should have read the reviews prior to purchasing, otherwise I would have known that ""A5"" refers to the size of the actual cover, not the size of the books it holds. This is rather misleading and further confirmed by the fact that the 3 notebooks inserted are not a true A5 size; the horizontal edge measurement is slightly shorter, possibly around 5.5in rather than 5.8in. Therefore, in order to use my appropriately sized watercolor insert without it being exposed, I have to remove one of the notebooks and only use a 2 notebook system. Luckily for me, I only really need 2 notebooks as my Hobonichi Techo Weeks serves as my planner/journal.Overall, I'm not too happy with this purchase. Is it usable? Absolutely. But if you're a huge notebook/journal fan like myself and have a particular love of leather journals, there are certain things you want to experience for yourself. You want every scratch on your leather to be from your own hands and actions. You want to develop that lovely, aged patina yourself. You want the binding to be weathered as a sign of your frequent use, not someone else's. Receiving a notebook in this condition is a bit disheartening because I'm thinking about all the wonderful things that I am missing out on because of my notebook's current state. I can't even take the time to return it because I desperately needed my cover for my watercolor insert. So this will have to do for now until I have the opportunity to replace it. All I can say now is that this is the last I purchase a September Leather item, unless I receive evidence that I will not be disappointed again.",1,1

RL5ZJTE342H4,"I've used this to frame your typical poster of this size and the frame simply falls apart with time. As the weeks pass, the poster slips further and further down until bottom and side pieces of the frame let loose and fall off. I've had to take the poster out and put it back in, and it happens repeatedly. Since originally writing this review, the frame has fallen apart yet again and broke on the ground. If you have the same experience I'm having, you'll have to glue or tape the corners to keep it all together.I haven't had this issue with any other size frame of the same style. Perhaps it's just the weight of the bigger poster, but I think it's reasonable to expect a poster frame of any size to properly hold the poster it is intended for. I wouldn't recommend this unless you're content with taping it together.",0,0

R33QXE8EC3X0A9,"ORIGINAL REVIEW:  So far so good.  These work fine in our printer once we acknowledge HP's warning about non-genuine cartridges.  Time will tell how well they do.UNFORTUNATE UPDATE:  I initially just swapped a couple of the cartridges, waiting on the originals to be empty before swapping.  The first couple cartridges worked fine (hence the original review).  Then we swapped the old Magenta with this one, and it leaked ink all over the inside of the printer.  Had to spend a lot of time cleaning up the printer.  Tried a different brand of generics, and they were junk too.  Sadly, I had ordered my mother a set of these for her printer, and she had problems as well (thankfully no leaks causing a mess).I finally gave up on these generics and opted to subscribe to HP Instant Ink, and we have a mostly reliable printer again.  I get occasional print defects, but I believe they are the result of damage to the printhead by these junk cartridges (or quite possibly damage resulting from us fiddling around so much trying to get these to work)",0,0

R399RH9NDAATGR,"The idea was good, the execution impossibly bad.Don't waste your time. Seriously. Just don't. If you need more evidence, go check the reviews at the Home Depot website.Let me explain the problem: The ""smaller"" problem is that the pin is built to work by hitting the molding. Since I bought the product specifically to avoid hitting the molding, we already have not met the goal. But the bigger problem is the fact that the pin doesn't stop the door. Unless I want a 45 degree opening in my hallway. This is ideal for a cat, ferret, Dachshund, or Bichon. It barely big enough for my Labrador.As for me, I'd prefer that my hallway door open to a 90 degree angle. Just sayin'. But when I select that setup, the door opens at least 100 degrees, probably 110, possibly 115, but I can't say for sure because the doorknob has already hit the wall (hard) and I'd prefer not to push the knob all the way into the wall just to get a good measurement with my protractor.

R2PIQB2XN2Q992,"After a few writes with one of these pens, the ink started to run out on me and get terribly scratchy. When I replaced the one that ran out (still with full, new ink inside) with a new one from the box, the new one did the exact same thing in the same day of using it for the first time. I ran through several more to only be extremely frustrated that all of pens did the same thing. My friend owns a box of the Hi-tec-c 0.25mm pens, but she bought them for $10 more than this box of G-tec-c's. Before buying these, I briefly looked up reviews, worried that the Hi-tec-c was different than the G-tec-c. I remember seeing people say that there was no difference except that the G-tec-c was the American version of the Hi-tec-c. THERE IS MOST DEFINITELY A DIFFERENCE. My friend gave me four of her hi-tec-c pens and I have run through 3/4 of them with no problem at all and they have become one of my favorite and go-to pens to use. You can see the difference between the G-tec-c and the hi-tec-c in the pictures and how scratchy the G-tec-c is. It is worth paying the extra money to get a box of great, working hi-tec-c pens instead of ending up with a cheaper box of poor quality, runs-out-basically-within-the-hour, G-tec-c pens. Do not buy.

You would expect that since it is for children it would be easy to remove. The only chance is to apply yourself for a few minutes rubbing intensely, which makes it useless because let's face it, the point is to draw and remove constantly, not to paint a masterpiece and let it there for family and friends to see for the rest of eternity. No use in expecting the child to wipe it clean.As for the drawing itself, it is faint and the colour lacks consistency.My son could not have enough of it when we put the whiteboard up.

That much is true - the hanging files fit nicely, so long as you don't want to use the lids. . Once the files are hanging, you cannot put the lid on.Putting the boxes together is easy and for the most part the box itself stays in place.  The upper lip of the box has to be taped down - they don't stay in place.  If you don't tape them down, the 4 lips of the boxes block the opening to the box.The lids have to be taped together because the tabs that go into the slots are not long enough to lock the lid in place.

R3AM0YDE20TSSO,"While browsing for Bluetooth keyboards on Amazon, I noticed loads of tables and stands dedicated to laptop use.  I had previously decided that once I had purchased a keyboard I would need its own little stand, but I was thinking more like a TV tray.  Seeing all those choices, I convinced myself buying one in favor of a cheap TV tray was the right, even responsible, decision.Well, it turned out that that wide array of options were all pretty identical - so I went with the model that had a lot of positive reviews, was qualified for Prime shipping, and was decently priced.  That would be the product I am reviewing today, the ""iCraze Adjustable  Vented  Laptop  Table  Laptop  Computer  Desk  Portable  Bed  Tray  Book  Stand  Multifunctional & Ergonomics  Design  Dual  Layer  Tabletop (Black).""  <---[First red flag, looking back...]When it arrived, I was thankful that the unit was basically pre-built, and all that I, the customer, needed to do was to attach the small (maybe about 5"" squared) mouse pad extension to the table/desk.This was the first ""uh-oh moment"" - there are NO INSTRUCTIONS for this item.  Not a single measly slip of paper, or even a website printed anywhere on the packaging.  My shipping slip was the lone paper in the box.  Attempting to remain optimistic, I hoped that the lack of literature was indicative of just how easy this would be...attach that little mouse pad and all done...oy.Before committing to anything, I studied the product's Amazon page; looking closely at the pictures and reading the more helpful comments.  Many people mentioned the lack of instructions, the lousy mouse pad extension and its enigmatic ways, but I could not find any accurate, tried-and-true procedures.What kept throwing me off was the fact that in EVERY product display picture provided by iCraze, the mouse extension was upside-down, and I was determined to get mine to look like the model...  Well, I'm here to tell you that either the picture provided for this product is of a different model or was assembled with different parts, because the effectiveness of their implied method was paramount to using a Lisa Frank sticker and rubbing a good luck charm.Ultimately, the mouse pad rests precariously atop the table's side, using a lip that fits into a groove on the tray top so it won't fall off.  If you are super delicate, then you are probably alright.  If you move the stand, bump into it, or put too much weight on it, then you will probably not be alright.The next issue to deal with were two small, black, plastic clips that were just randomly provided.  Thinking they were included for balancing the wobbly mouse pad, I fiddled some.  When that failed, I found myself again at the product's page, close to beginning a return/refund procedure.Then, written in a review that was lost in the middle of the pack, I discovered these plastic chunks were supposedly meant for securing a laptop to the table top.  HOW?!  These are not your standard two-prong clips, guys:  these are small, fat, boxy chunks of plastic with strangely shaped sides and a slot that won't even slide onto the stand's top, let alone with a laptop in between!  But I don't use the product for a laptop anyway, just a keyboard & mouse, so no harm.The basic construction design and quality of the iCraze table is my last major gripe, for it is lacking.  At the time of purchase, I had judged from the pictures (again, BIG MISTAKE) that it would be perfect for use in a normal chair.  Sadly, this is not the case.  In my mind, the last of the three sections that make up the legs would fold 90 degrees parallel to the floor, while the other two would be straight upright, thus creating a sturdy and height-appropriate laptop table.  Unfortunately, this is achievable only in a seat made for a small child, as the table's top couldn't reach farther than my knees.Conclusion:  I have yet to decide the fate of this item, but am totally disappointed and feel misled by this company.  Their entire description that they provided should be scrapped.  In its place, a write-up of a nifty breakfast-in-bed tray that has a couple crappy fans.",0,0
RDS3ZP4NECFNX,"Super cheap and flimsy. I’m sure it will hold business cards on a desk just fine, but even for $13, it’s overpriced for what you get.  Plus, they’ve obviously rebranded this from another manufacturer with stickers covering the old branding. Weird and cheap Chinese crap.Also it seems like they switched the product out but kept old reviews. Most of these reviews seem to be for a small personal business card holder that would go in a pocket. But this product is for a full size business card organizer that sits on a desk. Not sure what’s going on there, but the product is a cheap and flimsy desktop card holder, not a small and sleek personal one.",0,0

RVQNB8PJ5PPF4,"I at first gave this product 5 stars, because once you get your images printed on the paper, it does beautifully in transferring them to your sublimation blanks. The colors are great and everything looks fabulous.HOWEVER:  I started out sublimating on an Epson Workforce 30. After a couple weeks, I noticed I was having trouble getting the paper to feed through the printer. I figured there was something wrong with the printer, so I called Epson and since they don't make the Workforce 30 anymore, they 'upgraded' me to a WF-2530.  I got the printer, it printed about a dozen prints and stopped taking the paper through the printer, just like the Workforce.  I again blamed the printer, it was under warranty so they swapped me for another printer, and about 5 prints in, it stopped wanting to take the paper again. I decided Epson printers were no good for the paper thickness, so I ordered a Canon. Guess what? It also did not want to feed this paper.  So after wasting way too much money on refillable ink cartridges and expensive sublimation ink for three different printers, I have concluded that the problem is not the printers, it's this paper.  So if you can get your printer to take this paper, you'll be happy with the results. IF YOU CAN GET YOUR PRINTER TO TAKE THIS PAPER!",0,0

RCAVIM0XEFCUT,"(NOTE: see my update on NeatWorks ver 5 below)I have been using NeatReceipts for a couple of years now.  I generally like the product, but I am now using BOTH the 'Classic ver 1.5.9"" and the new Ver 4.0 software because NeatWorks broke a covenant with its' early adopters.  They broke two of the cardinal rules of product development (1) never, ever, under any circumstances forget your early customers and their data and (2) never remove vital features from the product.First, they ""forgot"" their ""Classic ver 1.5.9"" users.  Versions of the software from 2.0 up thru the current ver 4.1 cannot recognize or import any of the receipts or documents scanned into the earlier version.  I have personally talked to them about this for almost 2 years.  At first, in early 2007, they repeatedly stated that they were hard at work on a migration solution.  We depended on that statement, telling them how important it was for us to be able to access our archived data - for inventories, insurance and tax records.But they finally just abandoned this effort and offered everyone a discount to upgrade to a later version.  How is that going to help with restoring archived data?  The data and file formats for their .elrec and .eldoc seem fairly simple - a scanned image and some recognized text fields.  Why can't they import those formats like they allow for jpeg and tiff images?They offered no acceptable reasons beyond that we are no longer working on that feature and ""would you like to upgrade?"".  They seem oblivious to the frustrations they have caused a large number of their early customers.  We even communicated with Rafi Spero, one of the companies owners.  If he couldn't make it happen, you know they don't care about you as a customer.  BEWARE THIS COMPANY.Secondly:  The ""Classic"" version allowed users to create folders and subfolders, etc.  This was a fantastic way to organize receipts for cash, various credit cards, checks and debits, by year and then by month.  Or to organize a copy of receipts for an inventory by broad categories and then further by store, year or vendor.  So the initial features of both subfolders and the ability to copy receipts from yearly tax records to inventory folders was extremely useful and helpful in elimnating paperwork clutter.The new ver 4 software does not support nested folders or copying receipts to other folders.  Every time you scan a receipt, it goes into a folder.  But all folders are on the same level.  You can show and hide folders, but this is an extremely clumsy process and causes users a lot of extra work in trying to organize their invoices and receipts.  If you want to copy a receipt, you have to scan it AGAIN.  How brain-dead is that?Bottom Line:  This company has proven that, at their convenience, they will ignore or abandon prior versions of the software and remove vital features.To fix some of their current short-coming, as mentioned above, it would not surprise me to see them create a new version of their software that is incompatible with what they are selling today.DO NOT TRUST them with any vital data that you may need in the future.UPDATE:  2-11-2010 - I have been given a preview of the new NeatWorks ver5 software.  I don't know when it will be released but it seems to have (finally) added back in some of the features that went missing with ver 2 and onward.  Now they also have a chance to allow for importing old receipts ("".elrec"" files) from their ""Classic"" users.  If they do Import "".elrec"" files many Classic users will be happy that their data is no longer ""orphaned"".  I will then change my opinion and rating of NeatWorks and their products because they did admit to these past mistakes, listen and respond to their customers and ""the true test of your character is how you respond to those mistakes.""",0,0

R3UFDGM22QPSMV,"UPDATE: I was never contacted by Company/C.S. after review. Be aware: Stickers are NOT included! Will not re purchase.I really like the aesthetic portion of the planner, it's beautiful in its design and it will be extremely useful for productiveness. I have two minor things that made me knock off two stars.First, the grammar mistakes on the cover, such as ""capricon"" and ""pieces"". I believe this should lower the value of the planner, for $35 ish dollars, you expect it to be grammatically correct. Everything else on the inside is precise, as far as I can tell.Second, the advertisement suggests that you will be receiving bonus stickers and I never received any stickers at all. This upsets me because that was a deciding factor between this planner and another planner. This is deceiving and that would have ultimately made me pick another planner, had I known that there weren't going to be any stickers included.As for the pros, I do see myself using this planner because I like the way it is organized. It just works for me. I counted 12 months and it has 5 weeks per month. It seems sturdy enough to where I don't see any future problems with the pages coming off. The binding is very well put. The rose-gold color is gorgeous and it's exactly what I was looking for. I wanted a specific layout for my planner and I'm glad this is able to satisfy that. That being said, I hope customer service acknowledges my 2 complaints. If so, I will be purchasing again next year. To be updated.",0,0

R2HLE2IDRZNKDK,"As other reviewer noted, the instruction manual was a joke.  It had 6 ""simple"" steps that required 100 guesses to get things right.  A great example is when you start out with step number 1, it states 3 different screw sizes are required (all of which fit in all 3 holes) and you get to figure out which one goes where based on analysis of future steps.  It also has you build the thing upside down in the instructions, which makes the instruction easy, but is not practical when you realize you build the little shelf part first and are supposed to somehow build the desk with that on the bottom.  Anyway, finally got it all together and it looks great.  I went to move it into the corner of the room and one of the leg connectors broke.  I can't imagine taking apart and returning so I'm just going to be very careful with it.  Definitely worst instructions I've dealt with in a while which just tends to ruin the whole initial experience.

I could have worked faster with a Big Chief tablet and a No. 2 pencil. So...why this review...to thank everyone who recently tried the 'system' and gave it a lowly review (lots of 1 stars...possibly because you can't give 0 stars).

RN67J2EJCW0TG,"So I had a 'Heavy Duty' chair I got on sale a couple of years back, and I love it. The piston went bad about a year ago, which wasn't a big deal, but then the base became broken a few months ago as well, which made it very wobbly. I bought a new piston and base at the same time because the rest of the chair was still in excellent shape. The piston was rated at 1000 lbs. The base (the product I am reviewing here) was rated at 500 lbs. My original chair was rated at 330 lbs, and boy was that accurate - right after it broke I weighed myself and sure enough I was just TWO lbs over! So I bought what I thought was even better parts than my original, fixed it, and it was great... for two weeks. It became wobbly again, but I ignored it, and last night the chair literally broke off and I ended up on the floor (I am both large AND old, so it HURT). Apparently the metal tore like tissue paper. My old base (OEM) was rated at 2/3 that, and I got almost three years out of it. The 500 lbs rating is BS, and I am VERY dissatisfied (Because now I have to replace it again, and I am very annoyed about that). If your as big as me or bigger, look for another brand - this one is made terrible.

R345K5JLDYOYYQ,Well let's just say you get what you pay for.  This lead is by far the most brittle I've ever had.  It breaks so unbelievably easily.  In addition it seems to slide out much farther than you would expect from one click of your pencil.  That aspect is pretty frustrating considering you have to keep the lead a  very short length if you want to minamize the breakage.  This is especially annoying during exams when your lead keeps breaking and you keep clicking your pencil and then an astronomical amount of lead comes out just for it to break again within 30 seconds.  I'm currently studying for exams and I took the time out of my busy schedule just to leave this review so others know.  If you want a lot of cheap lead then look no further.

Apparently for the same reason so many others did!After loading the software and plugging the scanner into my computer, I opened the Neatworks software but couldn't scan anything because it said no scanner was connected. I fumbled around their support links and tried their troubleshooting ideas with no success. They have no phone # for support, you have to submit an email. It was two hours before I got a response.Their first suggestion was to make sure the power button on the back was on. Seems like a reasonable first suggestion except for the fact that the scanner doesn't have a power button. After trying their other ideas, I replied back that I had no success. The next day I get my next message from them, this time suggesting I try a different power cord. Another great idea except the cord has a unique connection into the scanner.

R1Q43K394UF18N,"I ordered two cartridges the same time.The 1st, which was installed in April was easy to use and change on the Brother printers.The Instructions were clear, unit is clean and offers a green option of returning by mail postage paid for the used oneThe 2nd one I tried to install today (late May) is 100% useless!  I have followed the instructions, and installed it 5 times.

R1WKUYVYIKYBL3,"I bought these pens hoping for something that would work better, last longer and hopefully not smear much, compared to the Sharpie® pens that we currently use.  The claims made on this page were that they are fast-drying, smear and water proof, and permanent for plastic tubes.  More importantly for me, the claim was made that they are also resistant to many chemicals and solvents.  I was pretty excited to try something that might finally work for us.  To test them, I performed the following experiment:I marked seven 13x100 borosilicate (""glass"") tubes with the name of the treatment I would use, along with a patch of black scribble, and additionally stuck a piece of lab tape to each tube and wrote the name of the treatment there as well.  Treatments performed included placing a small amount of each solvent onto a fresh Kim-Wipe and lightly rubbing the patch of scribble as well as the writing on the lab tape, or in one case, I just rubbed a bare-skin finger against the writing to see how it held up to skin oils.  I left one control to which I did nothing.  The solvents used follow:1)  methanol2)  reagent alcohol (90% ethanol, 5% each methanol and isopropyl alcohol)3)  ethyl acetate4)  HPLC-grade water5)  skin-oil (bare-fingered rubbing)6)  control (no treatment, for comparison)Additionally, I added ~5mL of water to another tube, placed it in the -80°C freezer for 45 minutes, removed it and let it thaw for 45 minutes.I then allowed the ink to dry for a few hours, just to make sure it was nice and set.Using a fresh Kim-Wipe coated with the appropriate solvent, against each tube I lightly rubbed both the scribble-patch and writing on the lab tape.  I was very discouraged to see that the writing/scribble was instantly removed on each of the tubes to which non-aqueous solvent was applied.  The tube rubbed with a bare-finger (to see how the ink would hold up to skin oil), the tube rubbed with a water-coated Kim-Wipe and the tube which was subjected to the Freeze/Thaw cycle and subsequently scrubbed with a clean Kim-Wipe (I did not wait for the condensation on the outside of the glass to evaporate) all looked good – pretty much the same as the control, to which I did nothingI went back onto Amazon and re-read the product description and saw that these pens were intended for use on plastics so I went back to the drawing board, and performed the same experiments on some small plastic (polypropylene) 1.5mL tubes, which we use to store aliquots of various things.  Without exception, I got the exact same results.  On the upper-side of each of the 1.5mL tubes is a small, translucent, “frosted” (as opposed to the remainder of the tube which is smooth and transparent) patch, which is where contents information is intended to be written.  This patch also was tested and the results were consistent with everything else here.I took and attached a photo of the glass tubes (again, the plastic ones all had the exact same result, but the glass ones were more photogenic).These pens were over $30 when shipping was factored in!  The only reason I gave this product 2 stars is that it works as described solely for water, skin oils, and survival of cryogenic temperatures. The ink itself also seems a bit darker, and better quality than the Sharpie® pens I’ve been using.  But the writing from these pens did not “resist” any of the solvents I tried in any way, and the purported solvent resistance is literally the only reason I went with these guys.  I’m not sure what the fellow reviewer who claimed “almost nothing will take it off” tried, but it most definitely didn’t hold up to my tests, which is unfortunate.  I had high-hopes for this product.",0,0
R2QNRSLWE567YO,"Two days ago, I received this 901 black economy cartridge, because it was a few dollars cheaper than the standard cartridge and I don't usually print all that much at one time. Today, I ran out of ink. I did have a large file I tried to print (key word: try), and a couple of smaller print jobs, probably around 160 pages total, but didn't expect the ink to run out THAT quickly. That's a ridiculous cost per page of about $.09, plus paper. For what I got out of it, the print quality was good (hence the 2 stars), but I'll go back to the standard cartridge, which gives me a far longer life and far more pages, for only a few dollars more. And I'll be able to print the entire project (I ended up missing 15 pages because this cartridge has a life span of a gnat -- or maybe less!). Very disappointed in this purchase.",0,0

RYG1PK616ZHTQ,"Although I have to admit that this printer performed nicely, there is a MAJOR MAJOR problem with it.  Epson programmed an internal counter and once you reach what THEY have previously decided is the maximum copies it can make, you have to throw it away.  I've had one of these for just over a year, and I used it a lot.  It was still making wonderful looking copies but because their automatic internal counter says ""the ink pads are at the end of their service life"" it shuts itself down and will not make more copies. You have to throw it away.  The Epson site provides you with some access codes to extend the life a few more copies (which I did) but now even that won't work any more and I had to throw it away--a 1 year old printer. Insane. If you look at other reviewers, you will see the run-around Epson gave callers complaining about this problem and they still did nothing about it.  If you plan to own and use this printer for as long as YOU want, I suggest you do NOT buy it because EPSON decides how long you will own it, NOT YOU.  DO NOT BUY!",0,0
R3P72IWU1QGXTH,I would give this a lower star. Do NOT order these. I got them because my 2 year old likes closing the door and I’m afraid she would smash her fingers. I didn’t want to get the hooks you have to put at the bottom and drill screws into the soildwood doors to install these hold hooks. So when I came across these I thought PERFECT this is a temporary thing for my daughter she will soon understand that doors are not to play with and with these I wouldn’t have to drill any screws. WRONG!!! She closed the door it did do it’s job I give it that it kept the door open but she tried to close it again and BOOM I heard a crack. I thought oh it’s plastic it broke. Nope wrong again the force of not being able to close has pooped the screws out from the door hinges!!! MY door is now loose and squeaks VERY loud. I can’t believe this. Do not get these. They will mess up your doors. Trust me. I am a Interior Designer and I should have know better. My husband had to remove the door fix the existing holes and rehang and level the bedroom door. Thank goodness he’s could do it. If he couldn’t I’d have to pay someone to come and fix it. So do not buy this!!!!! I can’t stress it enough.,0,0

R28T4UKQU97DOP,"I purchased this safe after a moderate amount of research and thought all was well until last week. I started using it and discovered they keys I received didn't work (wrong cut completely). I had a locksmith come out and open the safe so I could retrieve something I had inside it (see below). I could have easily used a hammer or crowbar to get it open but it would obviously ruin the safe.Here's what I can say at this point:1) It's a sturdy safe by a well-known brand but the locking function should be considered a deterrent, not something that will prevent access.2) Check to see if the correct keys were sent. I read many reviews and several complained of the key breaking off inside the lock. I would probablt would also have broken them but decided to call a pro. The locksmith confirmed the keys I received were the wrong ones.3) I like the safe itself--it is heavy and more than adequate for what I need it for.4) Finally (seems kind of obvious now...) before putting something in the safe, make sure the keys you received work!It is after the warranty period, so I spent $100 to get the safe opened without ruining it and to have new keys made that actually work.

R1RW25E03ZS0CL,"My 8th grader son is taking Geometry this year. He needed a protractor/compass set for the class. This appeared to have good reviews  and my son loved all the options it came with. Had I of written a review before he actually used the items, I probably would have given them 4.5-5 stars considering all he got for such a reasonable price. However, he has attempted to use the compass’ a week now, and they are all worthless.. they all have the issue of not locking into position, so when you go to measure an angle and then move the compass to duplicate the angle, it’s not in the same position. This has caused major frustration. Also, on 2 of the compass’, the point where the 2 legs connect is very weak, it moves about oddly, if you open the legs you can see the broken plastic piece that is supposed to make it open evenly. This is with minimal use and me in the same room as my 8th grader (no siblings) so I know they haven’t been abused. The plastic protractor is ok. It did fall in my wooden floor and the center pivoting bar broke off, but my son was able to snap that into place, so we were happy about that. I gave it 2 stars because the protractors are still good, as well as the 6” ruler, but the main reason for buying this set was for the compass’ and they, unfortunately, proved to be worthless to us.

RGSULEXK1OHRB,"Ok. I don't really care about using certified toners only because of, as the printer manufacturers argue, the possible shortening of the life of the printer. Regardless of the truth of that argument, it is a fact that printers are cheap and certified toners are expensive. So why not just buy another printer I saved on using cheaper toners.That's why I gave it a go with this toner by PDS.But it didn't work.This might happened just to this one toner, and just me, as the general review score of this product is quite high.Regardless, what happened to me was that after using the new toner for about a week, I began to see some smudges on the printed papers, so I pulled the toner out and found out that it's been leaking.If the problem was just a somewhat 'cheap' looking, it would've been ok.But, this thing just didn't do the very basic job it's supposed to do -- to make where it has to be black black and white white.So now I'm going back to Brother's and going to stick to them.",0,0

R1T2PU3XH8OZU,"I was an early adopter of Neatreceipts when it was first introduced.  I was very excited about this product and it seemed to fill a niche we really had a need for. We spent a lot of time scanning in receipts.  Mostly, everything worked okay.  But eventually the cracks began to show and we started to look for a new solution.The first versions let you use a 3rd party scanner.  We have super-fast and sharp Fujitsu scanners at work.  They literally left the neatreceipts scanner in the dust.  Then with version 3, Neatreceipts disabled support for anything but their own scanner on the PC version, but mysteriously left it in the Mac version.  It was much slower and less accurate than the Fujitsu we had.  And as another reviewer mentioned earlier they abandoned the original format and promised a conversion utility to the new one.  With that confidence, many of us started using the new version and waited for the conversion utility to convert our old data. After several months they quietly said the utility was no longer in the works.Neatreceipts data is kept in a proprietary database.  It's not compatible, import-able, or readable by anything else... including earlier (and in some cases later) versions of the their own software.  We had one problem with a corrupted database, and after a phone call to tech support they said our data was toast from a bug they were working on, but so far had no fix for.  We did have a backup but lost the days' worth of receipts.This was sort of the final straw for us.  We concluded that important accounting info like receipts MUST be in a more universal format like PDF, or preferably PDF/a.  Also, the database needs to be something more universal like excel or a spreadsheet, where you can use the robust math functions of those programs to sort, search and sift through your data.  Neatreceipt's database engine seems bloated with lots of code for what it does.We finally said goodbye to NR after many years.  Our solution now is Filecenter - which scans and indexes quicker than NR, and stores all data in native Windows directories with the PDF/a format.  It's a much faster program than NR and slugs through many receipts and documents in minutes... especially with a fast scanner.  If you uninstall Filecenter, your data is safe and still all sorted in the directories.  It's a lean, mean program that gets the job done.I still miss NR - I loved they way it auto-populated some data from receipts.  But you still had to watch it as it was not completely accurate.  And even version 5 with the Neatdesk scanner is just too slow for business use for us.  Not only the scanning, but their sql database software seems bloated and chokes when you ask too much of it.  Even a super-fast computer doesn't seem to increase the speed of NR.  Not sure why?  I think the creators of NR were visionaries... I just wish they had evolved the product more.  Version 1.5 was the best.  Each new version was worse - and you can't downgrade after converting your data.  This seemed to be the general consensus on the support forums on their website.  (Neat recently deleted all of these user forums).",0,0

R2P88IPHQBSV79,"This is the 2nd BRAND compatible Toner I have purchased & received in this Month of August 2022.  I returned the other brand a week ago because the print quality was only FAIR and NOT Good compared to the existing toner cartridge that I was replacing it with.  The older toner cartridge was a compatible I purchased from Amazon in Sept of 2020 and it was still much crisper, darker and clearer than both the other  brand and this V4INK brand that I am writing about.  It seems to me that both recently received remanufactured toner cartridges (both are 2-pack) are being refilled with less quality toner material or maybe it's just LESS TONER in the cartridges.  Because of ""frustration"" I have decided to keep the V4INK cartridges rather than returning them as I did the other brand recently, just to try it out longer time to see if the print quality improves.  Amazon does stand behind these products, and I appreciate the quick response of a refund for the other brand this past week, but I am very disappointed to have the same thing happen with this 2nd choice compatible toner cartridge.  I hope this review helps Amazon to light the fire under the butts of the producers of these latest toner cartridges to possibly improve the quality of their products.",0,0

The steel tubing can be bent in half with your bare hands if you're any kind of a man. The foot pad is not real rubber, just a 2"" hard plastic piece that slips on wooden or tile floor and anyways, is way to small to actually get any kind of a grip on a floor even IF it were real rubber. Doesn't grip on carpet either. What you wind up with is a piece of thin-wall steel tubing that you may use to whack a burglar with when he crashes through your door, but you won't hurt him, you will just make him mad.

R1KJ059E0VSB50,"We ordered a Model 1103, as described above, because it claims to hold letter-sized paper flat. Honeywell, right? Reputable company, isn't it? The safe had over 1300 reviews, with a 4.5 overall rating! Wow! We just got it delivered today. Here are my immediate impressions. I strongly recommend reading them all before hitting that order button.The Good: This thing is built like a tank, and is remarkably heavy, but the outside and inside linings are almost entirely made of plastic. This is somehow not reassuring for fire resistance, but they claim it is. Should you trust them? Your decision. The latches seem very secure, and the lock would not be easily pried open.The bad: Here is the first head-scratcher:  When we put our will in, it bent slightly at the edges. (See photo for visual evidence.) I measured it, and the interior depth is 8 3/8 inches, a good 1/8 in. narrower than standard paper. Any idiot would say it should be probably 1/8 in. wider than the paper, so it's 1/4 in. too narrow.Why, I ask myself, would anyone deliberately build a tank that isn't quite big enough to correctly hold what it was designed to hold? I can't come up with any logical reason whatsoever. It seems like a small thing. Sure, you can put the papers in with a slight bend, but that reduces the effective capacity, as well as forcing your valuable papers to assume a permanent bend.I went back and looked at the description on the Amazon page. It gives two different external dimensions: At the top (notice these are direct quotes): ""Item Dimensions LxWxH 12.4 x 15.9 x 6.5 inches""In the About This Item section: ""The exterior Dimensions are 6.6 in H x 16.0 in w x 12.6 in D""OK, they're close, but this doesn't bode well for the veracity of anything else on the page, does it?More deviously, the only internal dimensions EVER mentioned anywhere on the page are way at the bottom, in the ""From the Manufacturer"" section (again, direct quote from the page): ""Interior Dimensions: 3.8""H x 14.8""W x 12""D "" Cool, 12 inches is far wider than standard paper, right?  Who would have noticed that this is for the 1104 model, not the 1103 that is being sold to us?THEN, I looked at reviews mentioning ""paper lies flat"", and found a stack of other Amazon reviews stating exactly the same thing, that the papers don't lie flat as claimed. Dumb me, I just trusted the star reviews on this one. I usually look at the comments. Never again will I not look at the comments.THEN, I read in the manual for our product that you have to open the safe for 30 minutes EVERY WEEK to let it air out, and they don't guarantee against interior moisture! I looked on the Amazon page again, and found more reviews about papers mildewing in the safe. Again, my bad for not reading this sooner. What the hell? How many people are going to put on their calendar every week to air out their document safe? Really?So, this really isn't a safe safe, after all, is it? You're trusting your most valuable, one of a kind documents to a box that can't even keep out moisture?What the hell, Honeywell?  You are lying through your teeth, selling us an undersized and poorly designed product. Since it is the Honeywell store selling it, the company clearly was aware.So, don't say you weren't warned.

R2JRA4A5DSL6DK,"When HP Printers work, they work really good. Quality-wise, they really are good with the printer output. It also just means the carts are pumping out a lot of ink fast! I am writing this review as a form of protest and fair warning to fellow consumers who have experienced or yet to experience the horrors and enraging frustration of having to fix and tweak faulty printers even for a mere one page printout task. I have had an HP8600 for some years and even bought a second one when the first one started going crazy on me. I can absolutely confirm that this was caused by the underhanded tactics of HP to release force-fed firmwares over the Internet (HP Printers are always connected now via router if you're on the net) that have led printers to disregard printer carts (whatever the source may have been, hand me downs, 3rd party carts, refills, donated carts, basically all carts outside of the retail carts supplied by HP, that contain the INK ALL USERS OF PRINTERS NEED. What else could printers be for but for printing? Actually, when the printer goes haywire due to the ""non malicious"" firmware upgrade (actually it's a profiteering racket that HP employed), you also lose the ability to scan documents!) I feel so violated that I can't even do what I want with the printer I bought with my own money! I didn't ask for that dumb firmware upgrade! Another sneaky way that an HP firmware upgrade does is it brightens out your control panel, so it's basically overbrightened and you can barely read anything on the digital keyboard panel, not unless you've mastered the keypad/letter placements. I have gone through 5 carts already and I've just wasted money on carts I can't use. My 2nd printer sort of exhibited a few symptoms and it's probably because I cross contaminated it with the carts that were exposed to the 1st printer's printhead. The ink carts' chips are basically embedded with data, obviously designed to ruin every HP printer owner's day because that's what HP seemingly wants, us to spend money on new printers and their ink!",0,0

R3H0YW1Q995HO0,"So I bought this pen because I draw a lot. I heard it has a super fine tip and does not smudge. It dries immediately and a highlighter could be used in seconds. And I found this to be true (and loved it!) However, the reason why I gave it a 2 star was because of its ink flow and the way the nib was made. I felt like the nib was scratching the surface of my paper (leaving little pen scratch marks) It wasn't as smooth and I could hear/feel the pen scraping the paper as I write and draw. Now I’m not sure if this was a defect on my order, but the two pens I got were definitely not good. In addition, the pen would clog up, and no ink would run through it as I write (this got really annoying). And once I cleaned the nib, the ink would continuously bleed (“explode”) and eventually clog up again (it was a never ending cycle).Overall, if this pen were to work properly (ex. Consisted ink flow and smoother nib) then I would rate this pen a 5star. But as of right now and the way it acts up for me. I do NOT recommend these pens to artists/heavy note takers that want to draw/write without ink flow issues and pen scratch marks.",0,0

R22W080VIHPZOH,"Because these cartridges were so cheap, I decided to order two.  It's a good thing I did, too.  When I replaced my existing cartridge, my printer's toner light remained on.  I thought that I had possibly installed the cartridge wrong, but after about 20 minutes of fooling with it I decided to try the second cartridge.  Presto!  It worked just fine.  I will be returning the defective cartridge for a refund.  With that said, I will probably order this product again, hoping this was just a fluke.  I'll update this review when I do.  If all goes well on my next order, I'll rate this product higher, but only 2 stars for now.",0,0

I've only gotten it to print a few times in the years that I've had it and that's only after sitting around for a long time trying to figure out what its problem is.

R1KGJC06JWXIOQ,"This certainly seems like it might be a great cart, but I had no opportunity to find out because of the way it was packed. After opening Amazons absurdly large and poorly taped box, fighting through layers of torn cardboard and paper, I was confronted by the largest amount of tape I've ever sen. This tape, clear and sticky, was difficult to remove, and the little that I diod get off the product left a thick, sticky residue behind. It would've taken a few hours to clean the cart, since the tape was on every surface. (see photos) What a thoughtless way to ruin a perfectly serviceable product. And yes, it does stink too. Needless to say, I returned it. I'm not sure who has enough time and will to dedicate a whole day to cleaning of a new product, but I sure think that it ought to arrive clean.  Also, I've never seen a worse packing job from Amazon. I had to use an entire roll of packing tape to get the package back into some approximation of a box to send this thing back. I can only guess that this item used to be delivered in a more reasonable condition, given the many favorable reviews, but as of May 2011, you get an unholy, stinking mess for your money.

R1EU8A3SQVEI5P,"These used to be very nice pads. Crisp lines, large header, sturdy, perfectly clean tears. Apparently at some point over the last few years, they decided to throw quality out the door in favor of cost. This newer one has blurry printing, a tiny header that's nearly useless for most people's handwriting, and I'm afraid of tearing the page every time I go to remove one. For being 8 cents per sheet, I'd expect the quality these USED to boast... will likely not be buying another.Possibly the only praise I can give this new one is that the graph lines on the back are relatively clean.

R1UZHG0TZGZ2XP,"Avoid; try Shoeboxed ([...]) with a scanner of your choice (I prefer flatbed). The sql database can be corrupted and rendered unusable by software or hardware crashes. Neat's solution for that is to provide a backup utility. Unfortunately, this backup of all data can take hours, and results in one very large file. As one other reviewer noted, such an extended procedure makes no sense for the home user that is just trying to add a few receipts and turn the computer off at night. Long and slow operations like this greatly increase the odds that the program will be interrupted by a crash. As another reviewer noted, its slowness makes it a bad choice for the business user as well. I didn't back up for a while; in my case, windows got corrupted and would not boot (don't know if the database was damaged). The partition can be read; all my wordprocessing, spreadsheet and pdf files can be opened; as far as this program goes, nothing. These problems seem inherent to sql; Neat may have chosen it to keep users dependent on them for data access. It would be a lot easier, faster, safer, and more appropriate for its intended non-server use to store pdf scans in folders and access them with a simple indexing program. Finally, my scanner went bad in about a year; it developed the streaks that some others have reported.",0,0

RCP531HIQNRHN,"BTW - Assuming you own Neat 5.0 software, you cannot purchase a scanner without a second purchase of the software!  Greta sales idea!UPDATE IS AT THE END OF THIS REVIEW as of 6-JAN-12I've spent over 8 hours running uninstalls/re-installs and registry cleans and under direction of two technical support representatives gone into file folder permissions and changed permissions and ownership - all installation issues that the reps acknowledge are failures in their installation script for Windows/7.  To put it bluntly, on a vanilla Windows/7 notebook, they are unable to have the product install without it crashing either instantly or after a few minutes of use.Great Idea - Terrible implementationIf you have Windows/7 - DON'T EVEN CONSIDER THIS PRODUCTNEAT is in violation of IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY -Why? IT DON'T WORK!Received NeatReceipts yesterday NeatReceipts Mobile Scanner and Digital Filing System Went to do install today, found that the installation CD was out of date (!) so downloaded the most currect version 5 software from Neat.com and installed without error.This is a Win/7 configuration Dell M1530Installed Neat handheld scannerStarted using the product - entered a few receipts to learn the filing and categorizing parameters.Walked away for a moment and on return found a popup error message:""Neat has stopped working"" and ""Windows is closing Neat because it has stopped working""Tried to reload and re-execute it - it loads momentarily into the task list and then abends/crashes almost immediately - same error messages.Did a complete re-install.Used for about 2 hours - loaded a number of receipts in to Neat - trashed the receipts - WRONG MOVE!Why?  went for dinner - came back to find Neat had abended/crashed again - back in same situation - no access to data entered - and the images cannot be accessed without Neat - non-standard storage method.Sent support inquiry to Neat.Got back a truly nonsensical response""Based on what you've asked, the following answers might be relevant.The following answers might help you immediately.Title: Connecting Your QuickBooks Company File to Neat 5Link: [...]Hmmm - I have never had Quickbooks.  Don't have Quickbooks,  Never said I hasd Quickbooks.It was never mentioned in the installation process.Never said anything about Quickbooks in the support inquiry.RESPONSE TO RON in the Neat Forum:Ron, and any one else reading,Yes, after several days including much time on the telephone, at least for my configuration, which is Windows/7 3gb memory, the problem was the install script being deficient in how it set file/folder permission.Before I go on, you may ask as you read the next sentence, why in heck does Neat 5.0SP2 required total administrative control of your machine, but I'll let you try to get the answer. The ""solution"" is go in to the folder properties for Neat located as follows:\Program Files\Common Files\NeatReceipts\Program Files\Neat\Program Data\The Neat Companyand the desktop shortcut for Neatand modify the properties of all folders and subfolders within, or the properties of the shortcut for security so that YOUR OWN SPECIFIC LOGON on this machine [as opposed to already Administrators, etc] has FULL CONTROL.The result then is the program works SO LONG AS YOUR MACHINE DOES NOT GO IN TO POWER STANDBY or SLEEP or worse! So you now have a working program as long as you remember to either keep the machine from going in to an idle state or you shut the program if you know you are going to walk away for a bitNow today I spent time on the phone with a nice young man in Philadelphia who explained to me that they had never heard of this problem before so there was no way for them to debug it. As for the obvious questions of why does the program so violate windows security and why is the install script not correct, your guess is as good as mine. So if you want to tell the nice young man that you too have experienced this supposed one-off error, use TICKET [Incident: 120101-000139].Best to all and to you Ron, good luck",0,0

R1M8NPD4SX1QJI,"Final Update: A lifetime of just 2 years.  Wow.I was somewhat impressed with Neat at first.  This little scanner filled a basic need, with several glitches and the occasional total software crash.  No big deal.  I suggested some improvements, but the software was never fixed.  Now, after owning one for just 2 years, Neat has shown why they had no interest in fixing or improving their product...The scanner software started crashing at startup.  It had done this on occasion, so I thought ""no big deal.""  When I went online to get support, I received a message that Neat no longer ""supports"" its devices and software; they just sell a monthly service.Neat got tired of working with ordinary 500% profit margins on $150 portable scanners, and decided they would also require a monthly fee.  This is where the real money is.  Sony and other companies have been coming around to the same truth.  I think they all learned it from the cell phone companies.  If you just bill a relatively small amount to a few million credit cards ($5-$50 per account, per month), you can make a fortune in return for absolutely nothing, and no one will protest because it seems like such a small amount each month.I guess some people like having all their finances and other personal information out there in the ""cloud,"" but I don't.  Besides, if you just want an online backup of your data, there are several free, secure alternatives.  I was already running Neatware with as little online interaction as possible, but I would never pay these crooks to mine my financial records!So, what I thought would be a lifetime (or at least long-term) $100 receipt scanner lasted about 2 years.  I will never buy another Neat product for as long as I live!1-Year Update: Had to drop it to 4 stars, because it is great, but it could be improved in many ways.Now, the hardware is very simple.  It's an open scanning cylinder in which the paper feeds straight through.  Because many (most?) receipts come from a ""roll"" of paper, and are sometimes folded or crinkled, they very often tend to exit the scanner and then loop back around to the feeder--causing a looping scan or a jam.  Barring that, receipts are often difficult to load.  This front-loading scanner is supposed to have a grab/preload function, but it only works about half the time.Most problems, however, are with the software.  First off, the OCR software is not great.  Receipts are often askew or printed poorly, and this accounts for some (but not all) of the problem.  There may only be one field that is incorrect on any given receipt (e.g. vendor, date, tax, total), but I am quite surprised on the unusual occasion that every field on a receipt is correct and the receipt is immediately ready to file.  Then, when you type in the correct info and go to another field, the corrections are not saved until you open another receipt or folder.  Problem is, I often correct the data and immediately drag the receipt into a folder--losing the corrections.  To keep from losing corrections, I have to click on another receipt, wait for it to load, then click back on the corrected receipt, then drag it to a folder.  This is a tedious waste of time.On the other hand, Neat is the only company that has these simple fields--which are just what I need.  This is still much easier than creating *and* filling appropriate fields in any other program.Second, and this may or may not be a problem for most folks, but we have several credit cards in our large family. Every time I scan a receipt, Neat seems to want to categorize the payment method as simply MC, Visa, Credit, or Debit.  I have created separate labels for, e.g., Visa ####, but Neat seems unable to learn this system--even though the numbers are printed on every receipt.Third, I started hitting a lot of bugs in the software after almost a year of use.  I looked up some tips on the web, and they worked for awhile, but Neat then started crashing every time I loaded it.  I eventually contacted customer support, who requested a log, and who gave me a 100% permanent fix.Since most shortfalls are in the software, it seems Neat could improve them if it really wanted to.  Problem is, with a hardware-based payment system, there is little to no motivation to improve the software.  I think all Neat really needs is some good old-fashioned competition.  There are plenty of great scanners out there, and there is some software that *can* manage receipts (e.g. Evernote), but no one else is really shooting specifically for the receipt-scanner market.  There are some companies now focusing on the smartphone-receipt-photo market, but I prefer the clean system of an actual scanner for my tax returns.Original Review: So I ordered the Fujitsu ScanSnap because of its great reviews.  It was a great little scanner, with a great range of functionality.  Only problem is, I needed a scanner for one very specific task--receipts.I have an awe-inspiring Brother scanner/copier/laser printer.  The resolution suits my needs, but what I really needed (badly) was a simple, reliable, and accurate hardware-software package for receipts.  It's so simple that it may seem corny, but Neat really does the job.I have a large family, and I've been wanting to scan all my receipts so I could claim our actual sales taxes.  Every time I want to scan a receipt, I just open the software, load the receipt, and hit scan.  The OCR is very good, and it has a certain amount of learning so it can recognize the vendor and format (tax, etc.).The scanner could be improved.  For one thing, the software shows up in Windows 8 and anti-virus programs as like 30 different programs and registry entries.  No big deal, it's just sloppy.  More importantly, if the computer has hibernated since you last used Neat, you will have to unplug and replug the scanner to get it to work.  I do it at the scanner, and I now know to do it while the software is loading.  So again, no big deal.  I also have not yet had to deal with a major software update and the reported losses of data, backward compatibility, or other problems.  But 6 months into the year and several hundred receipts into it, everything is peachy!",0,0

RVPHVBIF9MRYF,"This is the first product review I have ever written but I feel the Neat system is such a bad product and people need to be warned about it.  I purchased the Neat scanner in June 2013 as a simple solution to keep receipts.  I am not new to scanning -- I have owned an Epson commercial scanning system for several years.  While Epson is good for large documents, small receipts are cumbersome.  So the Neat system seemed to be a good solution.The Neat software began to have trouble sometime around 4 or 5 months of use.  Technical support is nearly non-existent and the technical support staff is not very knowledgeable.  At the end of 2013, or after 6 months worth of scanned receipts, I decided that the prudent thing to do would be to archive the data  and start 2014 fresh.  I followed the Neat instructions to archive the data and the software produced a nice archive file.  Problem solved, so I thought.  Last week, I tried to go into the archive to retrieve a receipt and guess what only about 20 receipts had been archived -- there should have been probably 200 or 300 or so.  OK, I thought I'll get the receipts from the Neat cloud back-up.  And guess what the receipts weren't there either.  After several online chats with Neat technical support (live agents are apparently not available for phone conversations), the online agent concluded that the system had malfunctioned and my data had been lost.  There had been no warnings or anything -- just lost data.  Let's hope I never get audited.I should add I am quite adept and capable in terms of computer and networking literacy and experience and I own new, high quality computers with up-to-date software which are the core of my small accounting business.  Fortunately my client data has been collected using the Epson system and that system has never malfunctioned in roughly 5 years.  I should have never trusted the Neat system.  Bottom line -- poor software, poor technical support -- do not purchase unless you want to lose your data.  Mine is going into the garbage dumpster.",0,0

Still full of ink but won't work. Stay away. Waste of money. Should have trusted my instincts.****Nervous about aftermarket ink but this product is fantastic. I ordered two sets of black/color XL cartridges. I reviewed the you should use genuine HP ink when I installed them, pressed OK and away I went. These print extremely well.

R2HEMI28L34JJ1,"Buyer beware...these are fakes.  The pen I received came without any packaging...no Lamy box, no product warrantee (all Lamy fountain pens come with a warrantee, at least the real ones do).  Additionally, the grip section does not align flush with the pen body when assembled.  I'll give it to whoever manufactures these fakes...if the lack of packaging/warrantee didn't tip you off, then at first glance they appear legit, especially so if you're unfamiliar with them and don't know what to look for.  But I own two other Lamy fountain pens, and if this is an authentic Lamy Al-Star, then I'm the Queen of England.  If you don't care about getting an authentic, warrantee-covered product that will function properly with other Lamy nibs, and all you care about is saving a few bucks off the going retail price, then by all means, buy this fake Lamy.  I hope it works out for you.  As for me, I've learned my lesson: only buy from an authorized Lamy retailer.  I've initiated the refund process and will be returning this fake in the mail tomorrow.",0,0

R1LCEJD828MCZ1,"It's a wonderful concept but falls short in actual use. I have used this little desk with a 15"" laptop and a small mouse, always while sitting upright in bed with the stand over my legs. First, the pad area for use with a mouse is nice, plenty of room for even a full size mouse. I don't tilt my laptop more than about one notch but that too is handy -- there are several positions for you to tilt your laptop, iPad or book. I never had a problem with the laptop sliding over the edge but mine was never terribly upright. The teeny light is virtually useless -- not enough illumination to be able to see your keyboard. The little storage area is odd -- why did they design it to open from the front side of the table instead of the back? Not convenient at all if you are storing Post-its, flash drives, pens, etc. and want to retrieve something. The desk is very uncomfortable to use if you fold the legs under and use it as just a tray -- there's no padding or anything of the sort so you would need a blanket or pillow. We're talking hard plastic here, which makes the device fairly light in weight but you don't want it digging into your legs.Now, let's get to those lap-desk legs. This is what caused me to give it only two stars. They're okay in the shorter position while you're using it in bed, on a couch, chair, that kind of function. When the legs are extended out all the way they're very unstable and lack any kind of locking mechanism. So what, you might say. I always store my laptop on this desk with the legs fully extended and it stays on the floor between uses. I can't tell you how often I've moved or picked it up to vacuum, shove it aside or just pick it up to use it -- and one or both of the legs folded inward and my laptop slid off the side. Gaaa! For the past year I've been thinking I was doing something wrong, it must be that I'm not smart enough to figure out how to lock the legs in place. No, now that I've decided to give this thing away I can see it's a design flaw and I should have smacked myself in the head after the first collapse of the legs, watching my expensive new laptop slide off. Ah well, live and learn.There are many more choices of lap desks out there, I wouldn't bother with this one. Save your money and find one that's rated higher and constructed better.",0,0

I figured I'd put the old bulb back in and run that (the old one was still functional, just getting on in hours) and the problem persists.

R13ZEPOXZINCYV,"I've been using Neat Receipts for a while now and have found it to be a decent product. A nice side benefit of their portable scanner was that I could use it without the software for other scanning tasks.I recently bought another laptop running Win 7 and did a search to find the driver for it. Imagine my chagrin when I couldn't find one. However, chagrin turned to outright anger once I discovered that the reason I couldn't find a new driver is that Neat Co. is charging another $30 for the ""privilege"" of getting a Win 7 compliant driver that will allow me to continue using their scanner with Neat software....or anything else.So if you're planning on buying this or any other Neat product, make sure you budget for the cost of buying new drivers whenever Neat Co. needs a boost to their bottom line. Sure there's nothing that requires a company to provide a new driver....well, other than a sense of decency, a lack of outright corporate greed, and perhaps a class action lawsuit.By the time one of their reps shows up with a slick response to this review, I'll already have a new scanner and will have started the process of archiving and/or re-scanning all my data as I refuse to give my money to a company that operates this way.Buh Bye Neat Co.",0,0

R2BUGJ51FR4M1Z,"Bought these for my Cannon PIXMA MX922. I had put the first cartridge in a few weeks ago without inspecting it closely, which was my fault, as this is a new vendor for me. The printer stopped working today with the infamous B200 error code (and ink cradle error that stops your printer dead in it's tracks) I pulled out the cartridge first off and sure enough the cradle was full of ink. I had to clean copious amounts of ink out, and then started opening a new one to insert. Each new cartridge was leaking ink all over. None were useable. I ended up going to Walmart and paying $24 for ONE Cannon ink cartridge to get my printer going again until I can get new ones from a different vendor on Amazon.** All this being said, this vendor did give me a full refund, no questions asked upon request in the return form and I did not have to return the ink cartridges, so the vendor is an honest, reputable vendor.

R17FUN23M5D05T,"I give this calculator two stars because it has a lot of functionality.  It is mostly a time sink and a source of frustration.Pros:1. This is a capable machine.  It can do a lot.  Much more than I ever want a calculator to do, actually.2. Hi-res screen.  The high resolution is nice.Cons:1.  The keyboard is terrible.  The keyboard on TI's earlier calculators were bad, and this one is actually worse.  TI needs to take a lesson from HP on how to make keys that don't wobble around and that provide some decent tactile feedback.  The keys, all of them, are squishy and wobbly.  The extra crowding by the letter keys makes it incredibly difficult to type anything, numbers or letters, without hitting the wrong key.  It is a constant source of frustration as well as a waste of time.2.  The learning curve it too high.  If I use this in class, I will need to take considerable time (a few days) just teaching the students how to use it.  This is time that then cannot be spent teaching math and physics.  Which should I teach my students, Newton's Laws of Motion, or how to click ""Menu...Action...Pointer...""3.  Doing simple tasks is now difficult.  Turn it on, wait for the operating system to load, then click Home, then 1:calculator, then Enter, and then you can finally type 2+2 and get an answer.4.  The screen, while it is hi-res, is not all that easy to read.  It gets a good bit of glare.5.  My students don't like it.  With the TI-83, I would at least get a lot of ""Oh, that's cool"" comments when a nice graph would appear.  When one of my poor students finally accomplishes a task on the nSpire, there is instead a sense of relief that they finally got it do what they were trying to do.  This calculator is not enjoyable to use.6.  The calculator is bulky.  Even the TI-83 was pretty large for carrying around, and this one is even larger.I'm sticking with the TI-83 for now, and considering switching to HP.If you want to do any real work in physics or engineering, go with HP.  They are still the gold standard of calculators.",0,0

RQGQ230R5G5FO,"These replacement cartridges were ordered for a HP Deskjet 3050 which is being used to print a low volume newsletter. Initially, the print quality was good, however the tricolor cartridge produced multiple errors, which caused the printing to malfunction. About 9 pages into the print job, errors in the printing began to appear, and each time, a tricolor cartridge error was displayed on the printer. I replaced the tricolor with the old, nearly empty tricolor cartridge and the problem resolved, until the color ink was depleted. I have returned the set to the seller in exchange for another set. I will revise this review once the replacements are received and tested. Follow up: I received replacement cartridges the next day and the print quality was good. No errors.

R18QA48V0Q312U,"I've owned the Charles Leonard pencil sharpener (model #89508)for six months. After reading many reviews and searching the web for an economical and functional rotary pencil sharpener I took the plunge and bought this sharpener. And then wanted to return it.First flaw, the mounting screws are useless. I knew this going into the purchase and thought a trip to the hardware store would make for an easy fix. Now I ask, why should I do the work that is the MANUFACTURER's responsibility?? It's still not mounted. I've many other things I need to do and doing somebody else's job isn't among them.Second flaw, because it is unmounted (still) one person has to hold the sharpener firmly down so another person can sharpen the pencil. Typically somebody knocks off the cover...frequently...because it just does NOT stay on...and it ain't goin' back on in a hurry! The cover just does NOT go back on in the up/down position (as shown in the picture). Mine has dents from forcing it back into position.If it were sideways mounted(HA!)then presto, no problemo, the cover easily goes on sideways. EVERY time a pencil is sharpened the cover comes off and pencil grindings are everywhere...again!!Third flaw, yes the sharpener has eight holes for differing sizes of pencils. One hole is helpfully marked STANDARD to show where standard-sized pencils ought to fit. I'm not sure which country the Standard is set but it isn't the U.S. since my average #2 U.S. school pencils don't fit in the standard slot.For that matter, my child's oversized pencil fits in the largest oversized hole but the burr doesn't touch the pencil. What's the point of offering eight sizes if the largest holes are just for appearance not function?Lastly, sometime recently it began only sharpening effectively in one direction. And not in the comfortable direction but the awkward one (remember it takes two people to run it). When the sharpener was new the burr mostly cut the pencils on all sides so maybe it was worth a little effort. Now it only shaves one side. The tip is long and sharp...and breaks often so that now I'm back where I began: looking on Amazon for a functioning rotary pencil sharpener.In the immortal words of my child: ""The thing's a ripoff"".",0,0

R3RUM3Y1RF353G,"Buyer beware!  This toner cartridge gives extremely poor yield and, therefore, is a poor value.I purchased this toner cartridge for a Brother DCP-7065DN printer.  The original Brother “starter” cartridge lasted for slightly more than 1000 pages, although the last 200 or so pages were after the “low toner” message had started.  The replacement cartridge worked fine for approximately 800 pages.  Then, the print quality suddenly deteriorated very badly.  There was no “low toner” warning message;  there was just the deterioration in print quality.  The print quality problem was exactly like that shown on page 63 of the printer’s “Basic User’s Guide.”  It was typical of the fading-out that occurs when a cartridge is running out of toner.  (This was clearly NOT a print-quality problem related to cleaning, e.g., it was NOT the type of problem in which specks or lines appear.)Unfortunately, I had bought another of these cartridges because the first one was initially giving good copies.  Because of the poor print quality, I ended up switching out to the second cartridge before I had reached 1000 copies on the first cartridge.  In other words, a cartridge that was supposed to give me 2600 copies lasted for fewer printed pages than the original Brother starter cartridge.  The second cartridge is currently giving good copies (just like the first one).  It remains to be seen how long this cartridge will last.UPDATE  on 08/19/15:  The second cartridge is now running out of toner and giving poor copies.  I got less than 1200 pages!  Both times there was no ""toner low"" warning, so now I have to act quickly to buy a new toner cartridge, but certainly never again from Shop at 247.

R1WHELNTG8ZMK1,"This should be a zero rating. It appears that poor quality control renders item useless as an adjustable stool.The best two things that can be said are: (1) that it works as a single height stool; (2) customer service answers emails promptly.The stool arrived in good condition. There are slightly different versions of the assembly instructions - one online and one with the kit.  This causes confusion.  A critical piece of information is missing from both: the orange cap  is not removed.  The illustration of which cap to remove is not to scale and appears to indicate the orange cap on the piston.In this case, the cylinder piston was inoperative. The company sent another without argument.  It arrived 7 or more days later  which defeats the purpose of having Amazon Prime for speedy delivery.Taking apart a forcefit assembly requires muscle, padding, and a non-marrying mallet.  You can add $25 to $45 dollars to the cost for a good mallet unless you think the company will accept a dented return.The second cylinder worked but only after another round of assembly and disassembly.  Sitting and bouncing on the chair did not activate the piston as per the optimistic instructions. A sound wack on the orange cap  with the mallet did.Still, the stool did not work. A final disassembly found that the weld for the seat adjusting lever was crooked.  It did not make contact with the piston.  No easy fix.Customer service has not been contacted about the second quality control failure.  If they read this and want to send another seat assembly I'll edit the rating.  It's not worth the time, effort, or expense to go through another round of emails or to box up the unit and send it back.Seriously considering giving the stool a Viking funeral then have an artist friend render the remains with company logo and address into an art piece for the local gallery.",0,0

The case itself does not shut -- the lid is too wide for the base and the ""locking"" parts do not even touch. The ruler, protractor, and triangles are very cheap plastic. The compasses looked like a sturdy metal, but they seem cheap as well. NOT worth the money I paid and I WILL be returning this for a refund.Might be okay for young students, but not for true art supplies!",0,0

At least twice a year I am fighting with the refills to get them installed correctly.  Too many yards of the refill are wasted on wrinkles and crinkles, as the two sides refuse to line up properly for the machine to evenly roll them together to laminate things.Why the manufacturer can't put out a product that is install and user friendly, I have no idea.  I have given this product more time than anyone should allow, and it has failed, miserably.  It has one star, mainly because Amazon requires at least one to be given.  Perhaps that one star will go for the fact that once the product is properly lined up (which you can plan on using the whole half of a day to get it right...), it protects papers and crafts very well.",0,0

RRYXVRN3WEY7Z,"I should have listened to the reviews and steered clear of these but of course I had to learn everything else in life the hard way so it’s only fitting that be the case with these as well.To begin with, I opened the case to find pens with all sorts of different amounts of ink levels which is always a red flag but was especially concerning and disappointing because some were nearly empty and I do mean empty. I have emptied enough gel pens to know that this isn’t something that happens easily or by accident. Maybe if the pen was nearly empty AND there was a bunch of ink leaked all in the cap and case but that’s not at all what went on with my set. The cap and the case were both clean. The different various ink levels along with the fact that when I emailed the seller and requested a replacement set and was instead given a refund and told that there were no more sets tells me that I almost certainly received a used set that had been returned after quite a bit of use.I assume the reason it was returned was not due to the levels of ink though. I imagine that the original owner received a pretty even batch and that the ink amount changed as they used the pens. The reason I imagine they probably returned these was because, quite frankly, they aren’t very good pens. I could be wrong because I got a used set and maybe the previous owner left the caps off or something but all of the pens were mostly dry and barely flowed. The ones that did flow would skip a lot and were frustratingly unreliable. To top it off the colors were not very vibrant or anything special. The ink did dry quickly, I will give it that. Also there is a good variety of textures as this set has neon, metallic, and glitter. Out of the entire set I really liked the color of four of them and of those four, two were dried up, one was empty and the other worked.These pens are so thin that I can’t imagine getting much use out of them for coloring anyway even if they did work. They barely contain much ink at all. I definitely really liked the feel of the skinnier pens in my hand though as I have pretty tiny hands though so that may be why. The difference in feel though does not outweigh the negatives however and I’d take a fatter pen between my fingers for longer lasting, reliable ink flow, cheaper price, and better color selection any day. The case was nice and hard and latched solidly and I thought that was a great change from the usual folding, cheap, annoying, plastic things that most gel pens come in but unfortunately the pens were super hard to get out of it and I felt like I was going to snap a pen in half trying to get it out or put it in.Bottom line: Do not buy these! Look elsewhere on Amazon because they have some amazing sets with 100 beautiful colors, comfort grips, perfect flow, and refills for almost half of what these cost. Check out Aen, ColorTechnik, Amazapens, and GelWriters right here on Amazon for some high quality and reliable gel pens!",0,0

But, sadly, within a month, the ink stopped coming out smoothly. I would scribble in circles, furiously hoping for just a few more lines of notes. But, it was to no avail. I miss those pens but honestly, I miss the money I spent on them instead of tacos. The 2 stars are because when I first got them, I loved the colors and they did write well and dry quickly.

R1YY68Z8GSFRIR,"I've used other labels from House Labels in the past, such as 8.5 x 5.5 shipping labels. Those shipping labels were the best ""off brand"" labels I ever used, and were nice and thick so that I could run them through the printer twice when needed. They also stuck perfectly to boxes.These Dymo labels were a disappointment though. Although they have a premium feel, they keep peeling off items that I stick them on. Maybe I received a bad batch. I don't have this peeling problems with the Dymo or Brother brand labels I've used in various label printers.Edit: In reponse to the comment noting that these are meant to be removeable labels- I did overlook that when I originally purchased them. That does make a difference. However, I'm leaving my review at 2 stars because I think they also fail as removeable labels. These are ""too removable"" and simply would not stay on the items. They kept peeling off after a few days, and lasted an even shorter time for items that were not perfectly flat. Amazon uses labels that are removeable yet actually stay on the item when you want them to, so I imagine that House Labels could improve these with a slight change in their adhesive formula.",0,0

RS5U3U361PH4H,"****3days later Edit****Oh man I hate to admit it but this thing really let us down. The cup holder netting and ring broke off literally an hour after I left the first review. I was able to fix it but now the little drawer it sits on won’t shut. The legs not being individually adjustable really turned out to be a bigger deal than I thought it would be. Here’s why: the pop up top is actually pretty heavy. And when you have it raised, it makes the whole thing want to fall toward you. Being able to adjust those legs to make them longer under that side, would balance that. But instead it just falls in your lap. Spilled the drink all over the place. Another thing is: when the top is raised for propping your device, the crease between the raised part and flat part pinches and scratches the crap out of you. Finally, the little pedestal won’t stay in either designated place, the little pegs are just too short.It’s a real bummer too because my kid really loves the tray. I noticed the problems on the second day but she begged me to keep it because she loves the anchor stamp and how beautiful the whole thing is. And I do too. But I’m afraid I’m going to have to return it. I even thought I would keep it and get her something different but it does the exact same thing to me. I’ll be contacting the seller ASAP because I’ve already thrown away the box.First, I want to say that this tray is BEAUTIFUL craftsmanship. I’m so impressed with it! It’s solid! Sturdy, smooth and absolutely perfect. I ordered it for my special needs daughter who needs it for her iPad. The only issue I have is her iPad case makes it a little too bulky to prop on the pedestal, which was my reason for getting the tray. That’s the cases fault, not the tray. But it would be an improvement to make that pedestal a little bigger to hold a bulky device. Also, as you can see in the photo, I had to put a pillow under the tray to stop it from falling forward on her. Adjusting the legs didn’t help prevent this. I think if you would make each leg individually adjustable, so that I could level it against her weight and pull on it, it would fit her needs better. And, if you do indeed decide to make that improvement, I will keep this one and buy her another one. Because we really love it!! But for now I’m going to use Velcro to help hold her iPad and I’ll continue using the pillow for her lap. Thank you for such a beautiful piece. My daughter especially loves the cup holder.",0,0

R3FFFD8FHVTCUL,"UPDATE **See revised review below** I have been hesitant for years to try third party printer cartridges, but after shelling out hundreds of dollars and realizing that I've spent 5 times as much on ink as I did my actual printer, I decided to give these a shot. I'm glad I did. They are identical in terms of output quality to their HP counterparts. Seriously, why throw away money? I use my printer daily for various things and I cannot tell the difference. It's a no-brainer for me, I'm done wasting money on HP's ridiculously overpriced cartridges.Update July 2017:It took a while for me to get what I paid for, but the day finally came. I guess it's true, If something seems to good to be true, it probably is. After months of use, these cartridges have failed spectacularly. While ink levels remain good, the quality of printing is disastrous. Streaking, bleeding, gobs of black ink on my documents, and now an error message on my printer, which might be permanently damaged from these cheap cartridges. I'm not even attempting to print photos, just standard documents with basic colors. They come out dark and hideous looking, and the black ink is also bleeding onto the paper on the sides.I hope these didn't destroy my printer, but it's back to genuine HP for me.

R1WQBHRCVPZJF1,"Things were off to a rocky start when I didn't know exactly how I was supposed to even start putting it together. It tells you to ""Attach both legs to the tray by inserting them into the holes from the outer side until it clicks"". ...What? I gave them the benefit of the doubt and went right to it, only to realize I started it wrong. I had a 50/50 shot lol. What they SHOULD say is for you to make sure that their logo is right side up, facing the direction of the top of the tray. Was that so hard to explain?Because I put it on incorrectly, I had to pull the legs back out, and this was REALLY HARD. It felt like I was going to break it. I couldn't proceed with how I had it, because inserted incorrectly, the screw holes weren't aligned properly. I read a previous review that mentioned they weren't predrilled...it sounds like this person didn't insert the legs correctly. They also mentioned that the degrees didn't match up...this is also likely why.My biggest gripe is how much of an absolute pain the legs are to adjust, which is its main feature. You really have to shove your thumb into the hard plastic button to get it to rotate. This is really awkward for me, especially because I'm currently going through physical therapy for my wrist. Whenever I think things are going kind of well with it, I get stuck trying to rotate it because the legs are misaligned, and want to just throw the whole thing in the trash.I purchased this because I figured it was more convenient to have something that is easy to fold up and put away, than to replace my entire desktop with a large standing desk. This is absolutely not that thing lol. I pretty much never want to adjust the legs because of how painful wrestling with them is. It's fine if you never have to adjust it.Not recommended.",0,0

Otherwise everything is worse, ALSO cheap looking. The pressure from my Muji pen shows up on the other side and the spiral holes are atrocious, with the top hole being cut so unevenly it’s actually just open.

However, the printer would give an error when you asked it to do a print head alignment, so it's not possible to do a print head alignment.  The cartridges are also super-leaky.  Wear latex gloves and watch out for your clothes.I think because of that, the print quality was poor, and had lines in it.  I still kept using the cartridges, though, until the Magenta cartridge died after about 50 pages.  I had a spare from the same company, but that one the printer wouldn't recognize at all, even after trying to reset the printer three times.  I gave up and put my old, depleted HP cartridges back in the printer, and although the printer complained that it was low on ink, it still was able to print for me, so I know my printer and the setup is working.I went ahead and check the rest of the second set, and about half of them are dead, at least on the first try.At this point, I give up on these cartridges.  They're super cheap, and I might get them to work eventually, but there are other inexpensive HP-compatible cartridges out there that work the first time, every time, and have great print quality.Also, since the manufacturer expects you to pay return shipping, if you do have to return these cartridges, you're out the shipping charges both ways, which is about the same as the whole pack of cartridges costs.  So you can't really even get your money back.",0,0

Not sure if this was just my batch but I don't think I'll be buying these again. The issues started with the ink flow -- these things skip constantly during writing, now don't get me wrong these pens are very precise, but the ink flow is incredibly poor, if you are not holding them at the right angle or forcing the ink down yourself, it constantly skips, which in my opinion makes these just not worth buying. I have not used the Japanese version of this pen, but I have heard they are much better, if you need this pen, buy the Japanese version instead, you will be better off.",0,0

The printer is now out of service until I receive replacement cartridges. I do not recommend these cartridges now. I ordered new cartridges from a different seller.There is a reason the seller only guarantees their cartridges for 30 days.Original review:  This is my first order from this seller. I have been using these toner cartridges for almost a month. So far I am impressed with the print quality. My canon MF731cdw immediately recognized the cartridges.

R14VJ9O8QJL3C3,"I purchased the Large, 30 Liter (Model 1108) Safe and was incredibly disappointed. First and foremost you will notice that it is incredibly heavy. 82 Lbs. My fault for not thoroughly reviewing specs before purchasing. After my initial shock at the weight I thought it would be ok since this is going to be on the floor in a closet anyway. Inspecting it further and playing around with the locking mechanisms is the another reason behind my disappointment. The gold/beige clips that hold the lid down are shockingly flimsy and felt like the would break immediately. As a result they are pretty much useless for securing/keeping the lid closed. The next issue was the locking mechanism: it felt cheap and flimsy, they keys barely worked (you had to carefully wiggle the key into the lock to get it to work, I was also afraid I would accidentally break it).Finally the last issue (and the main reason for buying such a safe): Hanging folders. The safe is ever so slightly narrower in the middle, there is a very fine and slight bulge (presumably due to the insulation) but it is just enough for the hanging folders to catch the side and get stuck/fall off the side 'rails'. The ultimate deal breaker was that once you have some hanging folders in the safe you cannot close the lid because there is not enough 'head room' in the lid of the safe. What a complete waste of time and money.Returning this awful product.",0,0

I have been waiting to sharpen my new set of Prismacolor VeriThins.  They come totally unsharpened and I don't know if it's the VeriThins or the sharpener, but it did a horrible job.  I need them to have a very sharp, pointed tip so I set it to the third setting for just such results but not only did it sound like it was eating the pencil, the very sharp tip I wanted is on one side only. My manual sharpeners can't adequately sharpen the unsharpened VeriThins, so now I cannot use them though I need them for the work I'm doing.  Way too much aggravation.

This printer is used for household printing. I had just put in a new cartridge on this date. It was my last backup. I always have an extra cartridge on hand. When I installed one of the new cartridges I got from SHOPLET would not print the color GREEN. I have also purchased a #23 Black. This cartridge will not align in the printer. Shoplet has a warranty of 30 days. The only way this could work is to run out of ink and then order a new cartridge. I will never buy from SHOPLET again.

However, the color cartridges do not print dependably. Different colors print at different times but never all at the same time. I followed the troubleshooting instructions, which say to clean the print heads 3 times (this, by the way, uses about half of the ink in a new cartridge) and waiting 24 hours, and the results were actually worse.

R1WV7ITRP7XSZX,I am very disappointed with this product. I ordered this after reading quite a few good reviews. I was happy at the time that I had picked a good replacement cartridge for my printer. I was wrong.The first thing I ran into was while opening the magenta cartridge to put it in the printer is that it leaked all over my hand. ( I now have pink fingers.) Then as I was about to put in the cartridge I noticed that the tab on the front was broken off. The cartridges can't be installed without the tabs. The second magenta went without incident. Then I moved on to the Cyan cartridges. I found that both of them had the tabs broken off. To make a long story short. I found broken tabs on one yellow and one small black cartridge also. I also ran into leaking ink with the large black cartridge.So in conclusion almost 50% of the ink I purchased is useless. My fingers are now stained black and pink.

R2N0SVW24E89R7,"I am a big fan of Jatstream pens, and I am writing this review to say that this BLX line of Jetstream RT's do not live up to the good name that Jetstream has earned for its superior performance over the years. My main reason for this is at the core of what pens do - make lines. I was consistently disappointed with these pen's ability to pull consistent solid lines at any speed, slow or fast. Now, I use these for writing more than drawing straight lines, and I can say that I have stopped using them for the same reason - inconsistent ink to paper.(I actually took a Jetstream BLK RT and an original blue Jetstream RT side-by-side, and the blue was consistently MUCH more reliable than the BLK, and any speed and for any line.)I may have purchased a bad batch, but at this time I cannot recommend these Jetstreams to anyone, and I will stick to my classic Black and Blue Jetstream RTs (Which are great!)",0,0

The short-lived print quality is nice, but once you look at the cost, you realize the retail price of the printer is less of a gimmick, and more of a bait and switch.  The Artisan 725 is engineered to prevent the use of external ink supplies, available at much reduced rates from third parties right here on Amazon.  I'm looking at my Epson 725, which I have not used for a couple of months now because I refuse to pay their extortionate ink prices and I don't have the time to shop resellers.

You can order them directly from Zebra, but for the $2.50 the vendor charged, Zebra charges 5 times that (of course you probably will get the correct ones), it's cheaper to buy a new pack of pencils.

One of my scanners has a fault. Each and every time I have reached out to them, I get back the same link to the same web page telling me how to clean the scanner. Even if I mention in the ticket that I ALREADY cleaned the scanner. The warranty for the scanner is not worth the paper it is written on (or the electrons you scanned it into).

RYB5O5MWNY8H1,"So far the picture has been pretty dim.  Installation was easy, product arrived in good condition and packaged well and included instructions.  There was no burning smell as stated on some reviews for similar low cost replacement option for the Epson 8350 projector. 2 star rating is only because the picture is just not as good by a wide margin compared to the original bulb.  I can barely watch during the day which was never a problem before.  I have to keep the lights off and watch at night and then the picture is just ok......3 stars in those conditions.  I'm going to double check if there is any alignment procedure I'm not aware of when installing the bulb.  The bulb unit went in so easy and there are only 2 screws....didn't seem like there was any option to make an adjustment forward or backward in positioning.  I will research this and update the rating if anything changes.  Total use is about 1.5 weeks and around 40 hours.  If no better results, I will either return or hold on to this one as a backup to use in between bulb replacements using an original from Epson.  The original bulb must really make the difference in the great picture we had.  I have owned the Epson 8350 for almost 2 years and the original bulb lasted 2,300 hours.

My wife says one star and only because ""zero stars"" is not an option.  My wife is not an overly critical person by nature but her contempt for this model sharpener has no bounds.  She can't get it to work.  She tries gently sticking in the pencil, she tries it forcefully, she tries twisting the pencil as she inserts it...nada, zilch, nothing.  For a while she found that unpluging the power adapter from the unit would cause the sharpner to spring into action, but sadly, no more.  My interactions with the device have been a little better.  I found that if I had a positive attitude when using it, I got better results.  I would say a few encouraging words and I could get one or two pencils sharpened before the thing would refuse to service me anymore.  But if I waited 10 or 20 minutes and came back with some more sweet words of kindness, I could tweak out another sharperning, but really, who has that kind of time.  Trying to get through a pack of 20 pencils for your kids' school supplies on a Sunday night can take the better part of the evening if my patience persists and meanwhile my wife is in the other word calling the machine names that I cannot repeat here.

R2763TO0VJEOLB,"While these labels (and numerous similar ones in other sizes) are very useful around the house, a design change in the last year or two has added a fatal flaw. Previously, the labels had an overprinted border so you could see where the label stopped and the background paper started. Now, probably;as a cost-cutting measure, the individual labels no longer have a printed border. As a result, it's very difficult to tell whether you're writing on the label or the background paper. I've wasted I don't know how many labels by going off the label and writing on the background. It helps to fold the label along the border edges  so you can see where the label stops, but even this doesn't always solve the problem. It's really too bad, because the older labels really deserved five stars, but without the printed border, the labels are much more difficult to use, imho.

R183J2XL4783KN,"I bought the HP ""3 ink cartridge"" in July 2020.  I did not need the magenta cartridge until October 2020 (I had previously used the cyan and yellow cartridges and they worked normally).  The product expiration date is 01/2022.  At first I could not get the cartridge to work at all, even after re-seating it numerous times.  I called Amazon customer support and was informed that their warranty is for 30 days, but that HP would cover the warranty.  I called HP customer support and was told that they do not warranty ink cartridges that are not sold by HP, and that Amazon is responsible.  I called back Amazon.  Of course when I re-seated the cartridge again while on the phone call, my printer 'recognized' it and I was able to print.  The color is not normal, but it is 'red'.  So at that point I dropped the issue with Amazon, who was nothing but helpful.  This review is to let you know that if you buy HP ink on Amazon and do not try ALL the cartridges within 30 days, and try to get satisfaction from HP, they will NOT cover the warranty even though it is a genuine HP product sold by Amazon.  I did end up buying, 1-day delivery, an 'off-brand' set of ink cartridges from Amazon (manufacturer: iKong) so that my printer would at least print (it will not print at all unless ALL the cartridges are full enough) while I was awaiting an outcome on the HP ink cartridge, which I could NOT get in 1-day.  Well, the iKong cartridges print in non-smeary, nice color and the 3 cartrige colors were about 1/3 of the price the HP cartridges were.  So guess what?  I will NEVER buy HP ink refil cartridges again, as they do NOT stand behind their product.",0,0

I followed the instructions that came with it, on what to do in such an event, but it did not help.  The price seemed too good to be true and apparently it is. UPDATE - they sent me replacement cartridges for free after just a few days, so great customer service, I'm giving them another star for that. Apparently the chips on the cartridges needed updating.  I'll update again once I see if they work properly. UPDATE 2 - These $18 cartridges have now cost me $350. To their credit, the company sent me a new set within a couple of days, but I needed to get some printing done immediately so I bought a proper OEM set of cartridges.  Within a few pages the Cyan started printing very streaky.  I have done all of the resets, cleanings and alignments several times but I think the ink from the Fuzoo cartridges clogged the print head.  The new print head is about $120.  A new printer is $129.  Of course the updated version of the exact same printer takes different ink cartridges, so I had to buy a set of those at $110.  So I spent $250 for the new printer and ink, plus $100 for the new OEM cartridges that are still brand new and full in the now useless printer. You could say I am not pleased with my experience. Since you can not give 0 stars, I will give the minimum 1 star, that's for their customer service.

The software is clumsy, and makes you wonder how this can be considered a productivity tool.The while you can scan at a reasonable pace (I have no issue with the scanner), the scanned receipts pile up in the cue (my computer is reasonably well resourced and reasonably new).The character recognition software is weak enough that vendors are rarely identified, total amounts are frequently incorrect, and dates are frequently wrong.While reviewing and correcting your receipts, it does not appear that you can always navigate where you need to go using the keyboard. Plus, when using the mouse, repeated clicks are required in most fields to gain focus for editing. The software appears to try to maintain your sort order (ok, a good thing), but when you are editing the field on which you are sorted, the row will move to its properly sorted order, and you all of the sudden find yourself viewing and editing a different receipt (not so good). Then, off you go searching for your original row so you can finish editing.Additionally, the database is PAINFULLY SLOW, the dollar Amount field is left justified (making it hard to visually scan), and the use of real estate on the screen is inefficient and there is simply not enough control over it.

I was tired of spending the money on the bug name brands, so I gave this Law of Attraction a try and am pretty disappointed, in all honest.

R3S55U5PYKTJB7,"CEASED PRINTING AFTER JUST A FEW MONTHS - Print head was clogged just a few short months into the life of this printer.  I didn't know what the problem was though so I bought new XL cartridges thinking it needed new ink and of course it still would not print.  The 5690 printed very poor quality pages for a few months before never working again.  Unfortunately I bought this when it was 369 USD, whereas now I see them for 210 USD.  I used the cleaning feature to no avail and even hired a computer technician who told me it might be a loss!  Because of the hundreds of dollars already spent on this printer itself and on two sets of XL cartridges, am going to try the home cleaning kit as a last resort.  I can't believe it came highly rated in Consumer Reports, which is what prompted me to spend 369 on an inkjet printer in the first place.  Also, even in its short life when it was printing shoddy pages of text, it was VERY difficult to connect to any device via wi-fi and required turing the wi-fi off and on.  Even tech savvy visitors became so frustrated in trying to get the connection to work.  Terrible experience and such a great loss financially.",0,0
R27FCNIMOYEFXN,"Decided to give this a try based off all the reviews. It arrived fairly quickly with the 1,000 staples. The stapler feel is nice. That is where the good stuff ends. The stapler couldnt get through 3-4 pieces of paper before each staple fell apart. I went through at least a hundred staples through the 3-4 pieces of paper. The original paper that I initially started with. The reviews I find hard to believe are anywhere near accurate or believable, based off the performance of this stapler. I did initiate a return and was ready to drop it off, however i was refunded and told to keep it. I really dont want it, because it doesnt work.",0,0
R1N5230REJAIR4,"I have used the two black cartridges. I write books for my grandkids and print and bind a copy for each of 10 kids.The first cartridge is put in, ran for about half a book and then printed everything in light blue, possibly using my blue color cartridge to do so.  Since the books are printed in bookfold I had to hand feed almost an entire book on both sides of the paper to make up for the bad cartridge.  I replaced it with the other black cartridge and so far it seems to be doing fine.The odd thing is that i can hear the ink sloshing in the cartridge when i shake it, but it doesn't deliver.  i removed the tape and the cartridge worked for a little while and then just quit.So my review is going to be mixed.  I really need to find a good source of cheaper ink, and I trusted the reviews, but now I'm leery of buying this again and no, I would not recommend it to a friend.",0,0

Other cartridges read just fine, so the printer is not the problem.

I ended up with a 3.8mm pen that is not for letter-writing at all, which is 100% my mistake and not a fault of the pen, but renders it useless to me.The ink flows well, but it tends to get blotchy, and the ink quality is low - it runs slightly, sinks through paper, and it only about 90% opaque. The pen has an excellent feel to it and the design is brilliant, but the low quality of the ink cartridges and the cheap feel of it doesn't impress me as much as it has apparently impressed other reviewers.

R2M023GNPWMHXF,I just printed something and it worked fine on my Kodak ESP 3250 which takes Kodak 10.

R3H6OLYULMEYV1,"Update: After this cheap ink clogged up my Canon iP100 printer, I tried everything but there was only one fix that actually worked.  I removed the cartridges and print head, and soaked the print head in cups alternating with Windex (or ammonia) and Reverse Osmosis (or distilled) water.  I soaked it for a few hours until all the ink was out of the print head.  I removed the thin cleaning pads on the right side of the printer using a long-nose plier similar to a tweezer, and also soaked and cleaned those of the all the goo.  I cleaned that area of the printer using Windex and Q-tips.  I don't know if I harmed the printer by doing this, but at least now it works.  I thought maybe I'd have to throw away the printer, before this fix.  I will never buy these junk refills again, I'll stick with the genuine Canon cartridges.Original review:Update: after the LD cartridge printed with the wrong ink level, I can't get the nozzle unclogged on my IP100 printer no matter what I try with the utilities.  I think this LD cartridge messed up my print head.I bought a pack of these cartridges because of the good price, but now I'm going back to Canon genuine ink.  The Canon ink level indicator shows that I have about 25% of ink remaining in the color LD tank, but it's printing awful gaps.  The color ink has run out prematurely.

So while this turned out to be a very good machine until it started to leak  I’m giving it a very low rating because of the fact it does not last long it’s not like it was being moved around or anything just sitting in one place and starts to fall apart I will have to try and buy another one but definitely not from this merchant,0,0

I don't understand where the good reviews are coming from, I honestly think they're paid tbh. This made a MESS of my printer. Started off with very faint but still noticeable lines, so I ran a head clean which I hate doing because it eats up about 30% of the ink. Everything got WAY worse after this... my trusty Epson Artisan started printing without cyans altogether. I quickly removed the faulty ink before it could do any more damage.If you run a business where you need good quality prints and have a solid printer (like Artisan 1430) that you do not want to risk damaging, don't waste your time or money.

R2BU4A614Z0N21,"Am on my third one from Epson and still having problems.  Using genuine ink we have had a variety of problems in our small business.  The concept is good but the printer itself just hasn't delivered.  I'm not that picky but this thing can't function as good as a $50 throw away printer.Update 3.21.16 my review to Epson:Everything works great except the printing. (This is a printer after all) . Wifi, Lan, ADF, Scan to email, all wonderful. This printer was first purchased when it was new technology. (Oct 2014)  We use this printer in a small business environment but we are on our 4th replacement from Epson and now Epson refuses to work with us.  Out of warranty.  My main complaint is misaligned text and lines through text. This has been a common theme with this printer.  I've run countless nozzle cleanings and alignments but to no avail.  I use genuine Epson ink and staples general printer paper.  So there is no mystery there.  The printer is in a closed office with two office managers and a controlled climate.  Ie constant temperatures and minimal air particulates.  I like to think I'm not that picky but I firmly believe that hard to read text is an issue, so is smearing and random splotches of color.  I have used Epson products for years and still have an epson printer at home that works just great but this 5690 series for us has really left a bad tasted in my mouth.  Service recently told me that I can buy a new printer at a reduced rate (loyalty program)  Why would I want another epson when the one I have doesn't work? Probably going to try out a canon or xerox multifunction. Hopefully the epson projector I just bought works better.",0,0
R14ZFNIJ77ILKW,"This may be more a review of Amazon's business practice issues than the scanner, but I wanted to bring it up.I received the item in a box with ZERO packing material around it, as usual from Amazon, in a box several times larger than the box the item was in.  This made me cringe, since this was an electronic device and probably should not be crashed around in a box during transit.  I had paid $12 for two-day shipping and got the poor packaging for my money. (Absolutely no items I have ordered from Amazon have ever get packed properly for their nature, as in breakable items are always just thrown in the box.)My fears came true.  The scanner was completely non-functional.  There is seemingly a power light, this never came on when plugged in, if that is the function of that part (I cannot find any information about that on their web site).  My computer eventually did recognize the existence of the scanner, but the scanner itself was totally unresponsive.  No power light, no ""grabbing"" of the inserted paper (I was even using the ""calibration paper"" they included with the scanner), and the scan button was not clickable on the scanner or in the software program.  After uninstalling and reinstalling the software and trying multiple other USB ports, I was once able to click on the 'scan' button on the program, but got a message that the scanner was unable to scan and then the option to do so again was greyed out again.At first, I downloaded the update, then uninstalled that and put the original software back on but there was no change.  I suspect that this particular scanner was returned to Amazon.com by someone else because it was broken, and then it was sent to me; the software disc was opened and the CD sleeve was torn and wrinkled.Do note that the software that comes with the scanner is from 2008, and you have to go download the newer version (only if you know if your computer is 32 bit or 64 bit), and then *that* software uninstalls everything you just spent 15 minutes installing.I have requested a replacement, as I really need this item's features to manage an immense mountain of receipts, but am not terrible hopeful that the outcome will be different with the second one unless Amazon bothers to pack their items properly for once.  As for the scanner itself, I will have to come back and add to this review if the next one they send me actually works.EDIT:  The second one arrived within one day of my asking for an exchange, though Amazon charged me for shipping on the second scanner even though it was their error.  It did come with one sheet of bubble wrap laid over top of the scanner, woo.The second one seems to work properly.  It does not obtain all of the information off of many receipts; it hardly ever gets the name of the business or the sales tax.  You will have to type these in yourself.  The software is not very organized in that the ability to create categories is limited to the pre-defined ones in the program and duplicate categories are easy to make if you try to define your own sub-categories.  As an example ""Personal Expenses"" is one of the three choices, and you have to put all personal expenses under that heading and still try to separate them somehow.  Not terribly intuitive or helpful.  I have not yet tried to export to Quicken, but will as soon as possible.",0,0

R13WPJLU9L5X1B,"I consider myself a very informed consumer especially on fountain pens. I enjoy them very much but something about spending 50$+ on a pen always requires a lot of mental brainwashing with positive reviews/feedback to get me to buy a $$$ pen. I often make this comparison, I can buy a Table saw... or a fountain pen! Yes they are indeed instruments of luxury and I am as frugal as it gets so it makes a bitter standstill sometimes. However if you are like me and read even a little into fountain pens you will find Pilot pens to be dripping in positivity. Their metropolitan,74, Falcon, ect. The list goes on. I have used every one and let me tell you none (including this one) have done anything for me.The pen itself is well build and it gives thick durable feel to it, something you know would withstand a drop. It weighs 22.36g with a CON-70 converter in it half full. Which to reference is less than a metropolitan (27.28g). If you are someone who likes huge, thick, heavy pens this one is right on the acceptable line. It's a standard thickness in the hand for a pen. Overall this pen is an okay looking pen, I personally believe the saying ""beauty is in the eye of the beholder"" to be untrue as almost everyone can tell you what is nice looking and what is not. By that standard I can say I think you will find this pen to not be very eventful looking. The cap is a screw on/off which I enjoy very much as it adds a level of security to potential splashes from drops and or just general lugging around. The nib is silver not the gold tint that you see here. Don't Panic! it's gold. If you look at the nib it will say 14k. The build quality is the only reason for the 2 stars.Writing is what you would expect from a Pilot Pen. Awful, inconsistent, Skippy at best. The pen will write very good so long as you only write down. So if your name is ilililil you're in good shape, my name however is nick and when wrote with this pen it comes out as ""l l i c l"". A majority of the days this pen choose to write dry (that's what I wanted) however during this time your pen will often bottom out and not lay down any ink and skip. Other days it will chose to write like a wet medium which makes your handwriting look like a gorilla wrote it, thick and bumpy. The nib is as springy as you would expect from a gold nibbed pen but that really is about it. The reason I was so persistent on pilots was because positive reviews and the statement that eastern pens supposedly have finer nibs. This is partially true, outside of some German pens most fines are about all the same. My Parker and Lamy write just as fine as this. So the allure to stick to eastern pens just because of a finer fine is so negligible.What I don't understand is the ?fan base? of pilot pens. Doing deeper reading on this pen you will find it's inconsistency to be a not so much a problem but a guarantee. The fountain pen community is a very tight-knit community and most well seasoned fountain pen owners DO NOT recommend this pen or the 92 for the same reasons above. However there is always a group of people that love their pilot pens. There is a story of a guy who got a pilot 92 that didn't work day 1. He sent it in to pilot for repair and after 3 send backs to pilot later to get it fixed and 4 months of down time it still came back still inconsistent, the guy was bummed but still LOVED his junk pen. All in all after getting burned by multiple pilot pens at varying price points I can say for certain I will never buy a Pilot again, the proof is in the writing.Buy a Lamy 2000, now that is a thing to behold.",0,0
R1XR0FSW709INL,"The toners worked initially, but after using them for a bit (you can see how much toner is left in each in the photos above) they started to streak and produce weaker colors than other toners I've used before.

RQJ9DM88W875R,"UPDATE FROM RECENT PURCHASE (1 June 2013):So, I initially bought one of these bulbs in 2012 for my Epson Home Cinema 8500UB, and it was amazing -- great color for a fraction of the price, and I gave it a 5 star rating. The bulb lasted about 1400 hours before it became dimmer and dimmer, and fearing that it was going to go out, I decided to buy two more of them.And something has clearly changed within the last year, because both of these bulbs were made differently. They were difficult to fit in the projector, to the point where -- for each of them -- I had to remove a screw to keep both of them in.And, more disturbingly, the brightness was HORRIBLE out of the box. Worse yet, when an image went from dark to light, you could watch the bulb change -- almost as if it couldn't handle the changes in dynamic brightness. I was really concerned that my projector was broken, but before looking at a repair that was a few hundred dollars, on a lark I decided to order a genuine Epson bulb for $299 from their site.Not only did it fit right in, but the bulb is AMAZINGLY bright than either of the new ones were. No more generic bulbs for me.",0,0

When I pulled the nib out to put in a refill, ink was found all over the inside of the pen.update.... I found the issue to be that the moron who put the cartridge inside the pen, put it in backwards.

R1T11TEBLQXM1Y,"We bought this printer last summer when we wanted to upgrade to a wireless printer. We selected this model because it had good reviews and had multiple color cartridges and would more efficiently use ink. This printer does many things well. It prints well over wireless.  It prints pictures wonderfully.  BUT even set on the thick paper setting, it is an effort in frustration to print on cardstock. (And sadly, I need to do this often!)This morning, I  spent over an hour trying to print 12 copies on cardstock.  Even putting in one piece of paper at a time, I had to reload it 8 times due to error messages indicating the paper was loaded improperly and it jammed 3 times.

I don't think I have ever had any luck when I get neon colored pens. In addition to the lack of ink, I got a pen that doesn't even have a tip on the end so it just leaks out. On a good note, they did a great job with the colors and design of everything. It comes in a great case too, but I can't use pens that are scratchy cause the ink isn't coming out or something.

R1PG78LJ4475PP,"I replaced the base plate on my office chair with this and for all intents it looks and feels really similar, but after sitting on it for two days the front of the chair now slopes forward slightly and it keeps triggering the air canister to send the chair to its maximum height (and to RELEASE it!). So when I stand up, the chair goes all the way up like I'm triggering the lever on the side, and when I sit down the chair goes all the way down as if it's being released.This is ridiculous. I replaced the old one because it was extremely creaky after 5 years of use and day one, this seemed perfect. Now it's ALSO slightly creaky and it's doing this silly nonsense with the air canister, at this point I'd rather just buy a new chair.Two stars because it technically does/did fit and screw in properly, it's just functionally useless aside from that!---------------------------------------------------------------------------Update, dropped it to one star because it actually fits SO POORLY that it bent a heavy duty gas canister out of shape. That mechanism it kept triggering because it was ill-fit? Yeah, it actually was pressing down on the top at a bad angle and every time it ""dropped me"" because the mechanism was perpetually triggered, it dropped me onto the thin stem of the gas canister and over the last couple weeks it slowly bent forward until the whole front of the chair drooped downward.Of course it's well past the return window, so, I'm just out that money.

R1GITT316Q8BKX,"I rarely find myself dissatisfied after purchasing items that have generally high ratings and positive reviews. This particular tape - of all things - had to be the exception to that norm.My ask of sticky tapes is simple - hold brown corrugated paper boxes together, be easy to apply, easy to tear. The last of these is generally an issue with other packing tapes - you need a pair of scissors or a knife to cleanly cut the tape off. This tape, without any doubt, makes it very easy to hand-tear when you are done.However, I also expect a sticky tape to actually stick. The material used here is much thicker than regular tapes, and if you don't stick it back onto itself (i.e. going all around the box), the edges start curling up and coming loose after a few days. I used this tape, for example, to stick some labels on to cleaning fluid spray bottles, and all of them have come off after a few months.I went back to the basic Scotch disposable dispenser with packing tape -  http://amzn.com/B003W0P2SA - and love it.

R1FYHLGT5H1VG5,"We purchased the neat Scanner 15 months ago and have really liked how it helped to organize all of our business receipts. heck, we even talked a friend of ours into buying one.  Then after about a year, all the problems started. It became very difficult to import/export old files, would only scan 1 receipt at a time, many issues with the files and folders and finally unreadable scans. When I called customer service, (and I say that GENEROUSLY) the first time I was told to delete a QSP file to get it to scan more than one receipt at a time which worked but then the images were so bad that you cant read them. So I called them again and got a woman who had me calibrate, calibrate, plug, unplug, etc. (she was so pressed to get me off the phone that I actually mentioned it to her) and I still got no results, just a promise that someone would get back with me after I emailed her an image of a poor quality receipt so they could determine what the problem was. Cricket....cricket....cricket.....cricket.....In the meantime I ordered more cleaning sheets and calibration papers,  and calibrated and cleaned with still no change. It was 4 days and no phone call or email, so I called again. This time I spoke with another woman who had me take another scan and when I told her it was still hard to read, she said that she was ""determining at this time that your scanner is defective"" and more or less let me know that I would not be receiving any more help. Of course after reading all the reviews, which I wish I would have read before I bought it, and having my own experience with 'customer service' I was not surprised at the rudeness of this girl. However, I was given the offer to buy a new one for $100.00 less, ($299.99). When I asked her if she was aware of the reviews that say that this product does not last much more than 12-18 months she says 'well some customers get two years'. WOW!!!! So I guess if you want to buy a new scanner every 1-2 years at 400.00 a pop, then this is the scanner for you. As for me, I'm looking elsewhere. For all those who give this 5 stars, please let us know how you like it after 12-18 months.

R1E09XYJ7IR9WA,"To start I gave this item two stars only because the over all style, the size and the color of the stain are exactly what I was looking for. However the execution of it was terrible. As soon as I saw it I immediately bought it because it was exactly what I was looking for and I thought it was adorable. I couldn’t wait for it to arrive and it came early, even better! So I thought, until I opened the box. As soon as I lifted it out of the box the bubble wrap bag drooped as if something was weighing down (very thin bubble wrap bag at that). The item weighing it down was the broken drawer front of one of the center drawers. Split clean just under the handle, the drawer front didn’t just come off the sides it snapped 9/10s of the way down, shown in my pictures. Immediately after that I noticed the texture of the wood is very rough, it doesn’t seem sanded down nearly enough, to the point where in some places I was worried about getting a splinter. Looking at it further I found visible nail holes on every side from where it was nailed together, something that could’ve easily be hidden with a little wood filler and a little sanding. There are dents and dings in multiple places but that kind of adds to the charm so whatever. Then I looked inside one of the intact drawers and there is an exposed nail that could easily cut your finger open you weren’t paying attention. If this item had been an absolute bargain I would’ve over looked some of these issues and simply asked for a replacement for the broken drawer, but considering I spent $70 I’m very disappointed. And to add a cherry on top, based on other reviews, I don’t feel confident I would get an adequate piece in replacement! Overall I do not recommend this piece from this company AT ALL!!

R2L4ATNVBN69A9,"I purchased this product and from the very start, the scans were virtually unreadable. If it were possible to give it less than one star, I would have. I repeatedly calibrated the device with no improvement. I called their customer service number for assistance and got a voice message to visit their website for assistance, either open a customer service ticket or speak with a representative in ""live chat."" No where on their website was an option for live chat. After submitting two tickets, each with attached images of the scan quality, I then went on to look for information on how I could modify brightness and contrast, hoping this would help. The manuals (not included, but on-line) indicated a tool option that should appear at the bottom right corner of the scan image. I could find no such option there or in the menu options. It's been two days and no word from Neat. I have run, crisp, clear, wrinkle-free receipts through this repeatedly after calibration and tried every possible setting before hand in hopes of a better scan with no luck. This is a piece of junk and I've never been sorrier to buy a product. The IRS would never accept these receipt ""scans"" (and I use the term loosely) as documented proof of expenses. Meanwhile, I spent the same amount of time the following day (that I did the day I set it up and tried to resolve the scan quality issue) entering 6 months of receipts by hand in a simple profit and loss spread sheet I customized in Excel and hand enter my purchases, keeping the hard receipts for my backup.

R2ZZPP7VZEU5QU,"I bought the undated planner as a gift for my cousin. She has been using the LOA planner since 2016 and has refused to change to another planner, she loved her LOA planner. However, when it arrived we saw that the font and color of the planner has changed from the one purchased June 2018 (she did not like that) and that it was missing pages (skips from page 30 to 41) and pages 41-51 were falling off. Page 51 had numbers written in the date boxes (not accurate to July's dates) and there was writing on the back pages (""Serendipity"") as well as some of the stickers were missing but no where to be found on the planner. This looks like a cheaper and fake version of her previous LOA planner. It also shows how poorly Freedom Mastery checks their product before sending it to a customer.

R2J7PIYW24I3SU,"I owned this projector for nearly three years and it was pretty good. Buying bulbs is a pain, but that was the trade off for having a huge screen minus a big, giant television in my living room.Also, know that the hours you get out of a bulb are nowhere near what the bulb manufacturer's advertise. That goes for the non-generic Epson bulbs, too. They advertise a few thousand hours, but we were getting under 1,000 hours (800 usually). Also, the picture gets darker the last fifty hours or so of viewing causing some eye strain.The one star: I bought a bulb off of Amazon, more specifically through a Seller. I installed the bulb (my third or fourth) and within a minute or so of being turned on I smelled burning plastic. The red warning lights were on and I Immediately shut off the projector. The projector was really hot, so I let it cool down and put in my old bulb, that still worked. The projector now did not work at all.We took the projector into a repair service to have it diagnosed and they told us the motherboard was burned out and it would cost so much to repair we may as well buy a new one.That one, stupid bulb fried my projector.We contacted the Seller several times who said it was our projector not his bulb. After doing a little research we found out the Seller was doing business from out of an apartment in Queens. This was a Seller on Amazon. Shady.We contacted Amazon to let them know and to try to get some compensation for what was a $1600 projector. They also refused to take any responsibility for having a Seller that sold a defective product that destroyed our projector. We tried to deal with Customer Service many times, but like a typical internet company their customer service is completely lousy and they just send you around in circles.So, be careful in buying generic bulbs, be careful in what Sellers you use because some are shady and Amazon will not back you up with their ""A-Z guarantee"" if you have any problems. In the end, we just went to Best Buy and dealt with a lovely salesperson and bought a 55 inch Sharp that was on sale for less than the cost to get our projector fixed.

R1JZMZFX0MX3VJ,"Previously, I have given this item four stars.  It's been a year now that I've been using the pencils, and I've finally declared the experiment a failure.  I've given up and revoked my 4-star rating & downgraded to a 2-star.The pencils are fine, when they work.  But the quality control just isn't there.  The last pack of pencils I bought all failed within 2 weeks.  That's a loss of 5 pencils in half a month.  And that's abysmal.  I've had other pencils jam or fail to advance at a rate of about 1 every two weeks.  At the costs I've calculated at the bottom of this review, I can buy standard 4B pencils at almost half the cost of one of these and it will last the same two weeks.It's a shame, because I really wanted this to work out.  I really like the idea, but the build quality just isn't there.  I cannot recommend this pencil.Here is the original review, if you are still interested:This is the second pack of these I've purchased.  The first pack was of two - one stopped working after a few weeks, and the second was stolen.  I've been using my latest pencil for a few weeks and can provide a pretty definitive report on the two samples I've used for the past month, I think.The casing on these pencils is plastic, of course, and I found it difficult to get a grip on them at first.  They look like wood, but aren't, and I think I had to teach myself how to hold them so they don't slip out of my fingers, the friction coefficient on plastic being different than the wood they look like but aren't.  Maybe it was just me.The eraser is permanently attached to the end - you can't change it.  That's a bummer, because you can't put in a new eraser when the one attached wears out.  But if you are using a mechanical pencil in the first place, you probably don't make that many mistakes to begin with.  Mechanical pencils are not for the error-prone.  That being said, the erasers are pretty tough.  They work well, with very little wear.  I think it is highly unlikely that you would wear out the eraser in the lifetime of the pencil.  And if you think you would, then go back to a regular disposable pencil - mechanical pencils are clearly not your thing.The automatic feed is great, most of the time.  I like that I don't have to advance the pencil lead, or worry if it is too long - the pencil takes care of it.  Sometimes it advances it a little too far, but not so far that it becomes a problem.  The feed is a little short more often, forcing you to write straight up, instead of at a more natural angle.  This usually rectifies itself as you write, so no big worries.Damp paper/conditions have an adverse affect.  Sometimes, when I try to write on damp paper, the automatic feed doesn't work right, and I have to jab the paper to get the lead to advance.  It's not a big deal, and it doesn't happen often, but it does happen occasionally, especially in my line of work, so I keep a backup handy.You can't see the progression of the lead.  Most mechanical pencils are clear, so you can judge how short the lead is, and when it might be time to change it.  This pencil is opaque, so you have to guess when the lead needs to be changed.  I've found that you need to just use it until it stops working, then change the lead.  Changing the lead is easy, just unscrew the top, drop in a new one, and screw it closed, but there is absolutely no warning that the lead will fail.  And that leads me to my last, and biggest complaint:The automatic feed does not use all of the lead.  Unlike most mechanical pencils that will use a lead down to a nubbin, the automatic pencil leaves a considerable amount of unused lead when it stops writing.  I suspect that it's something about how much lead the automatic system needs to operate being much more than a manual pencil needs.  It's not that big of a deal because you get four leads with each pencil, and leads aren't that expensive anyway, but it is surprising how much lead is ejected from the pencil when you reload it after it stops writing.I've read complaints about short lifespan with these pencils.  I've only had one pencil fail on me after a few weeks of daily use, so I'm not in a position to comment on it.  I think that the idea behind these pencils is to have it be cheap and easy enough to use that you don't mind losing one from time to time, rather than an being an expensive, high-performance pencil, that you will kick yourself if you lose it.  And if you are in a place where your pencil might be stolen or lost, then better a 2$ one than a 20$ one, right?  Besides, I like the simplicity of the pencil itself.  No buttons, no clips - just a standard No. 2 that never goes dull.  Outstanding.UPDATE: So I've been using these pencils since mid-July.  I've since had 5 pencils break, and one that was stolen.  So, doing the math, (4 months[rounded] x 30 days[avg mo.] = 120[days]/5[pencils lost due to wear, not counting the stolen one] = 3.4 weeks average pencil life.  At the current price of a 5-pack, you would spend 2.50$ every three+ weeks, or the entire amount of 12.52$ every 4 months, given the rate of attrition.  For me, that's a good deal, especially when I always have a sharp point and don't have to waste time constantly sharpening up a pencil.  I replaced the standard HB lead with a B lead and the pencils work much better under the harder conditions I subject them too.  I stick with my four star rating because the basic shortcomings outlined above have not been overcome by Ticonderoga.  I would still recommend this item.",0,0
R2548CSB77ZNQW,"I have had the portable scanner for several years.  I use it to scan all my receipts for personal use.  I also use quicken.  The original software ""proprietary system of filing"" was OK, but not great.  I was able to use it to handle all of my receipts, 5-10 a day.  The software recognition at that time was not great requiring me to edit all of my receipts, but I learned how to use it.Upgrading to the 5.0, the software filing system that now comes with the scanner, has been more frustrating than any other software experience.  Other than Quicken's biyearly extortion, this takes the cake.  With Quicken you begrudgingly pay the fee because in the end, the program still works and even with all the problems and the fact that it is not perfect, you always know you can get by with it.Now the scanner with the new 5.0 software seems to do a much better job of recognizing the information on the receipt and getting it correct.  However, the filing system and program is far from intuitive requiring a significant amount of time reviewing the instructions.  Even then, again, it is not intuitive and also it is cumbersomely slow.If you have 100 receipts in a folder, you can count on the program taking over 20 seconds to load.  This means that switching between folders is time consuming and frustrating.  Accidentally clicking a folder with 2-300 receipts will have your blood pressure up and your anger at a maximum as there is nothing you can do until the computer loads the entire folder.  Each folder is loaded as you click on it, again and again, so if you go from one folder to another, you must wait each time.It is a great concept, but the software based on my use and based on my readings of what professional software developers have to say on the internet is nearly worthless unless you are only storing a few receipts a month.I wanted this program to easily search through years of receipts in order for me not to have to go through hundreds of receipts by hand in multiple shoe boxes of receipts.  When I need a receipt for a return, I wanted to search it on the computer and find where it is to make getting the original easier.  Just having the receipts on the computer does not help as most stores will not accept a printed copy of the receipt.  For on line purchaces and warranty, it is useful if transmitting a copy of the receipt will work.  However, I find most still want you to mail the original.  This means you still must have a hard copy in a filing cabinet and an antiquated filing system to parallel this computerized version.  Still the concept and how I used it worked pretty good.  However, the new software makes the supposedly easy time saving task a Herculean effort.  After spending all the money on the product and years of use, I find that a good file cabinet with folders works much better and easier than the new 5.0 upgrade or rather what is currently being sold.Here is what I want to be able to do with the system.  I want to double click on the icon and have the program boot immediately.  I want to take the receipts from my wallet and scan them quickly into the scanner.  I then want to review my receipts from an un-reviewed folder and migrate them into the proper folders.  This was the way the older program worked.  I want to switch back and forth from folder to folder and have the folder already loaded and available like the old program or Quicken, so I don't have to wait for each folder to load, each time.  I don't want to have to limit my folder sizes because the program takes too long to load a folder with more than 10 receipts.  These are the things I want from a system, but sadly the new 5.0 upgrade and program that is sold with the scanners today does not deliver.As a stand alone portable scanner, it has given me years of trouble free use.  So far I really have nothing bad to say about the actual physical tool.  I appreciate the improvements in receipt recognition with the 5.0 upgrade as it is rather good.  However, the program is just not intuitive, it is not easy, and it is frustratingly slow and cumbersome to the point of annoyance.The one star rating may not be totally accurate as there are good things to say about this, but in the end the negatives make this nearly unusable as an efficient way to digitally file receipts and I could not in good conscience get someone to invest the time and effort into a new filing system that does not make their filing easier.  You still need hard copies of receipts for just about everything but the IRS.  The old physical filing cabinet and folders worked great for probably over 100 years and being you still need it, I cant say the effort of digitizing the receipts with this system is worth your time and effort the way it currently stands.",0,0

In giving it the benefit of the doubt, I extended the legs and tilted the laptop base (which only has a one-sided hinge, made out of plastic, and really flimsy). I placed my 16.5"" laptop on the tray and it slid right off onto the bed (thank God). I tried it again making sure I had the laptop base behind the ""ledge"" so it would stay. Evidently, the ""ledge"" wasn't tall enough, because my computer slid off again. Pretty frustrated by now, I placed a microfiber towel underneath so it would keep the computer from sliding (that helped). When I set up my mouse, and being right handed, it worked out great because there is only one choice in mouse placement...on the right side...FAIL.

R3QL8M0PCLXK83,"I dislike how much these pens skip. The only way I can keep the pen from skipping is to push down pretty hard to keep the ink flowing. It's like you have to push the roller ball out of the way so the ink can come out. This makes it really uncomfortable for writing. The cushion grip is on the firm side. I find the ink to be very thin and watery, not like other gel pens I've used. It does make the ink dry faster, but it also makes the line come out pretty wide. The ink colors don't always match the pen color, although I don't really mind that much. For example, the magenta color is pretty light, the medium blue looks more light teal, the red is really bright, almost a deep orange-y red, and the navy is nearly black.

For example, there are approximately 8 cards you might classify as ""red,"" so if you're trying to match a red hue that doesn't fit one of those 8 reds, you're out of luck. And that's being generous on the color range; some of those are more pink or orange, so there are really like 3 true variations on red.On top of that, the ""1210 shades"" really are just shades: they're a halftone tint that doesn't really give you any new color information regarding the print look itself, it just shows you what less of that color will look like on the page. In contrast, the Pantone CMYK or Bridge books give you thousands of distinct ink mixes with different CMYK values, which is an entirely different world if you want to try to match something and understand the result of a little more black, or a little less yellow.It's definitely a great value, and that's why I'm choosing 2 instead of 1 stars: you can get a good idea of what various basic colors will look like printed, and maybe you can fudge and average between two close colors to get something in the middle. For my needs however, it looks like I'll have to invest in the Pantone bridge book, with thousands of real hue and color mix variations.Since there are few 1- or 2- star reviews on this, I brought it down a bit to highlight these discrepancies—but if what you want is to have a variety of hues and start to build your instincts for how CMYK will vary from screen to print, this is a good basic start, and you certainly shouldn't spend more if you don't need it. However, if you're doing real print work often, the Pantone guides are the standard for a reason. I just wish I could borrow them from the library for the 1 or 2 times per year I really need them...",0,0

So the new owners of Parker decided to  shave a few more pennies of profit out of this little pen, changed the metal they used, probably even the quality of the plastic barrel, dropped the wonderful little logo on top of the clicker, and who knows what else.

R1I1FO7JS922XU,"When you look at the different reviews, it's really hard to know what your experience will be.  I saw that most said their bulb worked well.  Mine did not.  It was WAY dimmer (like 75% dimmer) than my previous bulb which already had 2500 hours on it.  Also, the colors were way off, like a red tint to everything.  Perhaps because it was so dim it didn't push light through properly, but I'm not sure.  In any case, the bulb is useless to me, and I'm asking for a refund on it.Another note, if you get a smell to a new projector bulb, that's really normal.  After several hours of use, it should be burned in properly.  As for the one I received in particular, I even wondered if perhaps I had received a used bulb somehow, but it did have that distinctive burning smell to it.  So I'm thinking the one I got just has to be defective.",0,0
R3W1I4I15B7QLH,Although this seems like a great deal the post it note pads are very thin and only contain 25 notes in each so only 300 post its in each pack.  I compared them to the others assuming there was 1200 notes in each pack.  There are way better deals in bulk packs to be found on Amazon.  Like 700 notes for $4.00 as an add on item.  I should have read the other reviews as someone already pointed this out but I was dumb enough to just look at all the five star reviews.  I won't bother returning them but I won't be buying these again.  They are nice bright colors and they say super sticky on the pack so these are perhaps high end ones that cost more.

R38LPRG6JR0ZT5,"You can read all the positives on other reviews.. all true. It's nice, unless you use a mouse. The panel that slides out is a shade on the small side, but manageable. What makes it absolutely unusable is the fact that the surface is so slippery, the mouse slides off the second you lift your hand.

R1DZY3G6LJKRIM,"(adding this to the review below:  The company, Honeywell, or whatever their US business name is, is terrible.  Trying to get answers our of them is like puling teeth and they.  They rarely call back.  They are vague with their answers.  They basically ask you to buy and use this on faith.  No one from there has yet to respond to how do the plastic clasps work if a fire melts them?  Nobody has yet to answer how it works for digital media if it isn't certified for that.  Really poor no matter how good or bad the chest is.) I may be returning this.  The ad (and the box) says it is waterproof for up to 48 hours and it says it is good for digital media.  So far, the only credentials I can find on it is a UL 350 / 1700 sticker.  That takes care of fire for paper only.  It needs to have an additional certification, either ETL or UL class 125 for digital proper interior temperature to actually be usable for digital media.  It needs something else for water testing.  When I called Honeywell, they seemed to be intentionally vague about it, never saying what certification it had.  I have emailed the manufacturer to get the certification numbers.  If legit, that should be no problem.  If it doesn't have them, then the claim is based on design and not independent testing.  That would be useless.

R33BZGP7Y2EIFP,"As a person without private transportation, it's really hard to shop without a cart. I searched everywhere I could think of to find a cart in a brick-and-mortar store, but when I couldn't, I looked at Amazon. This cart seemed to be a good price and didn't have the *worst* reviews, so I went ahead an ordered it.When the cart showed up, it was clearly damaged. The metal was bent and the basket had been assembled improperly. I had to switch around the way the basket was installed so that the wheels would install properly. (The way it was assembled, both sets of wheels would have been on the same side!) To make matters worse, due to the way the metal was bent, I couldn't install the wheels correctly -- there was no way to get the pin on the other side of the bar.Once assembled, I was worried about its ability to actually hold anything. So I took it on a test run to the grocery store a few blocks from us. It's supposed to be able to carry 50 pounds? Nope. The axle snapped on the way back and the entire cart collapsed. The fun part was carrying all of my groceries the last block.I imagine that even if my cart hadn't arrived in such poor shape that it would have still been awful.

R1PA9XICI90LKH,"I really wanted to love these pens as I have read a lot of really good reviews for them. However, they didn't work for me. My natural pen holding position has the pen slanted at about a 45-degree angle - it's not super slanted, but it's not very upright either. As a result, the pen nib sort of scratched along the paper. It still worked, but it didn't feel smooth at all and the sound of the scratching was really annoying. I tried writing with the pen a bit more upright and it did flow really nicely and didn't scratch, but it felt very unnatural for me.It is such a shame because the inks in these pens are really unique and fun. Each pen has black ink that is tinged with a different color. The purple-black and green-black were my favorites, and I just so wished they would have worked with my grip. This is a really unique idea and I've not seen it with any other brands of pen.If you have a more upright pen grip, I would highly recommend these. If you are more slanted, these might not be the best choice.",0,0

R3U56JOXFZOXPB,"I rarely write reviews, but this unit does not do what it says it does, and I'd like to save another potential buyer from going through what I did. If all you want to do is scan and organize papers, I think that this unit would be FABULOUS once you get it installed and start using it (this is not a quick or easy task). However, IF YOUR GOAL IS TO EXPORT, I would not buy this unit. Since that is my purpose, I'm returning it.I bought this with the intent of scanning charge receipts from my business and exporting them into Quickbooks. The box and information say that Neat will do this. I hate this task, and I thought the money would be well worth the time savings.Installation: The box comes with version 4 of the software. However, version 5 is out, so you are directed to the internet to obtain it as prior problems have supposedly been fixed. Their website is slow, freezes, and often links you to a non-functioning page. After multiple tries, I was able to download the software. It directs you to disable any internet firewalls or anti-virus software. Seems easy, but Firefox didn't have a pull down menu for this. Had to go to help and finally found out how to do this. (The time required for this was my ignorance and not Neat's, however, the same might be true of others as well).Usual policy to close all other programs during installation of a new program was followed. Finally ready to install, and it freezes and crashes my computer (Windows XP) and my wireless mouse multiple times. I had to endure many restarts of my computer (most had to be without proper shutdown and by using the on/off switch on my computer), and unplugging and plugging the USB connection to the computer for the wireless mouse. Three hours later, it finally installed.Starting: I'm pretty intuitive and usually start using a program and exploring menus without a problem. However, menus are not intuitive until you read the directions. Again, this is more time invested. Once reading the directions, I have to admit it was no problem using the machine, but it was cumbersome. The first thing is that although the scanning is pretty quick, it takes a while for the software to convert the data into a viewable receipt. Perhaps the best thing is to scan in a bunch of receipts, then go do something else while it works and come back later. I wanted to see if it exported properly before I invested a lot of time scanning. If you do have to go away and do something else while it is processing the scans, it takes away from the time saving purpose of using Neat.The next problem is each time you export a receipt, you have to drill down to tell Neat where you want it to export. This involves many clicks from My Computer, All users, shared documents, documents and settings, shared documents, Quickbooks, Company, etc. You can't set any or preferable locations. Then, you have to choose the account from Neat software to the account in QB's each time. Takes a lot of time. Batching the exports is definitely the way to go to make things efficient, but still not as much of a time saver as I thought it would be, especially when you have to keep selecting the accounts in QB's.Practical use: This is where the Neat fails miserably. I have an account in Quickbooks where all the charge receipts go. They are listed with the vendor, date purchased, and the account that they go into e.g. office supplies, hardware, software, etc. When Neat exports them, it exports them as bills to pay so are under accounts payable and not in the Charge Register under the account that I selected. To get that information, you have to then go to accounts payable. Therefore it is an extra step to go to accounts payable to see the detail to make sure it was correct as well as to look at it for analysis on another occasion. Although that's not the way I record I QB's, I could live with that if it meant that I didn't have to enter all those receipts.  Another problem was that it wouldn't export credit card refunds.  It said it would not import because the amount was under $10!!  It seems absurd not to be able to export credits.  I didn't try to import and charges under $10 so I don't know what it would do there.However, the final thing that killed the deal was that the exported items all come in with the date exported, and not the date of purchase. I tried several different things, checked online forums, help, but there wasn't anything about correcting this. There is no live help; help and customer service are only available by email. I got an email back that says they will get to me when they can. Given that, I went through all the menus, help info, and user forums. My conclusion was that there appears to be no fix for that. If I have to go into each receipt to fix the date, I might as well just enter them.Conclusion: The problems using this to export to Quickbooks make is such that it just doesn't do the job. There are multiple steps to define the program to export to each time, define the account to go to each time, then go to accounts payable to view the details of the export, and then to change the date on the transaction. In addition you have to enter any refunds or credits manually and not through Neat as it won't export them.  This kills the whole idea to create efficiency and save time.",0,0

R2D1FI6N3HQ793,"My experience so far with this fire safe is so-so.  I too immediately noticed the cheap locking mechanisms that other reviews have documented.  The two clasps on either side of the safe are a cheap plastic, that clamp down with the aid of a cheap plastic spring that (on the right side) was bent upon delivery.  Clamping down those handles is still doable with some finagling.The safe was ""locked"" on delivery, but the latch that locks the chest was not in the slot it was supposed to be in that would keep it secure.  Instead, it's as though the key put the safe's latch in the ""locked"" position while it was fully open, then downward pressure from the chest's lid drove the locking latch into the plastic of the lid, putting a nice dent in the lid.  The result is that the chest will not securely lock.For my purposes, the safe doesn't have to lock, and it accomplishes what I need it to, so I'm keeping the safe, lesson learned: You get what you pay for.",0,0

R2EM0QN9II27ZT,"It's a great scanner, but this listing says it does  ""medium-format slides is supported as well"" and it doesn't.  The light in the lid is not wide enough to do full highth medium slides or film and the software has no previsions to do anything other than 35mm film.  I was very disapointed.  The only way to do 120 medium format is to move the negitave around and make several scans and stich it together in a program like photoshop.  The biggest pain is that it will not let you set anything other than 35mm for film and it breaks up the scans to that size only for film or slides.  It wouldn't be so bad if it let you set the length of the slide.  Canon screwed up big time on their software with this as it's too restrictive and will not let you set any user defined size on film.  This scanner could have been great for 120, 8mm, or 16mm or 110 film strips, but it's not.  It is a great scanner other wise.  One other reviewer said it worked great on his 120 slides, but I don't see how as there is no setting for this and it has to cut the slides scanned area short.

R35BWJWR3ADCBR,"Using this device, I've eliminated two large file cabinets from my office by storing everything digitally. I scan each document as a pdf and file it according to my own system. You can use NEAT's filing system, but I chose to override it to keep things simple.  Be aware that NEAT has a monopoly on the alcohol-saturated cleaning sheets that you'll need occasionally. With shipping, it'll cost you about $15 for just three of them.  They are not sold in stores.  UPDATE: I have lowered my rating from four stars to one because the unit no longer works properly and NEAT technical support -- after two dozen time-wasting interactions tied to the same case number -- cannot tell me why. The software crashes most of the time these days, which can be very annoying when you've scanned a ten-page document and are hoping not to generate the all-too-frequent message ""NEAT has stopped working...""  Under the circumstances, the problems I cited in my earlier, much more favorable review, are seeming less tolerable.  Read the despairing comments on NEAT's filing software and you'll see that this has been a major issue for the product.  I avoided the problem simply because (as I mentioned above) I scanned everything as a pdf and filed it manually. NEAT took a lot of heat for updating the software in a way that widowed scans done with earlier versions.",0,0
R2W9M9V5R5ZA8E,"Update 1/16/17: I was offered a refund for my purchase of ink if I agreed to update or remove the 2-star review that I had given. At no time, was it specified that the update must be positive. I’m changing my rating from 2 stars to 1 star, as since my first review, my printer has become non-operational. Initially I was able to print fine if I only needed to print in black ink. After several attempts with head cleanings, printer alignments etc., my printer will not even print in black, nor color. I now own an expensive paperweight. So, this ink may work for some, or it may not.Original review: I used these cartridges in an HP 8600 Office Jet Plus.  If you only need to print in black all the time then these refills would receive 5 stars.However, the black cartridge does something to mess up my color printing.  I first tried the Fuzoo black with genuine HP color cartridges that were already installed.  Colors were muddy and nowhere near to true.  I then tried replacing the HP cartridges with the color Fuzoo to use together with the Fuzoo black cartridge, same deal, no improvement.  I even opened and tried the 2nd black cartridge they sent thinking maybe the first was defective.  Color printing still would not work correctly.  I really wanted to like these cartridges since the price is beyond reasonable, but the way it messes up the color printing is unacceptable.I also tried cleaning the print heads and aligning the print heads several times.  Neither action worked and the aligning actually failed. Included in my review is a picture of images printed with the Fuzoo ink cartridges (left) and HP cartridges (right).",0,0

The pocket chart itself is very nice. I almost wanted to keep it because I truly like the pocket chart. However, the packaging for the cards has obviously gotten wet/moisture somewhere that resulted in the mold that ha formed. It is NOT production dust as the company claims. The cards are all stuck together. When you separate them, the paper peels leaving the obvious signs of water damage when you try to separate paper that has dried on top of each other. If this wasn't the case, it would be an amazing calendar. Even after trying to clean them off, the residue and damage done to the cards is still evident. Sadly, I will have to return it.

R2JWJZINEOWZ4O,"Based on reviews and photos, the description and the price, I was hesitant to buy the product and I should have listened to my gut feeling.1) The product is made almost entirely out of plastic and is so flimsy that I am afraid a strong wind will blow it over and tip my laptop off the stand.2) The height is somewhat adjustable, but not above 20 inches.  So, if you are a tall person or sit somewhere where the height is above 20 inches, then you will be sitting in a hunched position.3) The mouse pad is just big enough for the mouse, not the mouse and my hand, just the mouse.  So, if you plan on spending a lot of time on this, then best to not use it anything more than a coaster.  But seeing how flimsy it is, if you put a drink on it, best be careful that you don't breathe too hard near the table (seriously).4) Overall, I would give it 1.5 stars at best.",0,0

Cheap cheap cheap. the plastic legs were bending when they weren't supposed to. the laptop stand only supports one side of the laptop due to its one peg on the right underside. other than that this thing still wast worth the money... there were scratches all over the plastic. the ""mouse pad"" isn't aligned correctly, so it has a gap closer to you, and on the other end of the ""mouse pad"" it is pushed upwards, creating a mini mountain, which is rather irritating if you move your hands a lot on the mouse pad... and on the actual stand for the laptop there were scratches, plastic pieces around, and dents...  also where the legs are supposed to stay underneath, whilst not in use, by clips, one was missing. so if all this will pass your criteria for purchasing, then by all means do so, but for me, its getting returned ASAP.

R12JXD4O0QERR7,"I would highly deter anyone from purchasing this product! (I would give it zero stars if I could)I own all three NEAT products and can say that the hardware is OK...it is their software and non-existing customer support that makes this product unusable.Here is a link to Consumer Affairs regarding the Neat scanners:  www.consumeraffairs.com/document-scanners/neat.html  (63% gave it 1 star!)The list of problems I have had with this product is long, but here are the top complaints:-There is NO customer service. If you would like customer service you have to pay for it (after the initial purchase window) and their hours are only EST. I have owned my scanner since they first came out so I am grandfathered in for ""free"" customer support; even with that the last time I tried to reach a live voice it took a month of emailing back and forth first. On average every customer support session (when I finally reach a live person) has taken a minimum of 4-6 hours. Their cloud corrupted our companies files and it took a solid week to fix all of the computers.-Their cloud service is a joke. (Oh, and you have to pay monthly to use this service on top of purchasing the hardware and buying customer support!) I understand that if one has many .pdf files to upload to the cloud it takes time, yet Dropbox, Google Drive, Box, SugarSync, etc have figured it out...Neat has not. Their software is poorly written and slow.-Beyond the sync function if one simply tries to move folders, delete documents, or import/export files (No internet involved) it can take a day of waiting while it slowly processes and the program often shuts down.-One of the features that they claim as a high selling point is their search capabilities. I use this when putting in our companies receipts. In the notes portion I will place a tag so that I can easily search later on. Nowhere in their software do they have spell check, so if i accidentally misspell a tag then that search no longer is valid. Who, in this day and age does not have spell check in every dialog box?!The bottom line is that the software and its programming do not keep up with the technology that it uses. The Neat Co. then follows that up by providing little to no customer support...not a winning combination.We have now switched over to the Fujitsu ScanSnap ix500 it is a little more expensive but well worth it. In the end you will save money and a whole lot of time.",0,0

R2G7F5GH61BBEI,"We've been using Dymo label printers in our business for several years to print address labels. However, their software just would not work on a new Windows Terminal Server which all our users assess through thin clients. This Brother network printer seemed like it would do the job.The printer itself worked fine and the software did install on the Terminal Server. But, the software was a big disappointment (C- to D+ rating). Entering addresses was so much poorer compared to the Dymo that our users didn't like it at all.On the other hand, the Dymo application is an A+ rating. It even has a built-in address checker. With one click it runs the address through a UPSP database to verify the address, automatically make changes,  and generate a PostNet bar code. For instance, you can just type in the street address and a 5 digit zip code. The address checker automatically fills in the city, state and 9 digit zip code. Our users love it.So, back to the drawing board. Checking Dymo's web site and talking to their customer service confirmed that their software was not designed to work on Terminal Server. But, I kept at it. I finally got the software to work on TS and now our users are happy. (The Brother printer is back in its box on a shelf.)Tip on Dymo install on Terminal Server:Dymo software requires MS .Net Framework 3.51.Physiclly connect Dyno printer to server when installing software to also install driver.After software and driver installation, you can move printers to other locations.",0,0
R3C5FCJB0FZHIX,"This product is very simple in design, and consists of three pieces. It is made of metal and labelled 'Made in China'. The tubular frame is in two parts; the third piece being the actual footrest. As to the frame - the ends of the U shaped handle are fluted and designed to drop straight into the top of the lower frame tubes. The handle part of the frame is pierced with six pairs of holes, into which the footrest hooks. When assembled the unit is quite rigid and sturdy, but is heavy and quite difficult to move or reposition with one's foot. There is no method of securing the upper and lower frame halves together, and lifting the unit by the handle can allow the lower frame to fall away from the handle section, which could present a hazard.

R27CB429LFYTVM,"I'm disappointed in these screen protectors; part of the problem is the protectors themselves and part of the problem is Amazon.In my research, I've found there are two distinct types of screen protectors.  One type is a hard film with an adhesive backing.  When I've purchased these in the past (for other phones), the protector came with both a front and back layer to peel off; the front layer was rigid and the back layer protected the adhesive.  To apply, you peel off the back layer; the rigid front layer makes it easy to apply onto the phone.  You then peel off the front rigid layer and you are left simply with the protector covering the phone's screen.  This is the type of protector I wanted to purchase.The second kind of protector is a much softer plastic, almost like a vinyl.  There is no adhesive on this protector; the vinyl simply adheres to the screen.  This type tends to be harder to apply since there is nothing rigid to hold it straight while you are applying it.  I did not want to purchase this type of protector.  They are much harder to apply and they get many more bubbles underneath than the first type of protector.Reading the description of the protector and the other Amazon reviews, I was led to believe I would be purchasing the first type.  Unfortunately, due to the marketplace vendor I chose, I received the second type.This happens because the product listing is so broad (LCD screen protectors for Blackberry) that 3rd party vendors can really sell whatever type they choose under this listing.  I partially blame Amazon for this; they really should have more specific listing categories so customers know what they are getting.Now, for the price, it's hard to complain, and it is indeed a screen protector, but it's unfortunate that you really don't know what you are going to get.",0,0

R2JDIDI9JK0RHS,"I reviewed a few items for storing important documents (passport, org birth cert, legal documents). I settled on this because it has one of the higher fireproof standards as well as waterproof without being a safe or file cabinet. I felt both features were important. In that regard this fits the requirements .  I read the dimensions and weight, it is a hefty 45 pounds but I wouldn't want someone to be able to easily walk-off with this case; but you must be able to deal with the weight as the owner.STORAGE: as I indicated in the title, my main issue is with the bulk/size of the case.  The case height is 7-1/4"". Unfortunately, it doesn't fit under my bed (which was where I was going to store this). YOU CANNOT STAND THIS VERTICALLY or you negate the capability and/or effectiveness of the case - it must lay flat. At 19""W and 16""L  and 7.25""H - it takes up a lot of room. Be prepared for that.AIRED-OUT: It is adamantly recommended that monthly, the case is opened and aired-out, to prevent mold from occurring. For some that may not be an issue, but for others, wherever you store this, that may be problematic. I have purchased silica gel packets to put in the case and hopefully those will help. For those who want to store documents and forget it; that is not possible.KEYS: This case is locked with keys (not a code). You must maintain the keys and know their ID number if you lose them. If a fire occurred (tragic) and the box survived and you didn't have the keys, you could probably break into the case using other implements but you should probably have a key stored off-premises.In the end, I believe the case would protect the documents enclosed, which is the point, but ability to move this case, access for airing-out and storage are also important to consider.",0,0

R356UAS7ZOUW1B,"EMAIL SERVER SETUP is not working after spending countless hours with my ISP and Epson technical support on the phone. I bought htis printer because it had 5 stars. Everywhere I found awesome reviews. It was a pretty straightforward process to set up EXCEPT when it came to setting up the Email Server which is in Advanced Settings.  You SHOULD be able to set up any pop3 email account as your email server and scan and email. I tried 3 different accounts, gmail; outlook; frontier, and none of the accounts worked. I have an older lexmark that i set up using the same accounts and it worked beautifully. Why is it so difficult to set up on this printer? I called EPSON three times, 1st time the tech who was clueless said i have to call my ISP and have them enable udp/tcp and enable 3 different port numbers. When I called my ISP, (FRONTIER), they said thats ludicrous. So they wanted to help me but Frontier passed me along to 4 other departments but noone knew what to do, so after 2 hours of that I gave up. I called up EPSON technical support again, and the 2nd time they made me hold 25 minutes and then they hung up and the 3rd time they made me hold 40 minutes and they picked up the phone at 10:59 est. and said not in a recorded voice but a live voice, we are closed now, call back in the morning!!

ROUJXR1UAD4LG,"I don't usually leave reviews but when service is just deceitful in failing to fix a defective product, well then i can make time to warn others.The ""Premium Therapeutic Grade Foot Rest Cushion"" was defective, admittedly by someone via the single reply email i received after i had emailed the support address in question. The Foam inside was cut incorrectly which made the cushion (1) shorter then advertised (2) having a gap between the two sides, since it folds in half.I attempted to look past this but since the whole point of this is comfort, it didn't hold merit to the point of displeasure when trying to ""ignore"" these issues. Normally this is a.. well, you ""get what you pay for"" type of situation, but lets be real, this is a $40 foam block.. so no, i need this replaced with one that is advertised.Ok, no problem... ill contact the company and hopefully they will help me out.I emailed the support address ""support@deskjockey.net"" and attached the same 3 pictures i included here and this was the (only) email i received..""Good Afternoon,Wow! That product is obviously defective. Thank you so much for reaching out to let us know and sending such great photos. We really appreciate it.I will send a replacement ASAP to your address with expedited shipping.Thank you so much for your patience,Maggie,Desk Jockey Support Team""Great! Even ""expedited shipping."" Fantastic right?I replied with an appreciated note about this help and looking forward to the replacement product.3 Weeks later, i had received nothing. So, i emailed the support address again curious as to a timeline or any indication on when the replacement would be sent out, and while i do have patience.. this was 3 weeks later and nothing had been sent or emailed.

R3JOVSURJW1QCM,"I was really excited about this machine, but it leaked from the very first day. The hose attachment for the sink was missing, so we had to go to the hardware store to get a hose and connectors just to try the thing, only for it to leak on the floor. This machine doesn't drain fully on its own, even with the pump that the 17lb capacity machine has, so you have to put a pan or bucket low enough and tip it after use to try to get the rest of the water out of the hose and basin under the agitating tub (or take it outside to drain), the plumbing underneath this thing is glued together cheap plastic so there's no real way to repair it when it leaks, and the seller is third party from china, so if you have a problem, forget about a refund or sending it back - it's just not going to happen. So after going back and forth with the seller and Amazon for weeks, you'll just end up eating the wasted money like we did and then wonder what to do with this low quality machine and your deep disappointment. I know the reviews look mostly good on here (that's why I bought this thing!) but please!! Save yourself a lot of money, time, energy, and frustration and buy a notable brand like black and decker or something that you can send back stateside or get some actual help with, because if you get a faulty one of these, you'll have more problems than you started with. I usually make good purchases after doing a lot of research and very rarely have regrets - I spent months deliberating and agonizing over which one of these to get - and I don't think I've ever had worse buyer's remorse.

RPTIO7YO4HG3H,"I have purchased re-manufactured ink toner cartridges many times in the past with no problems.  I print a few pages regularly - anywhere from maybe 10 to 30 pages a week.  I used this item regularly - and it seems to have stopped working even though my printer showed that my black ink cartridge was over 1/2 full.  It was printing so poorly that I couldn't even read the pages (it was very light and spotty).  I took it out and replaced it, did all the trouble shooting the printer offered, and tried it again - and it still didn't work.  (It also still read as being over 1/2 full - my printer always gives warnings when the ink is running low - and it was not low with this cartridge).  Besides not getting what I paid for, I also wasted a lot of time and  paper in the process of trying to get it to work.  The color ink seems to be okay so far.  I don't believe it dried up from not being used, as I do print on a regular basis - and the color ink still works (I print with both color and black regularly).This has soured me from buying re-manufactured in toner.  I really want to do what is best for the environment and, of course, save $$ - but I can't justify only getting 1/2 the printing when I am paying for the XL.  The problem was definitely not my printer - as i went out and bought the HP brand and now it's printing perfectly.  The only reason I am not giving one star is because it did print fine for a little while.",0,0

You can find free, generic scanning software that is more reliable and much less hassle.First of all, you must create an account with them to even get the software that you need, for the product you just paid $100+ for.During the install process (version 5.5), you have to sign up for their awful cloud service, which btw can take sometime 4-5 hours for your uploads to appear, and must fill out a questionnaire and provide your phone number.  This is just to INSTALL the software.  If you don't want to try their cloud service then you cannot complete installation.

The black cartridge did not seat properly in the holder on the printer but with a bit of manipulation I managed to get it seated well enough to work although it pops out occasionally and has to be manipulated again.

R320N4W3A6XHRK,"Simply awful product, it is difficult to cut with anything other than scissors. It will not tear worth a damn as it is aluded to on the packaging and don't even try a razor blade as it masticates the edges of the material. The ""perforations"" for easy ""tearing"" are just holes in the film you bought to block out the light that in fact allows light to permeate it. The ""static cling"" is more luck than magic.The 24"" wide roll is actually 23 1/2 inches and patching the pieces together looks awful. Don't even bother with this unless you have large flat non segmented windows. Any odd shapes, lengths or detail is a nightmare. If you don't want light to permeate the edges of the windows you have to overlap the edges of the window frames with the film rather than cutting it to the exact dimansions of the window. However doing this is both unattractive and prevents the product from properly clinging to the window. Also it may interfere with the movement and functioning of your windows. So rather than having an easy to take up and down static cling you have to tape the edges down and over lay them on the frames making your windows look like a kindergarden art project went horribly wrong and be semipermanent fixture.The material itself is very light weight and brittle so holes and cuts and rips happen quite easily. It took my wife and I three hours to cover three windows in this garbage and our windows only had two segments each. The only reason this gets two stars is it does block out a significant proportion of the light coming through the windows but at what cost?We wanted a temporary solution to cover the windows when we had shift work and to be taken down when we would like to use our windows. The only quality solution to this dilemma is blackout track blinds, but they are exceptionally expensive and have to be custom cut to each window. This seemed like the way to go, however now our windows are a mess and I don't ever want to go through trying to get them placed again even though they are cut. I will leave them up for now until I find a better solution but this is going in the trash at the earliest opportunity. Do not waste your money, before the next person makes this $50 mistake this horrible product should end up on the scrap heap of history.",0,0
R1UO9T9NFDDK2S,"On the plus side, when my scanner died a little AFTER the warranty ran out, the company sent me a new one very quickly, and paid all shipping to and from (for the return of the old one). They were very helpful. That's why this gets an extra star.But the quality of the scans with this is very bad, and the character recognition is almost non-existent. I just ran 10 receipts thru, of varying quality, and only ONE picked up the correct merchant name and transaction amount. Some just showed blank, and others had random stuff it picked up. None of the receipts were faded or illegible - I scanned a few into Evernote with my android phone and it picked them up, the OCR worked fine.I knew this wasn't a top of the line model when I bought it, but I was trying to save a bit. Bad move in this case. Maybe their larger models are better quality, but I think I'll save up and try one of the Fujitsu ScanSnap models next time.

R1BCY8A45RW5MJ,"There is still a great deal of manual entry required.  The software, essentially, cannot read handwritten amounts.  Even if it's a machine-printed amount, it may not find the correct amount on the receipt.  It may, or may not, find the name of the issuer of the receipt.  In short, the user has to review EVERYTHING for accuracy, and do a lot of manual entry besides.  Furthermore, the ""upgrade"", I'd call it a ""sidegrade"", to version 5.1 is a hassle.  The new version of the software cannot directly read the previous backup file format (.nwbak), requiring a special migration process.  I have run the migration utility  more than once, and it still has not migrated my data saved in the older version. I am waiting for one of their technicians to tell me how I can get the data into the new version.  In the end, I may have to re-scan all the receipts into the new version, or go back to the previous version.Once the data is entered accurately, it can run handy reports easily.

R2M0KTM7PTVS8B,"Updated April 22, 2016I saw a review of a related item with the samt idiotic wheel assembly.  There was mention of 2 cotter pins shipped with the equipment.  With my cart, I received ONE cotter pin and 4 bending bolts for the front and back wheels.  And, on my older Trimmer cart, I DID receive 2 cotter pins.  I tried those, and they DID NOT WORK.  The ends of the cotter pins are too small to be reliable held in place.  I would STRONGLY suggest the manufacturer come up with a RELIABLE way to keep the back wheels in place, because I love these carts, and I don't want to have to provide engineering instructions in my refiews (I have bought a replacement for this cart from Overstock, because I want replacements for the PARTS THAT WENT FLYING AROUND THE NEIGHBORHOOD.  Then, I am going to fashion RELIABLE back-wheel retainers out of jumbo paper clips.  Probably a D-shaped arrangement.  I am confident that THOSE won't come off and leave me with a bunch of springs all over the block.  Why can't these people use a Jesus clip or something?Update April 16, 2016.  I have to do this.I have had to reduce my review to ONE START in the hope that the MANUFACTURER WILL READ IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!WHEEL FASTENERSWHEEL FASTENERSWHEEL FASTENERSWHEEL FASTENERSWHEEL FASTENERS\Do I have to say it again? FIX THE WHEEL FASTENER DESIGN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!A back wheel of my just-purchased EXTRA-LARGE shopping cart fell off, and of course, parts went flying all over the neighborhood.  Get it?  Got it?At least they had the sense to cap the bending bolts on the FRONT WHEELS, and on my own normal-sized one, I duplicated that by shoving balls of electrical tape into the tubes by the front wheels.I'm debating whether to pick up a new extra-large for the spare parts or go to the hardware store to buy some sprigs, washers, and heavy steel wire and keep the old one.  By rights, they should send me a replacement WITHOUT requiring me to ship this heavy thing back.  Unless somebody WRITES ME FROM THE COMPANY and offers me some kind of solace, I will NOT restore the 5-star review.tHE least they could do IS HAVE A PLACE WHERE i CAN order replacement parts!Putting a ""bending bolt"" at the most vulnerable place on a wheel/axle assembly always struck me as the dumbest idea I've ever seen.  I've done my best to compensate for this stupid mistake; I would appreciate it if the manufacturer would meet me half-way.  They need MORE STABLE AND CERTAIN fasteners on the BACK WHEELS.Update March 8, 2016My wife has passed away, and I am now involved with a lady who lives about 3/4 mile from my house.  The ""large"" shopping cart is rated at I believe 50 pounds, so i bought the extra-large, which is rated at 96 pounds.  I assembled it today, and it still has those weird ""bending bolts"" for the back wheels.  I bent the ends on the back wheels as described below, but i really wish the manufacturer of this product would come up with a better way to hold those back wheels in place!  It's going to be interesting to see how this thing holds together when I take 50 lb. of cat litter over there.  I'll keep you posted.I cannot drive, and so I have had many a shopping cart.  In the old days, I used a really common two-wheeler that squealed like a banshee - these were all over the place!  I got a 4-wheeler from my mother-in-law, who got it from a garage sale, and last week, the last bottom rod fell off; the other rods were Jerry-rigged with wire, and I didn't feel like taking the trouble to fix it again.  I will keep that one for a spare.Assembly: It took a long time to assemble this, because I managed to rip the instructions in half while unpacking it.  But once I figured things out, the assembly went perfectly.  I did decide to do a couple things other people may not have done: When I put the large wheels on, I put the bending bolt through both the wheel and the cap.  Then, I squeezed the open end of the bending bolt together with pliers.  Finally, I bent the straight end of the bending bolt up against the groove in the cap.  Now, I know it's never going to come apart.Usage: In the store, the handle is about the same height as a grocery cart, so it's easy to walk it around.  I got the cart liner, and so I never use bags unless I know there will be leakage from something (such as raw meat.)I drag my shopping carts around a lot, sometimes for miles.  When dragging this one behind on the large wheels, I find it balances much more nicely than the others I have had.  It's also almost silent, and has a very smooth feel when dragging!  If the sidewalk is smooth, it's very comfortable to walk this cart on 4 wheels, although I never recommend this for any cart over long distances.I might have taken a star off for assembly issues, but they really didn't bother me.  All in all, I'm very happy with this product.",0,0

I have a Canon Pixma MX922. The cartridges are not a good fit. The quality of the cartridge itself was a problem as 2 of them broke after inserting them ( and I did insert them properly!) another huge problem was although I unwrapped them carefully and held them upside down so the area the ink actually comes out from was on top,while I took off the large plastic tab the ink still went everywhere.

It’s been sitting in a drawer for several months and I got it back out to finally try to really figure out what I could be doing wrong, and I think it’s just a defective product. As you can see in my picture, I’ve wasted several tags trying to get it to work. It pushes the whole row of tags out and gets jammed very easily.

R3BG1PHGF5MW69,"This is the second time I purchased this product.  The first time I did, I experienced streaking with the Cyan cartridge.  Nevertheless, I decided to give the vendor the benefit of the doubt because it still seemed like a good deal and I could tolerate the occasional streaks.  So, I purchased another 4-pack and I am now experiencing severe smudging with the Magenta toner on all prints.  At this point, purchasing this product is like playing a game of roulette with a sure bet of losing; it's just a matter of which color you want to place your bets on.UPDATE: I'm increasing my original rating from 2 stars to 4 to reflect good service. The vendor contacted me shortly after this review and offered a full 4-toner replacement st no charge.  They were very responsive throughout the process and checked back frequently to make sure I received and tested the product.  So far, the Magenta replacement is functioning as it should be.  I will update my review again once I make it through all four cartridges.UPDATE 10/16/2017--reduced rating to two stars:  So, I finally went through the remaining toner cartridges from the initial shipment, as well as the replacement, and the final verdict is that I will never purchase these again.  I have experienced issues with every cartridge I loaded.  The black toner seems to be the safest bet, but even those don't operate to the full 2500 page capacity based on printer stats.  I experienced streaking, smudges, and premature toner outages with all color cartridges.  The Yellow toner created light smudges along the left edge of all pages during its entire lifetime--including on BW prints; Blue toners always streaked, spotted, smudged, and seemed to run out the quickest; and the last new Magenta toner I loaded today registered only as half full.  My original review stands; it really is hit or miss, with most missing the mark.  2 stars, for at least, having decent customer service.",0,0

R1BF8M551PMKYQ,"Bought this because of the sterling reviews about the OCR and document utility software.  Got it, plugged everything in, and it simply does not do anything except the most basic of scanning with my Mac.

In addition, there is no way to calibrate the scanning function (and it needed it) since even the driver interface is different than the one described in the manual, although tech support said they might have a patch.Box is completely misleading  - reading it, you would think that if you have OS X you are good to go.

R2JUXNNLW1489A,"Granted, I ordered this cartridge over a year ago (May 2011 from the vendor JAMinnovations) for my HP Deskjet 845C and just now needed to install it.  The cartridge that was in my deskjet (purchased by the way from inkjetcartridges dot com) lasted over a year - printing about 12-20 pages per week.  It finally went dry, so I installed this one - figuring since it was a genuine HP cartridge in retail packaging (which it wasn't - it was a white box, busted open, with instructions stuck on the outside) that it would work great.  But maybe if it really was an original HP product, since they probably don't make these for this older printer, it was dried up long ago.  Anyway, I immediately ordered another cartridge from Amazon (OfficeMax Black Ink Cartridge Compatible with HP 15 (C6615DN) OM98673 Sold by Speedy Inks, $8.99).  It arrived today, I installed it & it works great!  It was packaged very well, is fresh, isn't an ""original"" HP cartridge, but I don't think that matters for these older printers.

R1T2FUR3KEMEVY,"Now that the device is out of warranty, I'm having nothing but problems. At first, it would go offline for hours at a time, even though my internet was working on all my other devices. About 2 weeks ago it stopped working all together, except for a few hours yesterday. I was on the phone (my cell) with custormer service last week for almost an hour before being transferred to someone who supposedly has more technical expertise. I was with the tech person for over an hour. They both had me trying the same things over and over again. I did tell them that I had already tried those things with no success. The tech person finally told me that the problem was in the device itself and that I needed to purchase another one. These days most electronics last for years. If this product has to be replaced every 1 or 2 years it must mean quality was not a concern when it was designed. I now have to decide if I want to fork out the money for another one and spend time searching for a price I can afford. My advice to anyone considering buying - it's good while it lasts, but that might be for a short time.UPDATE. I sent my Ooma phone number as instructed when the company replied to my review. I was supposed to be connected to Support. They have my email address. No one has contacted me.

To clear it, you have to remove the top (there is a screw in the back) and turn the machin upside down.

The XL black ink cartridge didn't last half as long as just a standard HP cartridge, but that I can live with due to the price being much lower than authentic cartridges. When it came time for me to use the color cartridge it was around a year later, and I had kept it sealed in the box that it came in. After printing a few things, I realized that the blue ink in the cartridge didn't seem to be working.

R2UJB7LC6FXY0D,"Sad that Amazon insists on combining reviews for unrelated products.  This review is for the one with the built-in gel wrist wrest MW85B.I have the matching wrist rest WR85B, so I thought I'd get this one.  The wrist wrest is OK.  This mouse pad is, however, garbage!For starters, it is not even close to being flat.  It is warped/dished, and the corners raise off my desk 1/8"" to 1/4"".  So, as you move the mouse around, it is flopping around as well.  This is a deal breaker for me.  I tried to flatten it out with no improvement whatsoever.Next, it is really too small.  Like the wrist wrest, the gel is quite hard, and, therefore, it's best to use it as a PALM rest.  Either way, it is too short.  From where your wrist wrests, the mouse goes off the top of the pad often.  Width-wise, it is OK.  Not generous, but OK.Additionally, it is a very scratchy/rough material for the mouse surface.  It feels like you are almost dragging your mouse on sandpaper.  It does not move easily, and, considering I am using a very expensive/precious Logitech MX Revolution mouse, I don't want it wearing the pads off.Finally, sort of a con, but these are not the ""satin pillow"" that 3M describes, but rather a firm (almost no give) gel/rubber with a matte soft-touch vinyl cover much like you might see on some automotive surfaces.In sum, the wrist wrest is OK, but the mouse pad version is terrible.",0,0

So, I paid around $2.00 a card, same price as if bought individually in a store, with more selection.",0,0

Okay, great... now, for the real test. I did a printer head cleaning, ran a test page. Not great, didn’t look like it was giving me any ink from the gray and black tanks I had replaced. Next, tried printing return labels (regular paper, bar code label printing like we used to have to do for Amazon returns) for stuff I needed to send out. Major fail—the bar codes were missing data, the print quality was crap. I tried repeating with color vs b/w, no improvement. Wasted a lot of OEM color ink trying to troubleshoot this mess. Finally realized that the one-star reviews had it right; I’m not a high end user, wasn’t trying to print photo quality or anything. Just wanted to print a darned shipping return label or three.

R2Y3QINAHJD5JN,"Review menu iconThe WORST service for businessesjust nowIf you need or expect service that works reliably and dependably, this is not the company for you.  I own several franchises and this was the biggest mistake I’ve made since going in business.  They complete about 1 in 4 calls successfully and have no way to open a ticket with a technical team to resolve the issue.  It has cost me so much in lost revenue and they are a complete nightmare to deal with.  No desire to even have a person support and resolve the issue.  Try to open a trouble ticket before ordering the service, you’ll see what I mean.  Every day there’s a message that says they have an outage and are experiencing technical issues, after sitting on hold and reaching one of the front line people, you’ll get no where, because they just take your name and number, then they will tell you they are escalating, but they don’t.  What will you do when an employee needs to call 911 and the service doesn’t work?  If you are reading this because you are experiencing a similar issue, file a complaint with the fcc.

R1XKL0CDCXBFIS,"I've tried all different brands and sizes of scissors, and carefully followed the extremely easy and simple instructions, and it won't sharpen any of them. And worse (I guess?), if you're not careful when you're pulling your scissors out, you'll cut and damage the cheap plastic on either side of the sharpening area essentially slowly cutting the device in half. I wasn't expecting military-grade for the price but I at least expected it to do the simple task it is advertised as doing. I dislike giving negative reviews and less than 4 or 5 stars, but I've been having a terrible run with products purchased through Amazon lately. Perhaps Amazon should practice a little more quality control with the vendors they allow to sell through their good name and the products those vendors sell. Maybe it's just a Winter curse and things will go back to the old, reliable Amazon that I've relied on and loved for 15+ years. I really wish this device would work for me in some capacity and would sharpen, well, anything, so I could give it 2 or 3 stars; it is what it is though, unfortunately. About the only positive things I have to say, besides the instructions being simple (although to a futile end), is that it was shipped to me quickly and packaged as expected. I don't have any reason to think that the seller was trying to be dishonest or fraudulent, just that an item they sell doesn't work for me. If anyone has any tips or ideas that would help me, although the instructions are foolproof enough, I would love to be proven totally wrong. I guess granny will continue to cut her quilting cloth with dull scissors until I can find a sharpener that will get the job done.",0,0
RI6JRTTRNPC6K,"I purchased this mouse board to replace my Rocket Fish Aluminum dual sided mouse board. I do NOT use this for gaming, it's used for precision mouse function of Design/3D building programs. The Rocket Fish surface coating was becoming worn smooth from several years of use with a Logitech M705 Laser Mouse (my mouse of choice). I'm not one for change, so if I find something I like that works well, I stick with it and re-purchase another one when it's time. I was impressed by the ad presentation and claims of the RUDE-220 so I tried one.Upon receiving the RUDE-220, I couldn't help but notice that the rugged packaging was very well designed with considerable thought, very professional. After opening the package, I discovered that the 'FREE! Teflon Mouse Skates' were missing. Missing Teflon mouse strips aside, I still couldn't wait to try this thing out. The first thing I did was to wipe down the new board with some LCD screen/lens cleaner to remove any residue from the surface.The board is very nicely constructed with a fully bonded, non-skid rubber back over the entire area, not just 4 rubber feet as with similar boards. The mouse surface is completely bonded to the metal core which provides for extreme durability. Noticing that the metal core has been fabricated with radiused edges, gives a nice finished appearance with no sharp edges. I also discovered that this particular board is 'crowned' (curved/bowed) top to bottom, which means that the board does not sit perfectly flat on my desk, with a slight gap on the bottom. Because this 'crown' is so slight, performance of the board should not be affected.After taking the Logitech M705 mouse for a test drive on the new mouse board, I was very disappointed. There was no smooth mouse movement on the 'super slick' surface' as I expected. In fact, I experienced a heavy drag with the mouse on this board. The board's surface feels quite coarse and grainy to the touch, not at all like the 'super slick' surface' that is claimed by the product hype. Based on 35 years plus in the computer field, I feel the performance of this product has left me asking this puzzling question: Exactly what is it that makes this mouse board so special?In conclusion: It's very possible that performance could be enhanced by the 'Teflon Mouse Skates' that were omitted from my package. However, until I can verify this with the proper Teflon strips provided by Rude Gameware (seller), it is only a possible solution at best. Until then, I may be breaking out my old Rocket Fish mouse board, which has a much smoother and slicker surface.UPDATE 12/21/14: I have continued to use the board since posting my review and have found that the mouse surface seems to be getting smoother with use. Although I'm somewhat skeptical about thesurface improvement in such a short period of time, it is now far better than when I first posted results, which was yesterday 12/20/14.I will post further updates on surface performance as necessary.UPDATE 1/2/15: The tracking surface of this board has improved greatly and is now the accurate and smooth surface that I expected it to be. I'm still puzzled as to why the 'break in time' was required to 'smooth out the wrinkles'.Mel",0,0

REVZIKISIO9BA,"The product is okay, half the holes needed to put this thing together were not drilled out. The back doesn't match the rest of the item, the back of the item and the bottoms of the drawers have to be nailed in, but the nails are flimsy and the board is so thick it is borderline impossible to hammer through without injury. In fact,  I ended up using a nail gun. Assembly is unnecessarily difficult, and also doesn't make any sense. For example, why do I have to nail in the bottom composite board to the drawer when you went through the trouble of boring out a track to slide it in on 3 sides of the drawer, but not the back???Then, after all was said and done, AFTER it was assembled, I realized there is a huge scratch on the top. Overall, crappy experience. Sure it's mostly made of real wood, but it was incomplete and nonsensical to assemble. At this point, it's done so I can't even send it back, but if I could, I would.I should have just ordered something from office depot.

R1CGFWPOK0JLR4,"I just got this pen today, and I have to say that i'm not particularly impressed by it. The pen and ink flow is good, but my problem is with the stylus end. They really should have gone with a twist open instead of needing to push down on the stylus to use the pen, because it feels really awkward pushing on the hollow rubber stylus. I imagine the stylus won't last long under the stress of pushing my thumb down on it whenever I need to use the pen. On the other hand, the stylus functions perfectly on my iphone screen.UPDATE: Within 2 weeks of owning this pen and hardly using it, it no longer works. When I click on the pen to open it, it stays stuck and won't go back unless I force it to. Really bad quality and really disappointed. As I said in my original review, the design for this pen is horrible. If you are looking for a stylus pen combo that blows this one away search on Amazon for ""iDream365 stylus pen"", not only does it come with 2 pens and refills, it is cheaper, the design and quality is much better and it takes Parker pen refills.

R2MXDQYI3NVHIV,"Well, Looks like I should of forked out the extra money for the new one, since I have had to get a replacement already! Received it in time but when I hooked it up, no go! The premise is nice, receive a discounted rate for a ""Certified Refurbished"" unit, but only if it WORKS! I would have rather spent the last 2 hours that I have spent on the phone with Ooma customer service, tech support and escalation reps, at the DENTIST or even outside. The money saved is not worth the hassle of what I went through to get one that actually works. Not only was the ethernet cable provided broken, but the port itself is blown. I would like to think that quality assurance would check these units BEFORE they ship and that mine just HAPPENED to miss EVERY quality check, but this sure steers me away from buying another refurb product period.Granted, Ooma is replacing a new unit for this one, so while troubleshooting this with them they did provide a replacement so I did not have to contact the seller, even though I did, but the amount of time spent getting a replacement is not worth it for this customer.  I still have to make a call back to Ooma to get credit for the time I have been unable to use this product when I ACTUALLY get a working one, since you have to sign up BEFORE you activate, so essentially I am in the hole with this purchase.

R1TDEW7L7OC2TE,"I’m getting suspicious of all these Amazon products with “paid reviews”.Here’s a non-paid review. I decided to bite and try the product. Only cause I needed just ONE of these things (versus buying in bulk) and bought based on price.The product is made of extremely thin and cheap plastic. This thing can hold one sheet of paper, max.Because of the thinness of the plastic, it’s not surprising that a high probability of these came broken (for proof, read other reviews). Mine came broken.This thing feels like it was made for 5 cents (if that) and is being sold for $6.62 (at the time I bought it). That’s a HUGE return on such a cheap product.Conclusion? If you just need one like I did, better to go to your in-person box store and just buy one. Sure, you’ll pay about $3 more, but the plastic quality will be better, and you can guarantee yourself you won’t get a broken one.I guess this is part of a new business strategy where you mass produce a cheap product, give some away free to get a bunch of positive reviews to get the internet version of “shelf space” — i.e. higher placement in search rankings, and based off that placement, hook enough people to buy your product to make it worth your while. It’s like infomercials.Based on this experience, I would trust products that DIDN’T have paid reviews. Buyer beware.Addendums:- About the positive paid reviews: I’m sure if you got something for FREE (no risk to you at all), of course you would be nice about it. And I’m sure they made SURE the reviewers didn’t get broken products. I’m sure it cost them barely anything to give away free 5 cent products to buy people’s time to improve search page rankings.- I would be more forgiving if this product was half the price (being generous). I would be even more patient if it was a dollar. Then I could say, “Well, you get what you paid for”. But this product is EXTREMELY OVERPRICED FOR THE QUALITY.Last addendum: As I'm writing this review, the price has jumped up to $13 for ONE?? TOTAL RIPOFF. DO NOT BUY.",0,0

Also, they seem a big flimsy and I continually have to rescrew the bottom in to hold the ink in place.

RJ9VF9LO5V86H,"I wavered between one and two stars, ultimately choosing two because it does work.The main issue I am having is that the right side of all my papers has horrid black toner spots/ streaks/ melted toner. I tried the solution on Brother's website (cleaning the drum), but it doesn't work. It appears as if there is a hole in that area where the toner just flies out when printing. Luckily, it is all within the 1/2 inch margin, so I can cut it off and keep printing. Nothing looks pretty, though.

But hey, if I didn't make mistakes, I wouldn't be trying to buy erasers in bulk.The eraser quality is okay, though I find them to be a bit hard.

RKP98MY1JK67S,"As I sit here comparing my 2015 and (new) 2016 Moleskine Weekly Notebooks, there are two quite disappointing and unnecessary changes introduced for 2016:First, the eminently useful, vertical annual planning calendars in the front of the notebook - which allowed one to plan for four months at a time over two years - have been replaced by very conventional single-page mini monthly calendars, which are actually a disadvantage for planning purposes, and seem to miss the entire point about annual planning. What's more, there were TWO years of the previous vertical planning calendars, which (apparently to save page counts and production costs?) have been replaced by only ONE year of these stupid blocky monthly calendars. So there's no longer any place to jot in your plans for the next year, which is this case would be 2017. It seems like a whimsical decision by Moleskine, and at least for me (I do plan events and deadlines months and even years in advance), this really detracts from the previous usefulness of this product. Very disappointing.Second, the very nice typography of previous years has been replaced with a rather heavyset type which draws attention to itself on every page. Again, it seems a rather whimsical and counterproductive design decision. Very much an anti-Moleskine decision. (It's kind of like putting sharp edges on an iPhone, and I don't even own an iPhone but can understand the aesthetic appeal).I can't put my finger on all of the things that are wrong about this ""new and improved"" 2016 Moleskine Weekly Notebook, but there are several beyond those already mentioned.I've been using various Moleskine since before they were popular (10+ years?) and they obviously have a new designer who has made some very poor decisions. At this rate they are on track to join the unpleasant muck of the dozen other ""popular"" planners, most of which are detestable.",0,0

RJFL9ZUBH6F6A,"Edit: Changing my review from 4 to 2 stars. After several days of using the pen, it has become less and less reliable to the point that now, to write at all, I have to hold it at a 90-degree angle from the paper, or even upside down on the top of the nib. Also, comparing it to the V-301 Black fountain pen I bought only a few days before, the nib tip seems larger, which explains while it doesn't really achieve the ""fine point"" it's labeled as. I think I'm going to have to give up on this one. The black one is doing fine. They should be identical, so I'm not sure if this one is a lemon or it's a consistent design or manufacturing flaw.For the price, I like this pen a lot so far. It seems sturdy and writes well. It was a little difficult to get the ink started, but after rinsing the nib under the tap, I got the ink started and the pen writes smoothly. My only issue is that it's supposed to be a fine point but I find that it's writing thicker than any other pen I've used, fine or not It's almost like a marker!

R3LB57G85XUI6V,"When I first tried the stapler, I used about 50 magazine pages as a test. The stapler jammed. It continued to jam each time I tried it with anything, even when I was down to two pages. I called ACCO customer support, and after describing the issue they told me to return it or exchange it. I opted to return it. Although it's possible that mine was an exception, the part that the staples come out of was not properly aligned with the recess on the bottom plate, leaving nothing to get the staple to bend on the bottom.A positive point is that it comes with a lifetime guarantee against jamming when used with the correct (included) staples. I can't say how likely it is to jam, but if yours stops working after a while, you always have the option of calling customer service. They answered on the first ring, which is a plus.You might also consider the  PaperPro 60-Sheet High-Capacity Stapler (1200) , which has a capacity of fewer sheets (60) but works reliably and with very little force.

R34322OUZ599MV,"Purchased for a Canon Pixma MX922.  Locked up my printer with the ink carriage inaccessible, stuck at the far left, making a grinding sound when printer initiated.  Carriage would not come back to center and I kept getting error codes 5100 and 6000.  After two hours searching the internet I found a way to get the carriage back to the center so I could remove the defective ink cartridges.  This is what worked:  Open top of printer as if you were going to scan.  Plug in printer, turn printer on by pressing power, have cover of ink area access open as printer prepares to print.  Watch carriage travel and when it reaches center, unplug the power cord.  You can now access and remove the bad cartridges.  Replace with good cartridges and start printer as normal.  Printer working, error codes gone.I thought I had broken my printer which is less than one year old.  It appeared that the bad cartridges could not be removed and the error codes could not be resolved.  These ink cartridges are unusable for a MX922.

I now am out of money while I wait for it to return and now need to wait for the new scale to arrive. Small business with no easy at home shipping options? Very upset. The only upside was the product was packaged very well, otherwise it was a total bust. It wasn't even worth contacting the manufacturer, if I'm having these issues right out of the box, I can't even imagine what it would be like down the road. I should have listened to the other negative reviews, but I'm an optimist. This time it didn't pan out. Please shop around and make sure you buy the proper scale for your needs. This is very basic, and of course, inoperable.",0,0

This issue just keeps getting worse and worse,2-9-22After using these cartridges I am experiencing faded black printing. It says I have 60% left in cartridge with approx 1350 pages to print.

I am waiting on replacement yellow cartridge to see if that is so. These folks have the best cartridges so far. Only one out of four was not working properly. The other brand had three failures out of four. I am changing my review to a 5.

RXYEJYM93EDCB,"If I could rate this a ZERO, I would.  I have a graduate degree in computer science and more than 40 years experience in computer imaging systems.  While this device is fast and the image quality is ""ok"" the programming and documentation are terrible.  There is a USB connection to power the device and allow you to copy files to your PC. However, it appears that the first images you scan get stored in internal memory.  After scanning about 200 slides, I copied them to my PC over the USB connection.  Next day I scanned another 200 slides and copied them over the USB connection as well -- or, rather, I thought I copied them.  Turns out it copied the first ~90 slides I scanned the day before (but had subsequently deleted from the memory card), probably copying them from internal memory, instead of copying the first ~90 slides I scanned that 2nd day, but also copied the remaining 110  files.  Stupid me didn't check every single slide but just the last few to be sure I got all of them.  I deleted those files from the SD card and repeated this process for 4 days, today being the 4th, when I discovered that nearly 400 of the 800 files I scanned were not present on my PC, but rather 4 copies of the first 90 slides I scanned, plus any additional slides I happened to scan on those days.  Fortunately, I copied each day's work to a separate directory, so I still have about 1/2 the files I scanned.  The bad news is the numbering overlaps so I can't just combine them into a directory without renaming every file.  I contacted DigitNow customer service to see how I could resent the starting number for the next batch of slides, but it cannot be changed!  This is the WORST programming I've ever encountered.

I just tapped it down and that was it, 4 bits of metal came off and the spring and it no longer works.This product works veery well and extremely sturdy. The only drawback I can think of is that the screws are visible. If  it had come with  a cover then this item would be more aesthetically pleasing. It came with screws that has the drill bit on the end to drill through metal/wood so you don't need a drill to install this. It works very well and  you can easily operate it with no hands. It is just attached to a spring so when you step on it, it will draw up the kick stand. I would definitely purchase this again if I need a kick stand doorstop. Best I have used  since I don't need to bend over and dirty my hand to use it.",0,0

On the initial attempt, the first staple was mangled, became stuck, and nearly impossible to remove.  I remain in such disbelief at the inferior quality of this Swingline Optima 70 Desk Stapler, that I went online to search for more reviews (something I know should have done prior to purchase, but I erroneously trusted the brand).  It seems that I am far from alone in my disappointment and dissatisfaction.  Please do not confuse this unit with the other lower-capacity sheet Optima reviews.  This 70 model is WORTHLESS!

It will be different for each printer (I am trying to give them the benefit of the doubt here, but seriously they are ripping people off). In my case for all 3 color cartridges and a black cartridge in my HP6970 I get about 50-60 pages, and I rarely use color at all, I try to totally avoid it. The cost per page for me is roughly $1 a page (I should say was I am not going to use HP anymore you may not when you read the following, to see his actual chart you will need to go to the following link (assuming Amazon leaves it intact).https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Printing-Errors-or-Lights-Stuck-Print-Jobs/NEW-HP-2135-PRINTER-DOES-NOT-PRINT-MORE-THAN-30-PAGES-PER/td-p/6295623Here is the text of the reply from UNIXPLUS:""Here is a chart to help with Ink Cartridge Page Estimation.  All cartridges are based on a 5% coverage when new.Note:  A 5% coverage is about 6 single spaced lines of text on a page. No bold, graphics or pictures.  A full color photo would be 100% coverage.A ‘regular’ page of text would be about 72 lines and give us 30% coverage (more realistic).  Don’t forget the font type and size you use will use more ink too.Example: 564 Standard Black = 250 pages at 5% coverage.Let’s say your average page coverage you estimate is 30%.  So…250/6 = 41.Therefore the number of pages expected (30% coverage) out of your cartridge would be about 40 pages.A 564 Standard Color (300 pages) at 100% coverage yields – 300/20 = 15 pages.""Each printer manufacturer will be different, but look to see if you can find something like the above or actual reviews that talk about how many real world pages they actually get/print. To me this feels like false advertising as they often talk about cost per page in the 20 cents or less area, not my experience over 3 printers and replacement HP cartridges. I thought my kids were doing stuff and not telling me but looking at the page counts and finding that page at an HP forum totally hits the nail on the head. That being said as I have covered this has happened with 3 different printers I have had over the last 5 years, I thought the issues were on my end. I guess if you consider they don't openly seem to share the math of how their cartridges work on any of their advertising, it is my fault for not digging much deeper. Do yourself a favor and find a different printer manufacturer that actually prints more than 50-60 pages of typical black full page text pages, unless you love HP and don't mind spending close to a buck a page.",0,0

After the chair was put together it is a good chair. My problem is after about 6months the chair will now not stay at its highest position once you sit on it.  Over about 3-5mins the chair slowly ratchets down until it hits the bottom and then you have to re raise the chair.  It appears to be getting worse and worse.  I have had this happen with other chairs and figured it was due to the weight limit.  This chair has a 330lb weight limit which I am 280lbs so no reason it shouldn't be able to support my weight. Its a great chair when it stays up but it is really frustrating when you feel it start to drop.,0,0

RCOS88HOUFPKQ,"I probably should have paid more attention to reviews, but I had a table like this before as a rolling nightstand. My biggest concerns were the caster wheels, which are actually quite good themselves. Since I'm on carpet, leveling issues aren't noticeable but as others said, a few washers or a thin leveling nut will fix that.The stand itself is good steel tubing and pretty stable, so my biggest concern windows down to the actual ""countertop"" and the fact that it is cut into 3 parts to make the flat-pack more efficient for shipping. There can be no other possible reason they would do this. This creates an inconsistency in manufacturing where after assembling the pieces, they are not flush across the gaps of the joins. When you buy this as a laptop stand, this becomes a major irritant when trying to use a mouse because the crack jutting up catches the edge of the mouse and starts scratching the teflon mouse skates that make the mouse easy to slide.

We sat down, talked about what chores we would all agree on, what our star rewards would be, and who was represented by each star. Then I realized the magnets were not attached to the board. I attached them specifically following the instructions, only to place the board on the refrigerator and have it come crashing down to the floor. The magnets extend past the frame and definitely are all four touching the refrigerator. They are placed exactly as directed in the diagram and the weight is balanced. These magnets simply are not strong enough for this product. They don't work whatsoever. Now I will have to damage the board to remove them and make a special trip to Office Max to find replacement magnets that work. What was the point of purchasing this board and having it shipped to my home if I now have a board that I can't use, disappointed children, and need to go hunt around town for replacement magnets. Very unhappy with this product. I expected better from this manufacturer. Dont ruin your board and attach these magnets if you purchase this item.",0,0
R38ACQDNWMMGGX,I should have read the reviews. I paid 4 buck for four erasers. There are supposed to be 5 in each tube. Knew I should have just bought them at the store. Save yourselves the hassle. Find them in a store and pay less for more product.,1,1
R2KTOOCWCIRWF2,"I staple quite a bit at work, going through a couple lines of staples each week.  I burned through a lot of cheap staplers before finally ordering some better ones.The last couple years, I've used a  PaperPro Desktop Stapler, Black/Gray (1100) .  It was able to get through 25+ sheets easily and consistently with almost no effort.  Downside was a loud click/bang noise which was distracting in the office.  After quite a bit of use, the stapler broke and would no longer attempt to staple anything.I ordered this Swingline Optima 40 because it was meant for heavy duty use, could staple more sheets, and would staple them flat.  I've used it for a couple months with the recommended Optima staples and it's just not very good.First, the stapler can't get through much more than 25 sheets.  Definitely can't staple as much as the PaperPro, even though that was a cheaper light duty model.Second, the staple punches through quite a bit when using fewer than 5 sheets.  Often the back of the staple will come through the top page, sometimes all the way.  Other times, the staple won't lay flat or fails to staple at all.Third, the stapler can't accept a full line of staples.  Neither could the PaperPro, but these staples are specifically designed for the Optima.  You either have to try and break off the last 10 staples or break the staples in half.  It's annoying either way.On the plus side, it's built like a tank and when it works, flat staples are great.It might be silly to nitpick a stapler, but then again, you're reading a stapler review.I'll be ordering a  PaperPro Prodigy Stapler, Black/Silver (1110)  as I like the performance and can live with the bang noise.",0,0

R2HMGKIL367SIU,"With two kids, having to sharpen pencils and colours every second day took a lot of time so was on a look out for a good electric helical pencil sharpener that grinds your pencil instead of shaving it. The latter I found kept cutting up the soft wood in a lot of the colours and fancy pencils the kids wanted.It was great for about 8 months but one day it just wouldn't sharpen the pencils,  the blade was sharp, put new batteries in still no luck. Amazon have offered to replace it so 5 stars for the service thereI have gone with the same sharpener as until this point it worked well.Things to be aware - It can be noisyRechargeable batteries go flat quickly, I now use them with normal batteries. I didn't try it with the hybrid low discharge batteries.Batteries can be a pain to put in as the cover is very tight and it was difficult to see the polarityI would love a sharper that has both battery and mains one together and can deal with different sizes pencils, but either they are very expensive or the reviews have not been great.One I did consider was Jakar Electric Pencil Sharpener - Model 5151 which has good reviews, but is twice the price and heavier.UpdateAfter having two more items replaced as they didnt work.

I always do step 1 then step 2-- but apparently I have twice not executed this correctly (perhaps my finger was covering something- there are details on the box about what not to do). I know it is my fault if I don't follow instructions on the box carefully, but I have never had to read instructions on any other printer cartridge installation for any of my other printers over the years for a successful cartridge install. Perhaps they can spend a few more minutes designing an ink cartridge that is more failproof for someone in a rush who simply needs to open the cartridge, pop it in, and go. I'm giving one star because the cartridge should be more failproof -- again, I have NEVER had cartridges explode from any other cartridge system, so that seems to me part my fault (yes) but part the fault of their design team.

I've tried them on a variety of papers, even bought Arteza papers because I thought they would possibly made a difference. All to no avail. The pigment is hard to distribute and dilute. The colors end up blotchy and uneven. Also some of the markers started to run after just 3 drawings.The water marker provided is way too soft.Very disappointed.",0,0

I used a plain black ball point pen ( not even my nice planner pens which would have been a catastrophe)Each day/night etc. has another on the other side. It bleeds straight through making the next day/week etc. illegible.2.  Poor quality.  Within a few moments the spine totally separated from the planner.3. Confusing set up- days- weeks- months Are all in separate areas leaving you to have to flip through pages and pages to find each area. It makes no sense. It takes more time when this is supposed to INCREASE productivity. I have no use for this. Perhaps, I got a faulty planner.  ( I sure hope so since I saw mainly glowing reviews) For the price, a regular pen should not bleed through the pages  nor should the cover have totally detached from the spine in only minutes.I’m also hoping the company contacts me to let me know if this is a faulty planner. I really hope that is the issue.For now, SAVE YOUR MONEY! Definitely false advertising and poor construction.",0,0

R8LCLEIIIPGGA,"I have this printer for over five years in my home office, printed less than 10,000 pages so far. It is a solidly made machine and prints at extremely high quality. However, there are two problems. First, it is expensive to operate. Many businesses use the Xerox service where they pay per page, which is not a viable option for a home office. Second, it developed a 'phantom paper jam' problem, where it continuously tells you to open this door and that tray and refuses to print until some hidden gremlin inside decides it gave you sufficient amounts of crap and then it prints. It's a common problem and many isers have been complaining about it for years. FIX THE DAMN FIRMWARE, XEROX, OR I AIN'T BUYING NOTHING FROM YOU EFER AGAIN.I reduced the rating to one star.

RP2B2TCAIAJBO,"The following 4-star paragraph, written in January 2012,  has been edited into past tense to reflect both this product's potential and its incredibly short lifespan:This little bitty stapler had a lot going for it: Came with its own little box of 1,000 green-colored staples that fit all standard-size staplers.  Came in two very loud colors so that,  tiny though it was, it would have been easy to find on even the messiest desk. Plus which, it came with a key chain attached.  And attached to the key chain was a belt hook, which I hooked onto my pencil jar, making it easy to find amid clutter.  I'd have much preferred to choose my own color combination from Swingline's pretty good selection; would have gladly paid a buck or two more if given that option, especially since the one they sent me is yellow & orange, which would have been my absolute last choice had I had one. Also, it arrived from the Amazon outside seller just a couple of days after I ordered it.UPDATE 3/2/12:  Quit working after 30 days. Spent two days trying to get it to release a staple. Couldn't do it. So came back here and deducted two of its original four stars. And then discovered I was not alone in all this. Ah, well. You get what you pay for, I guess.

I haven’t used this type of pen in years (at least not this century) because I Love-Love-Live “gel pens.”THE CRITICAL AREAS: It is difficult to write with this pen. It is not so much its “ballpoint” technology, the ink is REALLY LIGHT. The ink is dispensed from this pen as if it were OLD-OLD-OLD, or just a cheap product.As a student there is a valid need fir a multi-colored pen. It would be better if said pen were gel, but I’ve used a few ballpoints a time or two and THIS PEN WHICH I PURCHASED YESTERDAY IS CRAPPY.Bic,By now, your firm should have surpassed expectations in the manufacturing of writing tools. Unfortunately, that does not appear to be the case. Some advise: perfect you classic models, the ones that have been around for decades, or transition to manufacturing anything else. At least this way, you can claim to be “new” to the industry.And if it was too difficult to follow, besides the blue ink (which is also weak) all three other colors( (red, green and black) require pressing down firmly or retracing each stroke in order to be properly read—BIC= YOU CAN DO MUCH BETTER THAN THIS NONSENSE.CONSUMER: I’ve tried the pilot version and it comes with a .5 size line.

If you apply ANY pressure the lead and metal pin slide back up into the body of the compass, leaving you without a point to anchor the compass or anything to mark the circle.

RKBMHJF3OPGR3,"UPDATE:  I was happy with this pencil -- I purchased a total of 3.  When the lead ran out, I tried Pentel Super hi-Polymer Leads (HB, H, and 2H) and found it doesn't work--it slides back up inside.  I tried a piece of lead which was working (gripping) in my Alvin Draft/Matic DM03.  I put it in the Alvin DR03, and again, the lead slid up inside despite working fine in the non-retractable DM03.  I tried this with all three Alvin DR03's, and all fail to ""grip"" standard 0.3mm lead that works fine with other pencils.  I have ordered  Faber-Castell 0.35mm lead and Pentel Ain Stein Leads, and will try those.  But a 0.3mm pencil should work with all standard leads.  So far, this pencil only works with the lead it came with -- one and done.  Great pencil, but it should not be ""one and done"" disposable.----- Old review below -----This simple blue pencil is my #1 pencil because 0.3mm is always sharp, the tip holds the lead well and dispenses it evenly, the rubber grip feels comfortable.  But other 0.3mm pencils to that as well.  What makes this pencil stand out is the retractable tip.  If you drop this pencil, you won't destroy the fine tip and lose your $10 pencil.",0,0

The weight is good but it is so slippery it is hard to hold onto. Maybe it is my hand size and arthritic thumb. It doesn't have an eraser built in somehow I missed that.

R2Y0CUVQU0FB7C,"I have really had a lot of trouble with staplers over the years. Just like anyone in an office, and staplers that don't work is one of the most frustrating things.For a while I gave up on these more expensive type, because they seemed to break just as easily. I bought the cheap $5 kind, and but decided to try this one because it was supposedly able to staple up to 40 pages with regular staples. Which seemed great, unless you staple large documents on a daily basis, buy extra large staples is a hassle especially for a small family business.When i first bought this stapler I wrote a review that said ""I am very impressed with how well this stapler is working and will continue to work. The stapler it self is heavy, though it doesn't require much effort to staple."" That was in August of 2014, it is now  January of 2015 and I am on the hunt for a new stapler.This stapler barely lasted 6 months, which is around $5 per month. The stapler is now bending on the right side of the staple and not going through the paper properly. Moreover it now feels stuck when attempting to staple.Not worth the money, the $5 staplers would have lasted almost as long for 1/6 of the price.I really want a stapler that just works, that I don't have to worry with replacing often.",0,0

R358ZGE0QCGUTM,"I had previously purchase coin cases like these listed at 26mm for my Arkham Horror card game, and they worked great, but I needed more for my D6 board game. I bought these because they were listed at the same size and I saw someone else picked them up with the Arkham Horror game, as well as the high review score, so I figured they were good to go.No dice. The packaging definitely says 26mm, but as can be seen in the pictures, they are far too large. The internal diameter of the new ones is 30mm, as compared to the 26mm diameter of my old ones (from a different company), measured with my caliper.These would be fine if they were the correct size, but they aren't, and it seems like it's not a mix-up of sending the wrong one since the sticker indicates they should be 26mm. The only saving grace is that they were only $7, but that's still $7 wasted unless I find something that's about 30mm to use them with. I guess they did come in a nice case I might find a use for....These are the ones I had bought previously (smaller ones pictured), which I avoided since they are now more than double the cost of the ones I recently bought.https://www.amazon.com/PRESIDENTIAL-Direct-Fit-Airtight-Capsule-Holder/dp/B01H28MP3M/ref=sr_1_29?dchild=1&keywords=26mm+coin+case+50&qid=1596758679&sr=8-29",0,0

R1WEQDCML4BE1Y,"If you’re after the short, down and dirty version, here it is…This program is a complete waste of time and energy.Now, for the actual review.If you’re after a simple GPS or mapping program, others are freely available.  And this program is about as far from “simple” as any software I’ve ever written, reviewed, tested, or even seen.  It’s “EZ Nav Route Wizard” is their sad attempt at providing a simpler interface by bypassing most of their ""features"", but it’s power is nil.  If you want simple directions from one place to another, that’s their way of giving it to you.  However, I’m baffled by why, if that’s what you’re after, you’re even considering this.  What DeLorme should have done, instead of wasting time developing a goofy simplistic option like this and sticking it in their ridiculously bulky and inefficient program is spend some time and effort simplifying the entire thing.  Imagine the control panel/dashboard of a 777 jetliner, with a seemingly infinite array of stuff, and a button in the middle that says “Fly to Chicago”.  Yeah, nice idea DeLorme.  Why not just make the thing easier to fly?  See, the bottom line is none of us is trying to fly a jetliner, we’re just trying to drive to a few places as quickly, easily and efficiently as possible, and we don’t need the dash of a 777 to do it.If, like many people who were abandoned by Microsoft when they stopped producing Streets & Trips even though it was consistently rated #1, you’re looking for a program that serves as a GPS and a routing program, DELORME STREET ATLAS IS NOT IT.  This program has extremely limited power in this regard – so much so that there’s no way to include it in that category.  If you, for instance, have a round trip to plan, where you know your start and end points, and have multiple stops to make but aren’t sure what order to put them in, or lets say you’re a service technician or salesman or a delivery person and you’re trying to maximize your efficiency by adjusting your start and stop times for each day, along with the duration of each of your stops, throwing sticks to the wind and trying to make sense of where they land might be more productive than using DeLorme SA.  It allows for NO start or stop time, and entering a duration for each stop is enough to make you want to hurt people.  As a comparison, in MS S&T, if you want to adjust your start time or a stop’s duration, you simply double click that address in the left pane, which lies in the same window as the place where you entered it.  Up pops the time window for that stop.  If you want to do it in DeLorme  SA, here are the steps…  make sure you’re in the Route tab.  Then click the Advanced button on the bottom left.  Then locate (scroll if necessary) the stop you’d like to adjust and click on it in the center pane.  Then click the Stop Pref’s button on the right side.  NOW you can enter a duration for your stop.  It makes me imagine a microwave where the some of the number buttons are on the left of the microwave, some are in the middle below the door, and the rest of the buttons are on the right side, and they seem to have forgotten to put a ""start"" button on the thing. And for good measure, let’s remove all the quick setting buttons from the microwave.  You know, the quick minute button and all those – they’re way too useful.My bottom line for this software is you’re probably only looking at it for one of a few reasons, and it just doesn’t do a good job at ANY of them.  You’re options for a Streets and Trips replacement are thin for sure, and I’m still looking.  If that’s what you’re in search of, good luck, SA is NOT IT.  If you need a simple GPS/mapping program, this is NOT IT.  Simple isn’t apparently in this software team’s vocabulary.  And if you’re looking for a routing program of any kind, with any level of efficiency to it at all, this is also NOT IT.This is, hands down, the single worst-written piece of software I’ve laid my eyes on since the Windows 3.x days.  I wish 0 stars was an option.  No joke.",0,0

R13LGSU6FP5A42,"Before you read the one ""Perfect"" review, please read mine. I was very happy to find this scale to work with my Endicia Account and my Dymo LabelWriter 4XL. Upon arrival I shipped my first package. When we took the package to the U.S. Post Office, they weighed the package and declared that it was 5.6 more ounces and would cost more money to ship. This defeated the purpose of purchasing and printing postage.  So I called Dymo and their customer service was very nice and after over an hour on the phone they told me that the scale must be defective and will be replaced. So I received a new one today, and the new scale is exactly the same. I was told by Dymo to use weights from a gym as a constant to weigh on the scale. When I put 40 lbs on the old scale and the new scale and they both displayed 39 lbs. This is totally unacceptable to be 1lb off from the actual weight. So when I use this scale it will always print the wrong postage.  The manual says the fluctuation is +-.4lb but it is more in some cases.  Dymo should really produce a more accurate scale, especially if you are using it connected to a computer through USB and using the Endicia software.  For our company, this scale is totally unusable. I am quite surprised that Dymo would put out a product that does not display the proper weight. Save yourself the trouble and get another scale.",0,0

Go to put the cards in and the edge of the card hits the hole punch area for the rings!  I've tried to capture a picture of this for you.

R17V9KS6J0RSB1,"This performance planner and the company behind it have some strengths as in journalling goals, strategies, progress, beliefs etc is always a good idea ... so what's the downside?a) The Planner itself only lasts 2 months, so if use daily, as you should in a year, 6 copies would be needed costing a small fortune for what is basically the same sheet repeated 365 times.b) It is totally based around High Performance thinking, so unless you have read, liked and want to use that method the content is of dubious value.c) The format of the journal is HUGE like an ancient desk diary (I'm ancient, I know!) so useless for those who move around. Very impractical.d) I foolishly bought the planner thinking it would be good for anyone setting goals, but as I say it isn't unless you like High Performance book/thinkinge) I've read the first chapter of this book after ordering the planner (my mistake) and realised from that and then signing up for more info or checking out the blog than the author and his team are so hardcore sales directed (yes, they are High Performance) they are exhausting to read or listen or correspond with unless you already believe in this aggressive ""How Great I Am"" approach of the author and his team.f) I believe I either bought or got a free copy of an earlier Brendon Burchard book and had forgotten I had ... probably as I repressed it as being against my values (I'm more human based and less sell, sell, sell orientated) so i found it rather distastefulg) I am reading James Clear ""Atomic Habits"" which I like a lot and recommend but for some reason, someone with his agreement has made a planner too, but it is quite expensive for what in both his and High Performance should really be included s a worksheet in their books that can be downloaded and printed out as a PDF and then photocopied or simply copy the page from the book, or write down in a $2 notebook the key elements.h) It feels like having eaten the meat, the planners offer you the same bones, over and over again at several times the price of the meat. I'm lazy, yes! So I like some of the work to have been done instead of having to create my own journal but am dubious, at least in this case, that its worth it.I gave this Planner 2 stars instead of 1 for two reasons, its production is of very high quality (well done!) and clearly a lot of people like High Performance and don't find it as annoying as me (suspect it could partly be a cultural thing, not being from the USA).",0,0

So your answers is to order more n replace it every few wks/month?? Provided it doesn't ruin what you taped it to when you remove it.

However, this stapler has caused so many headaches that I have no choice but to share my experience to save other of the misery.First, I'll start off by acknowledging how well the stapler is built. It feels well constructed and quite sturdy. The ability to quickly reveal the slide out staple holder is great. Unfortunately, that's where the benefits end.When it comes to functionality, this stapler could not be worse. From the moment I took it out of the box and made my first staple, it has been getting jammed. Without exaggeration, every one in two staples results in a jam. Even easy paper loads of just 5-15 sheets would result in a jam. In fact, it reached a point where I would often print two copies of a document so that I could easily throw the first one out if the stapler jammed and the resulting destruction to the corner of my document made it unusable.I've tried to get by with the stapler's very limited functionality by using it only when needed for larger stacks of paper.

They’re ok if you scribble on plastic and add water to the paint before touching the paper, but dark blue becomes grey and purple becomes pink etc.  Would not recommend for watercolour use.  Haven’t tried all the pens yet, but one has come empty/dry and the water brush let’s to much water out even when not being pressed in the middle.

REVQZDGLV67TH,"This chart is very confusing.  There are a lot of questions about using it for multiple children, and the responses given seem very misleading.  I'm actually using it for just one child, but I don't really see how it would work for more than one child.There are spaces for chores on the left of the chart.  Then there's a column for each day of the week across the top.  There's one extra column at the far right.At the bottom it shows a little space to record ""Names"" as though it's for multiple children.  There are 4 different colored stars depicted next to the lines, which sort of makes me feel like there should be a star for each child.  There isn't.  There are only two star magnets, and they are as depicted.  They're a little bit larger than the spaces.  I just don't understand what they are for.  You wouldn't use them to check off chores completed - there are only two of them.  Maybe to indicate which chore each child should complete?  But then there should be four magnets to match the four names.  Two star magnets that are a bit bigger than the spaces...?  We ended up using the star magnets on the fridge.And finally - the dry erase marker.  The quality of the actual marker is good, but the star stamp side doesn't work.  It's hard, not like a sponge.  It would work on paper, but on another hard surface, it's impossible to make a star stamp.  Very disappointing as I thought - Oh well if I don't get what the star magnets are for.  I have this nifty stamp!  - Not so much.The actual quality of the board is good.  It's sturdy, graphics are nice, pen is of good quality.  I didn't use the magnets included to mount the board.  Instead I used 3M strips to attach it to her door.  We are still using it, but I went out and bought magnetic push pins to mark off the chores completed each day.",0,0

R3UGZR5WT0XWSK,"I am a teacher, and these were purchased for me by generous benefactors, which is why I will not have the ""Confirmed Purchaser"" tag at the top of this review.I teach special education students, and they have difficulty using rulers, let alone geometric compasses. The cheap plastic ones the school provides are frustrating to use, so I was looking for another option.I was happy with Mr. Pen's little geometry packet, the $9.99 one that comes with compasses and rulers and such, and so I was happy to take a gamble on these reasonably-priced compasses.The idea was that these compasses LOCK, which makes it easier to draw circles. My students were having difficulties with the compasses falling open as they drew. These were going to be the answer to my problems and I was going to buy many more once I was able; I was expecting to furnish an entire classroom set.10 seconds into our first activity with them. ""Mine's busted."" And then another, and another. I tried to fix them but it is extremely difficult to set up the lead and point properly, as the groove in which they're supposed to sit it totally insufficient. It slides askew as you try to put it in. And the pressure on them in inadequate to hold them in place. Over and over again the points and lead would simply slide up into the compass, making them useless to anyone, let alone students who struggle with motor skills.

R3EEBORRTO4RTD,"If you’re after the short, down and dirty version, here it is…This program is a complete waste of time and energy.Now, for the actual review.If you’re after a simple GPS or mapping program, others are freely available.  And this program is about as far from “simple” as any software I’ve ever written, reviewed, tested, or even seen.  It’s “EZ Nav Route Wizard” is their sad attempt at providing a simpler interface by bypassing most of their ""features"", but it’s power is nil.  If you want simple directions from one place to another, that’s their way of giving it to you.  However, I’m baffled by why, if that’s what you’re after, you’re even considering this.  What DeLorme should have done, instead of wasting time developing a goofy simplistic option like this and sticking it in their ridiculously bulky and inefficient program is spend some time and effort simplifying the entire thing.  Imagine the control panel/dashboard of a 777 jetliner, with a seemingly infinite array of stuff, and a button in the middle that says “Fly to Chicago”.  Yeah, nice idea DeLorme.  Why not just make the thing easier to fly?  See, the bottom line is none of us is trying to fly a jetliner, we’re just trying to drive to a few places as quickly, easily and efficiently as possible, and we don’t need the dash of a 777 to do it.If, like many people who were abandoned by Microsoft when they stopped producing Streets & Trips even though it was consistently rated #1, you’re looking for a program that serves as a GPS and a routing program, DELORME STREET ATLAS IS NOT IT.  This program has extremely limited power in this regard – so much so that there’s no way to include it in that category.  If you, for instance, have a round trip to plan, where you know your start and end points, and have multiple stops to make but aren’t sure what order to put them in, or lets say you’re a service technician or salesman or a delivery person and you’re trying to maximize your efficiency by adjusting your start and stop times for each day, along with the duration of each of your stops, throwing sticks to the wind and trying to make sense of where they land might be more productive than using DeLorme SA.  It allows for NO start or stop time, and entering a duration for each stop is enough to make you want to hurt people.  As a comparison, in MS S&T, if you want to adjust your start time or a stop’s duration, you simply double click that address in the left pane, which lies in the same window as the place where you entered it.  Up pops the time window for that stop.  If you want to do it in DeLorme  SA, here are the steps…  make sure you’re in the Route tab.  Then click the Advanced button on the bottom left.  Then locate (scroll if necessary) the stop you’d like to adjust and click on it in the center pane.  Then click the Stop Pref’s button on the right side.  NOW you can enter a duration for your stop.  It makes me imagine a microwave where the some of the number buttons are on the left of the microwave, some are in the middle below the door, and the rest of the buttons are on the right side, and they seem to have forgotten to put a ""start"" button on the thing. And for good measure, let’s remove all the quick setting buttons from the microwave.  You know, the quick minute button and all those – they’re way too useful.My bottom line for this software is you’re probably only looking at it for one of a few reasons, and it just doesn’t do a good job at ANY of them.  You’re options for a Streets and Trips replacement are thin for sure, and I’m still looking.  If that’s what you’re in search of, good luck, SA is NOT IT.  If you need a simple GPS/mapping program, this is NOT IT.  Simple isn’t apparently in this software team’s vocabulary.  And if you’re looking for a routing program of any kind, with any level of efficiency to it at all, this is also NOT IT.This is, hands down, the single worst-written piece of software I’ve laid my eyes on since the Windows 3.x days.  I wish 0 stars was an option.  No joke.",0,0

So we watched some YouTube videos and proceeded to remove, clean and dry the print head. We noticed in these repair videos that the faulty cartridges were all off-brand (clear ends vs Canon's black ends)..The two replacement cartridges had dumped ink inside the printer. After getting the same error code again, we repeated the process, with the same result. We called a printer repair store, and they told us that 70% of their printer repairs are because of off-brand ink cartridges, and that generally, the repair costs as much as a new printer these days.

For the feather, it was in a plastic sleeve but still a bit mangled.While the idea is good and the components of a real feather-pen writing experience were all there, all in all, this was a disappointing product.",0,0
R3FVI2OYHRP4H5,"Bought three sets for my school for our summer printing order, which we always place in May for the coming school year. We opened them and found that they were ALL Asia Pacific ink and do not work in our printers. As the allowable time period for returns had passed us by, we were stuck with three VERY expensive sets of squarish crayons. If it were possible to give this vendor negative stars, I would. They FAILED to clearly state the ink region ANYWHERE on their page when we purchased it, AND then were more than happy to use a technicality to not have to refund our CHILDREN'S Money.

Changed to 2nd cartridge and it printed the new job but we will see how many i get out of this one. I will never buy refilled cartridges again.

I also had to remove and replace the chip on the assembly (super easy to do) so the cartridge showed the printer the right color and level of toner.No more vertical lines!!!This video helped me understand the components of the cartridge;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jn6DpDC8g8UThis was the video that helped me remove and replace the proper components (even though not in English, pretty obvious);https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b993mOHvQu0I hope this review helps others correct their issue with this sellers toner cartridges, as it did me!!!",0,0

But I really wish I bought a different product.I bought this to add some extra storage for a new vanity set up. I knew it was on the smaller side than a more faithful Ikea Alex dupe, plus it was a true black finish, so I thought it would be a good fit for my needs since I didn’t plan on putting in anything really big. Plus, it was made of solid wood for the frame instead of chipboard throughout, so it had to be sturdy, right?I wish I paid more attention to the reviews.The wood is not well treated. It splintered in many spots and lacks predrilled holes where I feel they are needed to prevent splintering or screws being put in at bad angles. Some pieces arrived split and splintered in spots. This caused me to forego some screws, though luckily no where I think it is really needed for structural support. But this issue could happen easily somewhere that it is needed.I hade a hard time getting the casters in and needed to find a piece of wood that would fit above the wheels to hammer in the last one without breaking it. Major design flaw.The casters are just plastic bars, and they cause a lot of friction with pulling the drawers in and out. Some drawers take a little more effort to pull open than others. They’re also white and because the drawer faces aren’t designed to perfectly fill the frame, you can see them which is not particularly attractive. Mine might look worse because of the lack of predrilled holes to help keep the drawers uniform when you assemble them. It looks as cheap as it is, which is sad because I’ve paid the same price at Target for shelves that look great.At the end of the day, flat pack furniture that isn’t wall mounted should ideally only require a screwdriver and a mallet to assemble properly. Affordable flat pack furniture should for people that don’t have access to power tools. This required a power drill, an extra wood bit, and would have benefited from me using my leveler.

Some things that do irritate me is it can become top heavy if you don't have the legs adjusted correctly, but after about 3 months it's really stood up and become a necessity at the moment for me.  I change the orientation regularly (3-4 times a week) and it hasn't gotten loose or broken yet. For the price you really can't go wrong if you need an adjustable table top for a chair.The only other complaint is I'd like the desk to have at least a lip on either side so that my mouse doesn't slip off whenever I move..  I've had to keep one of desk a little shorter than I'd like by keeping the first link parallel to the desk fort that reason, this is the primary reason for 4 stars.Update:  My first one broke a link but I blamed it on me accidentally knocking it off a table , and since it had worked well for what it was, I got another.

Ever thought about instigating madness in the mind of your preferred packaging specialist?If so, this is the perfect product for you!To call this “tape” is so far below it’s true purpose. This is not tape. This... is a mildly sticky, highly fragile, variable thickness, transparent, colored polymer on a roll.Strong? No.Easy to use? No.Capable as an unsolvable puzzle? Yeah, maybe.It all starts when your victim attempts to find the start of the roll... its so thin and imperceptible at an edge, that they will swear there is no edge at all. I literally used a razor blade to try and locate the end... sliding around and around in either direction to no avail. Eventually I used a quality packing tape, to tape over where a I thought an edge may be and pulled up the new roll’s edge. Beautiful insanity!This is where it really gets good... your victim now things they have a start. Home free... Not so fast track star! As soon as they begin to pull the piece they need... Pop, rip, tear, desentigrate! Spectacular!With their spirit crushed, they set their mind to understanding the complexities of defeat. Tweezers, knives, watercolor paintbrushes and even lavender oil are brought to solve the mystery. The only clue to this evil’s diabolical nature however is the first usable size piece to come from the roll shows a preposterous hole in the middle with the oddly teardrop shaped hole.This is where it ends. The marbles are lost. The cheese is slid completely off the cracker. All that is left is to decide where they will begin to dig their grave.Oh, in case you’re wondering if its just a one roll fluke...

R8IP14SMJSRU2,"After reading the reviews I ordered two, hoping that one of them would work. As expected, actually one of them worked, the other one was completely dead. Unfortunately there are virtually no alternatives for 9mm pencils that work with batteries. (If you know of any, please comment).The good thing with this sharpener is that the blade and the motor are basically fine and the construction is so simple that most issues are easy to spot and fix: If you unscrew the screw in the battery compartment you can take off the top part to look inside. It needs a bit of force because there are two latches in the front. Take care not to lose the little black plastic switch next to the sharpener hole. Don't bother trying to take off the bottom part. You don't need to.In my case, one of the contacts in the battery compartment was not soldered properly, so I fixed the solder joint and it worked. Also, the security mechanism that keeps the blade from moving when the front cover is not attached, is extremely flimsy. If you have no children or other people in your household who may try to touch the rotating blade, I recommend getting rid of that mechanism and simply soldering the two metal pieces near the front of the device together. If you do not solder, duct tape will work just fine. While you are at it, check if the two metal pieces next to the sharpener hole touch properly when you insert a pencil. If not, adjust and secure with duct tape. ^^Now you can put it back together. Make sure that the little black plastic switch is in place before you close the top.

Kept shaking, then tried several more times, and the tip came loose.  Stuck the tip back in (because I love a challenge).  What a piece of cr*p, and I'm being objective in this review.  Now, I read some positive comments that suggested they worked well, so there are a few good ones out there.  Is it a QA thing?  Does the tip dry up so it won't absorb paint?  Maybe it's an expiration date problem?  Whatever the issue, it was a few bucks down the drain and into the landfills.",0,0
RMTRZV0X3GIS1,"Not happy. These are NOT card stock or anything other than cheap, thin, plain paper cut to 4 x 6 size. Guess they would work fine if you don't mind ink showing through to the other side because they are so thin.TIP to SAVE $$: Use these index cards with your microscope instead of pricey glass slides!We use these in the hobby of raising monarch butterflies. Having raised 500+ butterflies this season, and using a microscope to check each for OE disease before releasing them, these index card have been very useful. Since glass slides for each one would be incredibly expensive, we opted to use a piece of clear-view scotch tape to collect the scales/spore sample by rubbing it gently onto the butterfly's abdomen, and then affixing it to these paper index cards.While the method has worked well, the cards are too thin to be able to use both sides, so it just takes more space and more cards than I think is really necessary, had these just been made of cardstock instead of plain paper.I am using them because 3 times I have ordered ""index cards"" and they are all made of cheap, thin paper and not card stock anymore (including the ones at Walmart), but I won't buy these again. Hope the review helps!",0,0

The pens have a very smooth draw on paper, but skip about 30% of the strokes. It's as if the ink is dry and my notes look like chicken-scratch now.

RBJP4C4NL1IMY,"I really wanted to like this journal, because the price is so reasonable and the paper is nice and sturdy - my sharpies don't show through at all!  And the dots even mostly line up across the pages (useful for the monthly spread).  (so 2 stars for that)However, after exactly 1 week of gentle indoor (no traveling) use, without ever having even been carried around in a bag, only by hand around the house (hi, pandemic), the binding has surprisingly cracked (see photo).  It's such a shame because there's a lot to like about this journal.  The paper is almost card-stock thick and very smooth - I've used markers (even Sharpies) on it, with repeated strokes over the same place, and erased many pencil marks, without any deterioration or show-through.However, it is so smooth that my Pilot Frixion pens just slide right off of them without writing, which is a bummer because I specifically bought this journal for bullet-journaling and writing in appointments, which often change at the last moment, so I'd like to be able to use my frixion pens, which are erasable.  The ink just balls up and doesn't write (for the XF) or takes many attempts to produce a splotchy pale line (F or M).  I've never had this problem with these pens before - they write on all normal copy papers, but this paper is quite slick/slippery in its smoothness.  If you have a good-flowing Pilot G-2 XF, they write well on this paper, and so I was willing to overlook this difficulty (no Frixion pens), but the binding broke...  I really wish this binding had held, and pages were not falling out.In addition, as another reviewer noted, the cover does not tightly fit the spine, and does puff out, noticeably, both when open and closed.  Its looseness means you can feel the bumpy binding (that then cracked), so it doesn't feel as professionally made as moleskine or rhodia or even leuchtturm1917.  I was willing to overlook this as a cosmetic issue that was worth it because of the price, but the pages falling out is a no-go.I have contacted the seller, but not yet heard back.  I will update this review after this issue has been resolved (a refund, I imagine).  If I do not update this review, then they did not get back to me.Also, they are offering free pack of pens to amazon buyers, in exchange for reviews of a positive nature that do not mention the pens, so be wary of some of these reviews.

R15DKCCNHS2KXW,"This is the first time I've felt compelled to write a review on Amazon. I've generally had good experiences with items I've bought, thinking that the overall ratings would be correlated to a reasonable extent with the actual quality of the product. This was not the case with this toner cartridge.I wish I had paid more attention to the 500+ 1-star reviews. It's easy to disregard them when you see a relatively high overall rating, but in this case, I am sorry that I didn't heed the multitude of warnings for this product.I have a Brother HL-2270DW printer, and this was the first time I was replacing the toner cartridge for it. I followed the very poorly written instructions that came with this cartridge and had no success in convincing my printer to turn off its error light. I tried all possible resets that I could find online, and I even called Brother (which included a 30-minute hold time) to ask for support over the phone. Brother had no idea what was wrong and referred me to a local business machines store, where they were able to confirm that this toner cartridge was the problem. The toner simply doesn't work.My advice -- DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. I am very disappointed that Amazon still offers this item given how many awful reviews exist. Then again, I'm very disappointed in my own naive hope that a significantly-cheaper-than-brand-name product from this manufacturer would be a sufficient replacement. No free lunch, I guess. :)",2,1

R2INITHCITUCVB,"The old bait and switch.I ordered what I thought was going to be the Ultra Pro ""Special Combo Deal"" of the sleeves and the top loads and instead they shipped me an inferior brand. Maybe the vendor or customers think its the same, but nevertheless it's not what I ordered. I can only assume it's a cheaper product and Wowzzer makes more money when they sub out the actual product for a cheaper one. I guess it's always a gamble when you order online. Makes you think - how can there be so many positive reviews for a product? Answer skews to the shining 5 star reviews must be written by the vendors cousin, brother or nephew.Here's a little about me as a hobbyist: I'm a sports card and memorabilia collector and have been collecting since 1984. I have a special collection of valuable rookie cards and only trust placing them in the right plastic sleeves and hard holders. I've used Ultra Pro in the past and that's why I ordered them. But as mentioned, the vendor shipped another brand (BCW) instead.The sides of the BCW top loaders have awkward oil and glue markings. Overall, they are thinner than Ultra Pro. BCW holders also have more give (an undesirable characteristic). They are softer and more flexible then the Ultra Pro ones pictured. This means they are not the best product to protect your cards.  Don't get me wrong, they are not horrible. I just don't like them as much as the ones I thought I was buying, which were a better product.I guess the one thing I can't complain about is the price. They are very cheap and offer decent value, hence the 2 stars. Just be fair warned, you may not get the brand you want and if you read the small print they point out that the ol' ""switcheroo"" is likely a comin.I would not use these for my more valuable cards but perhaps those I might sell to someone else in a short amount of time.

R18Z20D37ZK6VE,"I used this scale for years without any problem. Up until 2011. The hallmark feature of this scale is supposed to be its ability to download UPS, FedEX and USPS rates from the internet. Royal has failed to upgrade the software for this machine in years, and as a result, you will NEVER be able to use the built-in rates. The available software will not install on Windows 7 if it THINKS you have a 64bit machine. You must run a 32bit version, and the software may still not install. If you can get it to install, you will not be able to upgrade your machine, i.e. the firmware. It will work on 32bit XP, but it still cannot update the firmware, just the latest rates Royal has compiled.

R197RKC36RJX2D,"I gave it a low rating because of the following:1. One of three units I bought caused paper jam warning. Repeated re-installation could not clear it.

No pictures or photographs.You get what you paid for. It's true that ""your yield may vary"" and that at 1/4 of the price of a genuine Brother cartridge (2600 pages claimed), one should not expect to get the same number of pages.

R11HZ5JG5G411I,"The first time I bought one of these carts was about 2 years.  I used it to go grocery shopping, about a 4-mile round-trip for me, up and down a lot of hills. I buy a lot of food at one time because the trip is exhausting and this cart generally carried it all very well.  It folded nicely and was easy to store.  It was great!About 1 year after owning it, one of the wheels fell off on a shopping trip.  I managed to save it and get the cart home again.  I repaired the wheel with a simple screw and it worked fine for another year.About 2 months ago on a grocery trip, another wheel fell off.  This time I could *not* find the lost wheel, so I could not repair the cart again.  I ordered a new one, thinking it would be as great as the old one had been.I WAS WRONG.What I got was a piece of JUNK (I'd used stronger words, but I want this review to be posted.)  The types of wheels had been changed.  Instead of the former rubber ones, these were now plastic.  The problem was these new wheels were TOO BIG for the cart itself!  The cart would no longer fold properly, because it had NOT been redesigned for these larger wheels.  The new wheels also interfered with the ability for the card to move properly!I went on my first grocery shopping trip with the new cart.  Getting the cart there and back was an ongoing problem during the trip because the wheels kept hitting the metal of the cart.I returned home with my food and when I got there, one of the metal supports for a wheel *BROKEN*, nearly collapsing the cart and spilling all my groceries.The cart was RUINED.  It was UNREPAIRABLE.  After using it ONCE!  I threw it out in the trash the next day.  I couldn't stand to see it and think of the money I had wasted.I am on a very-fixed income; the lost of the $20 for this piece of junk cart is money I could not afford to waste.  But this cart is now long gone, taken away in the trash where it belonged in the first place.  It should NEVER have been sold because of the replaceable of the old type of wheels with cheaper ones which did NOT FIT.  Either wheels of the same size as had been previously used for it should have been added - or the metal cart itself should have been redone to properly fit these larger wheels.Now I have to find and buy and pay for another large cart to carry my groceries; I have to find a way to afford it.  You can be certain I will *NOT BUY* a 3rd one of these carts!** UPDATE! **I also posted negative feedback to this seller's account.  A short time after that I got a email from him offering me a full-refund if I would change my negative feedback to positive.I said ""No"".The fact is, this seller is likely going to *keep* selling these shopping cards that are defective as can be seen in the *recent*, very negative reviews here.  He is also likely going to keep selling a lot more of these carts in different colors in other Amazon listings.I'm out my money, which as I said, I truly cannot afford to waste.  However, I am not going to change ANYTHING that might warn people here these carts are seriously defected because changes that were made to the wheels -- and DO NOT BUY ONE!  I can't afford to have waste money of this piece of junk, but I would rather loose that money in the hope that someone else might NOT buy one of these carts because of my review.* * * * * * * * * * *AGAIN, DO NOT BUY THIS CART!  IT IS JUNK!  IT *WILL* BREAK A *VERY* SHORT TIME AFTER YOU START USING IT!* * * * * * * * * * *",0,0

So if you do plan to buy this toner, make sure to test it right away to see if it work not. After reviewed my previous orders from different sellers I am not sure if they are the same OEM product. However, Amazon seems always link to this Cool Toner Compatible link now, even though my previous purchase link name doesn't have ""Cool Toner"".",0,0

R1L9FI1C45ZAB7,"Like many other reviews have said, this thing is a flimsy piece of crap. I bought it with the intention of using it for a specific project and didn't want to break the bank on a more expensive compass, so I settled for this. The moment I tried to use it, the issues started piling up. Every time you try to draw with this, several different things are going to happen. One, the needle at the center of the circle will move out of place. Two, the line it produces, if it produces one at all, will be broken and deformed as you struggle to twist it while keeping the center in place. Three, the arm will bend all over the place once you finally get the pressure and directionality perfect. Four, the arms will move further apart as you go, forcing you to readjust after every single circle you manage to make. Anything you manage to draw out of this will be an extremely thick broken line in the general shape of a circle, likely one without a consistent radius. Do yourself a favor and pay the extra $10-20 bucks for a higher quality model. This is a waste of money in every possible sense.",0,0

R11EZ9EP2X4VUP,I do not recommend this. I got it at work and it is the most uncomfortable pad i have ever gotten. the padding is stiff compared to gel based ones. The pads on the bottom do not stick but are a hardened rubber that slides around on the desk. If you are not at the perfect height which is based on your desk to wrist ratio  you will end up with a kink in your wrist. This aggravates my Carpel Tunnel worse than any pad I have used. The one I have at home for gaming and long computer use is much better. It is the deadpool mouse pad with a gel chest where my wrist rests gently in the crease of his pecks. If there was a 0 star rating I would be using that for the above purchase.,0,0

The description doesnt mention the size, it takes up half my desk when it’s open, so it sits closed on the floor and I keep my to-do page on the desk.

R2YUAWMV2P1BYN,"This company talks about how great this drawer unit is because its made of real wood, not particle board. Okay, yes, its real wood. I give them that. But get ready - its a real hassle to build it (unless you have a DRILL which we don't). It took us two hours, using a Philips head screwdriver and by the time I was finished, my hands and arms were really sore! The worst of it is, the bottoms of the drawers have no lock pins, nor does the manufacturer provide ""brads"" or even small nails to secure the drawer bottoms at the back, so they simply are free to slide out of the little ""grooves"" provided for them. See the pic attached. As a temporary fix, I put a piece of gaffers tape across the bottom to keep the drawer bottom from sliding out. Next step - going to Home Depot to get some small industrial staples or small nails so I can ""jerry-rig"" this thing, and take the gaffers tape off. All in all, this one issue is INFURIATING: it simply means this a STUPID/INEPT DESIGN, and extremely CARELESS ENGINEERING by the manufacturer. If they included little staples or extra nails to hammer in to hold the drawer bottoms in place, I would have given this a 4 star review. I hope the manufacturer actually reads this, as its a situation that could be easily remedied.",0,0
R2V92GVWA2ISRN,"When buying a replacement cartridge there is only really one thing that matters: whether it works or not.  This one does not.  I see many people have reported success with this cartridge, but the one I got was a mess, and I'm lucky it didn't ruin my printer.  It leaked toner all over the inside of the printer, printed large 1"" thick black lines down each page, and was just a total failure.  It was installed into a once-used official Brother toner carrier.  If you judge by the star ratings, this has 4 stars.  That means a lot of people are lucky enough to get a good one.  So if you buy this product, what is the chance yours will be a failure?  Making some simplifying assumptions, that 1-star reviews are failures, and 5-star reviews are good, there is a 25% chance yours will be a dud.  Maybe look somewhere else.",0,0

I may have gotten a little carried away buying a package of 12 pens I would not spend the money on trying to return.These pens are useless to me since my first pen is blotting after hardly any use.  I prefer a fine point, am not fussy about blue or black, but a pen that blots is useless to me.  I do not want to sign a letter or card only to have my pen blot.

Was hoping it would function like other customers had stated, but it streaked immedieatly from the outset.  This is such a POOR product that is not worth spending your time or money to buy.  Spend your $15 on somewhere else.  Evidently, you are buying a ""re-furbished"" cartridge that only has new toner in it and cannot be expected to function well enough to print normally.  Considering it functioned so poorly, I would recommend buying a refurbished cartridge for about $37 from LDProducts -- like I have from the past.  At least LDP guarantees that your replacement cartridge will function properly or you get a replacement.  I made the mistake of thinking I could buy one for half the price, but got STUNG.

RMOUWZBOM7ALV,"I was really upset when I received my item in a beat-up box where the paper cutter handle was exposed and was just hanging by a thread with the tape around it. It was not very pleasing to the eyes. I bought this cutter because of the reviews and the price. Sometimes, it's better to pay more to have fewer headaches.Some of my thoughts...1. The box that it came in was beat-up. It was the original box but come on, it was ripped everywhere.2. There was a clinging sound inside. A tiny piece broke off (probably from the shipping) when I was trying to take off the tape to open the box.3. The locking mechanism was broken. When I finally got all of the tapes around the box, that handle with a freaking sharp edge just popped open on my face. That was a little something. There's no way for me to lock it in place either.  So it just stayed lifted. Not safe at all.4. The handle is already chipped and the adjustable backstop was fractured (plastic material).5. The paper cutter was sharp and lightweight but I guess you will have to put some weight when you try to cut papers and make sure it's on a flat open space area for safety.6. It was a perfect size for home-use. It wasn't too big or small to just do normal document or paper cuttings.I contacted Amazon to return my item and finally, on the 3rd day the company reached out to me. I appreciated their response and they seemed genuine about their feedback. Just sad I can't use the cutter and will have to find something else.",0,0
R2KB74VSWKW1I3,"Out of every single purchase I have ever made on Amazon, I have never had a single bad experience except with this product. It doesn't even come close to working as it should. I started by testing it out with 50 clean pennies I COUNTED ahead of time. The coins were not properly sorted, the pennies went into the nickel slot AND penny slot, the machine jammed (from only 50 pennies...come on). The wrapper also filled up before the pennies were even full so that you can't even trust the count. Already I was working with a piece of garbage product, but I decided to throw in a bunch of coins and see what it did with them. It immediately jammed (again these are clean, newish coins) and wouldn't fix itself as advertised. So I then had to figure out how to remove the jam. But there is NO WAY TO TAKE APART ANY OF THE PIECES. You can't separate the overflow tray, you can't lift the lid entirely off, you cant take out the whole sorter to remove the jam. I had coins going down into the power supply area, coins jammed in places you couldn't reach, I ended up having to take the whole thing upside down and shaking it until most of the coins fell out, then I had to detach the back panel which, again, DOESN""T detach all the way and fish around for all the coins that fell back there.

At first I thought the initial pencil I tried to sharpen just had really broken up lead inside, but after trying it on multiple pencils I realized it was the doing of the sharpener. Other than that, I really disliked that it was just one of your typical hand held pencil sharpeners attached to a motor. I didn't think about it before purchasing, but after trying to use it, all of those broken pencil tips had to be removed by hand. In other words, after each attempt I had to open it up and use a toothpick to push the broken tip back out. SO annoying!!! Do yourself a favor and buy something different.",0,0

I purchased the printer that these labels go to from Amazon and went through approximately 5 or 6 rolls of this refill product, also ordered from Amazon, when suddenly, without any explanation, Amazon informed me there was a ""slight problem"" with my order--namely that I had exceeded my limit.  The computer then automatically changed my order to ""0.""  Examine this item's page closely, do you see a limit?  I assumed there must be a computer glitch, so I left my order in my shopping cart to try another day.  Not long afterwards, I received a message from Amazon that the price had dropped, as an encouragement to order, I assume.  But no, just like the last time, there was a ""slight problem"" with my order.  I would have to abide by my limit (again, what limit?) and again only order ""0"" copies of this item.  When I inquired with Amazon, both in phone calls and emails, I have learned ""so that more people can enjoy this product"" Amazon is limiting purchases.  Translation, you are welcome to buy the printer, but don't expect Amazon to sell you refills, so that ""more people can enjoy this product.""

However for the price I paid for the item and shipping it wasn't worth it. I feel that an item of this price should have at least been packaged and sent to look like New when it arrives. It arrived looking as though I have been carrying it in the back of a pickup truck for awhile.So I have this item a low rating because of the lousy shipping. The item itself is a very good product if you don't Mind scratches and dings when it arrives,0,0

RS3ZZKEBEQNF8,"I love the  Prismacolor Premier Illustration Markers, Brush Tip, Set of 8 Assorted Colors  (1736674)  ones by Prismacolor, but they didn't have the expanded color palette I needed. So I branched out and got these double-ended ones. I did NOT like them at all.For clarification, I am NOT an artist - this review is solely based on my use of them for Adult Coloring Books. Specifically, the  Secret Garden: An Inky Treasure Hunt and Coloring Book .BUT, I do NOT like the Double Tipped Markers. I DID like that these markers come in TONS of colors. I even went and bought some that were the single markers just to get some extra colors - like the light blue in the photo. Unfortunately, they don't write/draw/color at all like the 'brush tips;' which are awesome. These are firm and clumsy for fine detail coloring. Additionally, I didn't like the thickness of these in my hand - they're really wide.Most importantly, I was SO DISAPPOINTED to realize these big fat markers by Prismacolor BLEED. On one page, I used all brush tip markers EXCEPT for some spots of light blue. It was a lighter color than all the others, and made by the same company, so surely (I thought) it wouldn't bleed. It did - see photos. The first photos are a page colored with the standard brush tips by Prismacolor. They didn't bleed. I used ONE of the Double-Ended Brush Tips (THIS type of marker), the light blue, and it DID bleed. The owl image is the backside of that same page. So sad. I hope this review is helpful to others considering these markers for the same purpose. Now, if you're an artist or designer, you may have a completely different experience. I found these inferior to the single-ended brush tip markers by Prismacolor... (Those are shown in the last two photos)",0,0

It appeared easy enough to clip onto a carabiner that was attached to the chest location of my backpack strap.  The pen is constructed very solidly and writes just like any ballpoint pen.  You simply tug it to detach it for use.  But the one MAJOR flaw is that the pen can accidentally detach very easily at the clip.  If it does that on its own, you'll lose your $15 pen (the most I have ever paid for one pen).  I gave this a 2nd chance, in fact, and it fell down the same fate.  Two pens lost on two races = one star.",0,0

As the protective wrap is clear, you will probably not be able to see where the double sided tape begins and where the wrap ends, so you will just have to touch the top of the tape to make sure you have both sides of the adhesive exposed. This protective wrap is not included in the listed dimensions of the tape, the tape length starts from the point where the protective wrap ends.""I can't review any other aspects as I haven't used it yet, but the omission of this valuable info might keep you from giving up on it. . . as I nearly did.",0,0
RWEMOHT2D4UXP,"This pen was bought to replace a favorite pen that was ""nicked"" from me during a trade show.  I looked at the reviews and I noticed that a minority of reviews strongly stated how the quality has gone down hill.  They were right.  In direct comparison - The plastic in the old pens was robust and had a good feel to it.  Now the walls are so thin that I can feel them flex a bit if I squeeze.  Shine used to be deep and lustrous much like those hand rubbed finishes on cars.  Now it is flat with minimal gloss.  The metal tip used to have a shiny finish - now not so much. It has the feel of cheap promotional pens with a thin metal top. The overall finish reminds me of old Soviet Block products.  Believe me, I could go on.  Since I sprung for an unusual color - the pen cost me $10 through Amazon Prime.  I feel the pen is worth $3-5",0,0

R236B2HCCBQ70A,"Perhaps the Optima we got is defective, though I can find nothing physically wrong with it (or the packaging). Even with the Swingline 40 staples which are supposed to staple as many as 40 pages, the best we could do was 26 pages, and the points do not bend over to make a smooth underside. In other words, you can get stuck on the points of the staples.When stapling two or three sheets, it's hit or miss. Sometimes, it performs adequately. At other times, one end of the staple is crumpled.Last, even for 25 pages, it takes some effort to get the staples to go through.I've been using Swingline products for decades, and I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and say that this one is a dud. It's going back, but I will not replace it with the same model.(Why two stars? Simply, reviews with one star are usually dismissed and not read because the reviewer is seen as disgruntled and without objectivity. So, two stars just to get you to read this.

R1UZHSJ8XTG2U1,"Nice design aesthetically, and the built-in handle is nice.  But it only has two heat settings, one for 3mil and one for 5mil pouches.  I set it for 5mil and waited for it to signal it was ready, then ran through several Fellowes brand 5mil pouches (1 sheet of 20lb bond in pouch).  They all came out wavy and distorted, a symptom that points to the heat being too high.I reset it to the 3mil setting and waited for it to cool down and beep its ready signal.  I again tried a 5mil pouch (at the 3mil setting).  Much better, almost acceptable but still some waves.  Tried a 3mil pouch and it came out very wavy -- I would call it rippled.  No way to reduce heat any further since the machine only has two settings.  Apparently this machine just runs hot!Other issues...  There were minor scratches on the front panel (this panel is completely protected during shipping, so it had to come out of the factory that way).  Also, every few minutes the normal ""humming"" sound would change to a loud ""buzzing"" noise for several seconds (another reviewer complained of this too, so it isn't just this one).I returned the SL95 to Amazon and purchased a GBC H212 instead.

Content is great, typical Brendon style with great thought provoking questions each day.  The 60 days does not bother me, these type of productivity/thinking planners typically are not a full year so that was not a surprise.  So a good idea, but....The layout and the size is what I cannot get past.  For size, it is a large (8.5x11) hard back book.  The layout and space is awkward to write in.  It also has your thoughtful insite for the day right there with your schedule so if you pull out your book to make a note on your schedule or see what is next it is there for everyone to see.Personally, I would rework it.  Size should be about 1/2 what it is (maybe 8.5x5) and perhaps the layout should be broken up to two sections for each day.  I would like to see the top portion and schedule on two pages with the morning and evening mindset and daily habits scorecard on the next two pages so they are more private if you were to use in an office setting.

Updating review to 1 star, and would give 0 stars if possible. Look elsewhere for a sturdier compass that comes with all pieces as advertised.Upon receipt it appears we (possibly) received a used item as there were markings on the interior packaging, and there was no extra lead as indicated on the item description. The compass is very lightweight, and tends to “slip” frequently during use. I intentionally chose this compass as it was packaged separately (rather than a set), and quality appeared to be better than the type with mini-pencils inserted in product images. Overall, I would give this product a solid mid-range review. It’s unfortunate that it is not heavier, and that we did not receive the extra lead.

Unfortunately, I did not test it when I first received the cartridges and waited until I was actually out of ink, which meant I missed my window of opportunity to return.  In my case this great price turned out to be quite expensive.  Not getting it returned in time is my own fault.

This is amplified if you have a 17"" laptop, because on my 17"" at least 3-4"" of it is hanging over the back of the ""desK"". Now add to this the fact that this is exactly where your weight is, due to the screen connecting and sitting upright exactly over the area with no support. My laptop had fallen off the back of this thing with the littlest amount of movement, especially if I have the screen angled back at all, then it's just waiting to do a back flip off this thing.

RHWCG2JRYU153,"After installing the new toner, the printer would almost print one sheet, but then report a ""jam inside."" The jam was not inside though - the paper had gone through the fuser but wasn't delivered to the output tray. I see this problem was reported by several other users. Additionally the printer would tell me there was a jam inside even after removing the paper, but re-seating the drum unit a few times cleared the fault - until the next sheet :-(After pulling out much of my remaining hair, I came up with a temporary workaround. By running the printer with the cover open (a matchstick can be used to defeat the front cover interlock) I determined that lifting the rear of the drum unit solved the intermittent ""Jam Inside"" problem.Poking a matchstick under each side of the drum unit to raise it up allowed printing to continue. I'll look for a more permanent solution and will edit my review when I find one.In the meantime I'm back in business, though this cost me an hour, so I'm not very happy!I hope the workaround may be useful to others who haven't yet returned their cartridges.Update 24 hours later - the matchstick trick worked well. To make it a little more permanent, I flipped over the drum unit/toner carrier, and taped half a matchstick to the rear outside corners on the underside. It is enough to lift the drum unit slightly when inserted, and solves the problem. (The toner still only gets 2 stars!)",0,0

It made printing large docs very time consuming and the paper wouldn't sit flat or stack cleanly at all.  So I did a test.  I printed a 400 page document with the GP paper. I use a brother mfc 8460.  Every six or seven sheets I either had to pull the sheet or push it down.  I had to continuously monitor the production to avoid a jam.  Then I put in Hammermill Copy paper to print a second copy of the same document.  The Hammermill worked perfectly.  So perfectly, that I could write this review while it was priting.  No problem.  The Hammermill paper came out flat and stacked neatly.  This GP paper is garbage compared to Hammermill and I will never, ever purchase GP copy paper again.  I watch for sales and usually get a box of Hammermill for around $30 on sale.  Even if it wasn't, and the GP paper was a little cheaper I would not buy it.  Frankly, I was amazed at the difference.

R3UNTEPPETOETQ,"Here's what I like about it---it was very, very, very, very quick and easy to put together---no tools required---great design---took 60 seconds. 5 stars for that.But I'm finding it to be a really frustrating cart to use for my purposes---it's probably fine if you live in a civilized city with very smooth sidewalks, but it's nearly useless to me here in Taos, New Mexico---it doesn't move well over any type of bump, crack, curb---God forbid gravel.  I gave some thought to whether I was being too critical of it---I checked the price again to see what I paid and decided no, I'm not being too critical, for that price, it should be a little bit more tough and capable.  I've owned a lot of wheely carts and this one is the most frustrating one I've had.  I think the problem might have to do with the little flexible front wheels, but I'm not sure.",0,0
R3W108YUBX0E2Z,"These are adorable and remind me of tsum tsums and/or Piglet. I gave them 2 stars because they are definetly aesthetically pleasing and would look nice displayed in a stationary holder. The pig motif itself it a nice hard rubber with good details. I was able to find these cheaper elsewhere as well.As a pen, they were barely functional and I returned them since I bought them as favors and don't think guests would want or use them after leaving. They wrote okay, but had a cheaper needlepoint type tip I didn't really like and I'd expect the ink runs out quickly. They feel light and cheap as well. I had a difficult time taking the caps off, but once removed they either still went on super tight or basically fell off. Some reciepents were going to be schoolchildren who I feel would get very frustrated using them despite looking cool.",0,0

R3USWAVHZCMZMD,"Absolute piece of junk.  The first one I bought from Staples about two years ago.  I use it to close bags of potatoes (which means it is only going through about five sheets of paper) but after two years (only two boxes of staples) it broke.  Would not finish the stapling process, the final click to close the staple would not happen no matter how hard you squeezed.  I bought a replacement here at Amazon, and after opening the box, the replacement will not staple, just clogs and jams.  Even when going through one sheet of paper.  Swingline makes their staplers in China now, they definitely don't care about their product name or reputation anymore.Well, after returning the product and having a replacement sent to me from Amazon I thought I would edit my review.  The new one worked much better than the first.  The first one would not staple at all, the replacement worked for an amazing run of 5 STAPLES before it broke!  I guess improvement comes in small steps.  I returned this one, but not for a replacement, I am getting my money back...  Amazon should not disgrace themselves by offering such a horrible product on their website.  If anyone here needs four boxes of overpriced special staples that this thing takes, I have them.",0,0

This stapler worked wonderfully on two 50 page documents, then died. On the third 50 pager the staples jammed. I cleared it. It jammed again. I am very mechanically talented. I could not fix it. I sent it back and purchased a different stapler, also made by Swingline  Swingline High Capacity Desk Stapler, Reduced Effort, 60 Sheets, Black (S7077701)  but advertised to work for 60 page documents.

After a few years my scale started not going back to zero, and flickering up to .05 ounces which I have to account for each time, and only rarely goes back to 0 if you keep on messing with it which is very time consuming. But on start it is always over 0, and with no weight or dirt on top. I emailed the company several times about getting a new one and they never replied. So the lifetime warranty is a lie beware. If your scale breaks you will need to just buy a new one. Horrible customer service, or I should ZERO customer service. The scale does work still but always has that reset issue.",0,0

R2PSYHEQQ9HW1A,"I have never seen anything like this in my life;even with the cheapest of off market printer inks. One was leaking in the package. Another, the locking tab was missing. But worst of all, following their directions and those on my HP printer, every single cartridge leaked profusely. I don't mean just smears, but large drops. The ink was all over my hands, the printer, the printer stand and the rug below.Making things even worse, the black cartridge did not fit correctly. It had to be forced into the ink head.Think I am exaggerating?

R5Y2G24864IJB,"Let me tell you about #1 Best Scale. It is heavy which was impressive. That is the reason I bought it. However, after one week of use when you turn it on you simply get a blank screen. No matter what you do, no matter what buttons you push, it remains blank. So, you have to unplug the head from the power cord and re-plug it back in and the thing works. So no, I don't want to have to power my unit up twice each time I wish to use it.  The only reason I did not give it one start instead of two is that it is heavy and appears to be a solid scale once you get power to it. But since there are serious issues with it and it obviously was not tested from the ultra-fast production line in China that never tests anything, 2 stars is it. I returned mine and will go with a more respectable brand. Don't waste your money on this.",0,0

R36HAS8LV5Y9L5,"The 8570 prints gorgeous pictures, but when it breaks, it breaks permanently. We have gone through five 8570’s over the past 4 years, with each of them experiencing what I would consider low to moderate print volume. Before these 8570’s we went through several 8550’s which are basically the same printer, all with the same type of unrepairable mechanical failures. These solid ink printers are a reliability nightmare with their only saving grace being that fantastic print quality.I’m finally writing this review because I just had to decommission yet another broken 8570 (this one was 3 years and 2 months old), and I replaced it instead with a HP Color Laserjet that is more reliable and with cheaper supplies - even though the prints don’t look as good as the 8570.Most of our 8570’s end up dying after 3 years with a Print Head failure. We tried to repair them the first couple of times that they died, just to find out the cost of the repair exceeds the cost of a new printer by a few hundred dollars. So we bought new printers and trashed the old ones as they died off.Why keep buying printers that break so often? The artists love the print quality, and the ink is useless to any other device and an investment in it’s own right. Colors are vibrant, lines are sharp, they’re fairly easy to network, and they work fine on Macs and PCs. They weigh a ton but they’re not very loud. Even though it costs about $250 to get a full ink supply – yes, close to half the price of the printer - the ink does seem to last a while although it has a tendency to melt itself needlessly (as part of it’s cleaning process) if you don’t use the printer for extended periods of time.That’s the main reason we’ve kept replacing them with new 8570’s. It’s so wasteful but you’re stuck with the supplies and the clients love the prints.Ink is ridiculously expensive and difficult to find, so if you run out you can’t stop by your neighborhood Office Max to grab more. You basically always have to mail order ink. Generally, the 8570’s day to day reliability is fine. It doesn’t randomly reboot itself, it wakes up from sleep mode quickly, and has a web interface to change it’s settings.Just be aware that when it develops a hardware problem, it leaves you dead in the water and there’s no way to repair it without throwing good money after bad. Maintenance Kit is about $110 and you’ll need to get at least one before your printer dies in the next three years.We have only a couple 8570’s left in the office and with luck, we’ll get through enough of that expensive ink before those remaining printers die. We will not be purchasing any more ColorQubes and are basically just waiting for the remaining ones to die off, which at this rate will be a few months after their factory warranty expires.",0,0
R1OKUKQ3ZWSNLV,"The other reviewers were right - the pens fall off the caps before I even get to use the pens! The ball-chain clasps are nice and tight, but without the pens, what's the use? Also, yes, all inks are black. Don't waste your money.",0,0
RUQPTPPT767HF,"I originally gave these pencils 4 stars. After using at least 10 of them, I am reducing g the rating to 2 stars.  The lead inside is broken, so when you sharpen, pieces of it come out causing you to have to sharpen sometimes a quarter inch of pencil to get a new point.  Every pencil has this issue.  Despite this, they write well when the lead is sturdy. Other issue is the end with white plastic requires my electric heavy duty pencil sharpener to get past the plastic.  Sharpen easier once past the 1st inch.  Eraser is great! Would rate much higher if so much lead wasn’t wasted.",0,0
R3E88F41YRL4VO,"So here is the real deal. All the bad reviews are because the product is fake. The one on the left is an actual Xacto. The one on the right is a cheap knock off. The blade holder on the authentic one keeps the blade lined up on the sliding mechinism. So when you tighten it down the blade stays locked in the correct orientation. The parts are all different in small ways, but the difference is a great product vs a cheap one that isn't even useable. It's sloppy, loose, and the blade ends up pointing sideways in the handle once tightened. If you look closely all the parts are slightly different. It comes in near perfect packaging too. So if you've never had the real one, you'd think xacto just made a piece of junk. The real one is awesome. I've had 50 different handles for craft knives in the last 40+ years. If you can get the real one, do. This one isn't it.",0,0

R2ZK249VU8EKQ7,"I do not recommend this product because of a few reasons. I bought this to help me in and out of bed yet it scare me to use it. Half the time when I try to use it to get into bed or get out of bed the stool will collapse on my. Another issue I found is that it sounds like is going to break any minute and I see the sides start to fold in some times when I hear the noises. This product is rated for 300 lbs and I am only 268 lbs so it should not be behaving this way unless the 300 lbs rating is a lie but I am unable to prove it will hold 300 lbs because I do not want to break it until I find another solution and more sturdier stool.As comparison my wife has a stool in the kitchen that she purchased many years ago, same style and also made of plastic like this one ans that one never makes any noises like is going to break and that one has never collapsed on me while trying to use it.one last note I had this device for a few months I really waited to review so I did it justice and made sure it was not just me being picky.",0,0
REUMC84JITLQ0,"Didn't work in my printer. It let me have hope for the minutes it took to try and calibrate my printer head. Granted, I have an older printer- two actually. One the newer version that had wifi so my dad bought it for me. Two great Kodak printers that have been used maybe 10 times each. I saw this deal and said oh yeah! Here's my money!!! I received the ink quickly- totally will give the seller that. But, didn't have use for the ink until last week when I was trying to print the Christmas pictures. The printer frankly loaded with one of each type. Black and color. The printer tried to start and when I asked it to calibrate it said it didn't recognize the cartridge. Lesson learned. Just go spend the 40 on Kodak ink or load these cartridges immediately and test them out. It's been so long since the purchase I have no clue if a refund or replacement is possible. Just be careful.

R30QXM8XENCFQ8,"The good: Great flow, fantastic colorThe bad: Not nearly as permanent as other Noodler's inksAfter being astounded by the quality (and permanence) of Noodler's Bulletproof Black, I was looking for a similar permanent blue ink to complement it, and decided to try Bad Belted Kingfisher. It's a good ink with amazing color, but lacks the staying power I was looking for. In water, a good amount of it runs and washes away. Other reviews claim that this smearing behavior is a ""security feature"", but Noodler's Black doesn't smear at all after it dries. When exposed to bleach or peroxide, Kingfisher fades a great deal. The remaining marks are still legible, but leave much to be desired.I returned Kingfisher and replaced it with Bad Blue Heron, with which I am much more impressed.",0,0

R1YO7736HWXUOA,"After breathing a lot of extra ozone from my laser printer, I decided to write a quick review about this product to warn others.  The paper will not load into the printer feeder and I have to try over an over until I get the right number of sheet in the hopper, take out and re-load, etc.  I have had my Samsung ML-1430 laser printer for almost a decade and it has been great, now with this paper, it will not load into the printer.  Maybe I was using 24lb before and this is too light, but I assumed ""copy and print"" meant it was general use.  Anyway, very frustrating as printing is now a nightmare.  If you have a laser printer, consider spending a few extra bucks on some heavier paper (just my guess at the problem).",0,0

I tried the service and figured out that was not for me; but then I had a very hard time cancelling the service. To understand what some of the problems are, I suggest that you google ""how to cancel service for ooma"" to see what kind of problems people have and that this is a problem for a number of people.  In general, the bad parts are:1. you cannot cancel on-line.2. You get a runaround when you call.3. It takes a long time on the phone to cancel.4. They push this idea of giving you a transfer number so that if you sell the device, the person will not have to pay activation fees.  The catch is, if you don't sell it, you get charged for all those months.  They are not very clear about that part.I'd give it a higher rating, as the service seems fine, but I felt like they were trying to trick me and cheat me.Also for the price that has standard features, you might as well get a cell phone from someplace like Republic Wireless that uses WiFi when you are connected, but uses the sprint network otherwise.

R21SR5X1M8ZLDP,"I much prefer the other water brushes I've tried, which are Derwent and Pentel.  They work well and the mechanism is intuitive.  Simply squeeze the soft ergonomic barrel to release water to clean the brush or paint.  The more you squeeze the more water comes out.  it's child's play.  It takes seconds to figure out how much squeezing is necessary.  Filling is a doddle too as you simply unscrew the brush on top and pour water into the barrel, very convenient for filling when out and about plus they hold lots of water so filling is not required often.  With the caps on I've carried these things here and there in a pencil case in my bag for years and never once had an issue with leaking.This Caran D'Ache water pen is a totally different animal.  It looks much more stylish granted and the brand name is known for high end quality so you might be fooled into thinking the product would be better, but think again.The filling mechanism is more trouble than it's worth and the click click method of applying water is a hassle. It's a case of click click click this will take me forever with the amount I need, click oh no, too much and then  I'm trying desperately to get rid of a big blog before it drops on my painting, too late!You literally have to stop painting while you do this clicking process with thumb and index finger also, and the buttons aren't necessarily in the position you would normally be holding the brush either so you have to rearrange your hand each time or permanently paint in an uncomfortable position.Cleaning between colours is an issue also.  With the other brands you can squeeze water out with one or two squeezes that will flush the paint out of the brush, so you have a clean brush between washes.  The Caran D'Ache is not so simple.  With the click click click method of drips you don't get the flush that cleans, instead you get drips that leave you with a dirty brush to use for the next wash.All in all, I would love to give a good review for such an ordinarily high quality brand, but this product has no redeeming features.

However, there is a sticker on the front of the turquoise colored stool that very clearly says for up to 320 lbs, NOT 400 as advertised.  NOTE THIS IS FOR SITTING, not for standing on the stool. I wouldn't even let a child stand on this stool!  The ""hinges"" are not held with any kind of plastic or metal pins. Instead, they just snap together and hold with small plastic ""bumps."" Therefore, the stool can completely come apart under weight - and will collapse if you are sitting, or, heaven forbid, standing on it when this happens - very dangerous!  Also, the ""non-skid"" foam dots on the top surface are not especially effective because they are recessed slightly, so although they might provide some slip protection, this would only work if they were exposed so they would make contact with whatever is on top of the stool.

Not really a big problem until I tried to erase the color.  I did wait a full 5 minutes for the color to dry then I tried erasing with the highlighter eraser and it was gummy and thick and difficult to remove.  I was able to take my damp Rocketbook cloth to wipe it clean away (all of it) but I find it difficult to lift the color off if I only make a small mistake vs erasing the whole page or larger section with a damp cloth.I thought maybe it was maybe the Rocketbook paper so I figured that I could still use them for my disk planner since I use highlighters in it often and if appointments got canceled or rescheduled then I could just erase the highlighter and pens (I use the FriXion gel pens for my planner) and erase it all.  I had the same issue in my disk planner.  tried it on a variety of different types of paper (notebook, printer, cardstock, heavy) and I found I have the same problem with all of them which is disappointing.  On top of that, some of the color doesn't lift out and leaves a faint coloring on the paper (not in my Rocketbook).

R2CII92OWL66C4,"Very much unlike Brendon Burchard to put out an incomplete/inefficient product. Brendon usually puts out super high quality stuff. I was surprised by this planner.  The first thing is that there was nothing mentioned on morning ritual. This is a very high priority for Brendon, yet it is absent here. I would have expected at least one page of morning ritual suggestions and guidelines and a spot to put these in the planner. Next I see a weekly review and a monthly review. You see these a lot with all kinds of productivity mavens.  Don't plan weekly AND monthly. Then you end up spending a lot of time doing two review session near the end of the month. It is way more productive to only do weekly reviews. Then when you want to summarize how you are progressing you can choose to take a 4 or 8 or 12 week period or any other period that works for you and review that and see your trends in the categories that matter to you. I changed the whole thing around to fit for me and put it all on a google sheet going forwards week by week for years to come.The main thing is intent (clarity) and the the follow up on that intent by producing on that intent and not other stuff. You can get that from the planner but you do not need this many questions at the beginning and at the end of the day.So while it is not necessarily a 1 star it just took me by surprise that this planner is far less informational and usable than I would have expected coming from BB. his fans will give it an unconditional 5 star but it is not up to par. BB sorry you need to get back to the drawing board on this one despite three years of working on it. I understand it needs to be generic for it to work for everybody but it could be more streamlined and more time efficient. You have to get to the key point fast and drive those. You also need a way to set aside all the distractions.  I keep an area to write down a one or two word note about a distraction item and then I put is away knowing it is written down and I can forget about it until I have excess time to go after some of the minor unimportant non-time sensitive details. LATER is powerful. NOW is even more powerful but only if these are your MAIN priorities. This planner won't get you there efficiently.",0,0

R3O6FYVQUPFYSC,"When I first got the dry erase board, I wasn't impressed.  The letters on the days were already faded and the cork board had several ""bubbles"" in it where it looked like it hadn't been glued to the backing.  Also, one of the round magnets (with the plastic covering you use on the board) did not stick to its plastic backing.  But whatever, I was going to use it anyways.After reading all the other reviews about the poor adhesive on the backing magnets (to stick to your fridge), I decided to super glue the magnets to the back.  HUGE MISTAKE!!!  Now, I'm not blaming anyone but myself for this error - I should have researched a proper glue to use on the back.  I just want to share my experience so it doesn't happen to anyone else.  Well I must have put too much glue or should have used a different glue, because the glue had a chemical reaction to my refrigerator.  Seriously!?!?  I had let the glue dry for at least an hour before putting the board on my fridge. I don't know, I had cleaned the fridge before putting the board on - maybe the glue had a reaction to the chemicals in the cleaner - even though I let both of them dry first?  I'm not sure.  Anyways, my black fridge now has 4 areas where the magnets were that are white (the magnets left rectangle markings).  It looks horrible!  Again, not blaming anyone but myself.  If you are going to glue the magnets to the back, DON'T USE SUPERGLUE.  Find another adhesive.  Anyways, all is not lost - we were planning on replacing the refrigerator this fall anyway and my husband jokes that I sabotaged our fridge on purpose to ensure I would get a new one...lol.Because I glued the magnets on the back and had that horrible reaction, into the garbage it went.  It didn't even last 1 day.",0,0

R6VRVJ11KNVKC,"If not for this one big thing, it would be 5 stars++.Be advised. This printer seems like it is a good deal because it comes with a 3000 page ink supply. But BEWARE this ink EXPIRES and is extremely expensive. There is no warning or indication that the included inks EXPIRE.Make no mistake. This printer makes amazing prints. But I am a low volume home user. The printer comes with a '3000' page supply of ink. We print maybe 500 pages / year. We have now owned this printer for about 2 years and have partially consumed about 3/4 of a block of each ink. However, the printer has recently started complaining that there is incompatible ink. I checked this out and was advised that it expired. I spent $600 and bought a set of new ink blocks. I removed the unused blocks (all 4 colors). These cannot be reinserted as is complains that they are expired. Looking at the blocks, there is a different pattern in the 'bumps' that seem to be labeled A thru D.Not to mention that I now have to dispose of my unused ink blocks (4 of them - about $200 worth). And not exactly environmentally friendly and no waste.I hope the new blocks do not 'expire'.If you print >3000 pages/year this is a great deal. For a low volume home user, this is expensive, especially if the regular bought ink also expires. But, if you want the absolutely best print quality you can get. Go for it.

I tried everything from being tougher on it, gentle, and pressed harder so that the letters would make strong indentation into the ink pad, but nothing works. If they had made the ink pad thicker perhaps this wouldn't be a problem? Who knows.

ROOSOKCRMO3RY,"Love my MFC 9970CDW but when it's come to getting replacement toner there's a real problem.  I ordered this toner (gts value pack) based on other reviews but three of the four cartridges leaked and have totally messed up my printer.  (Also, the cleanup is messy and if you're not careful you'll end up breathing in toner ink dust.) I was hoping that these would be as good as Brother toner, which is very expensive. But the replacement toner sold by ""great toners"" is no solution. No reputable company would have such poor quality control and I don't know why Amazon would continue to give this company access to their customer base. After many many orders to Amazon over the years, this is my FIRST negative experience.Note another problem with replacement toner in general:  the MFC is programmed to constantly display a ""low toner"" message if you've installed a non-Brother toner - a real irritant and bad business practice.  This programmed feature is to  force MFC owners to give up on non-Brother toners and just buy Big Brother.

R21D7DZEPWP3UK,I've always known Bostitch as a good brand to say the least. I have to say they really disappoint with this product. First of all when I opened the box and inspected the sharpener I saw wood filings in the cutter. I don't know if they test them first or this was a used and returned item. I'm not giving to stars based on that issue. I'm being generous with two stars based on the price. This sharpener bogs down with the slightest pressure. You have to barely push down to keep it going otherwise it will stop. It also sharpens one side of the pencil leaving the other side covered with wood. As a mechanical person I can tell you it has a cheap weak motor similar to the ones found in cheap toys. I will keep this for now because I really can't be bothered returning things. Please trust me don't go by these other 5 star reviews. Save your money buy a better one.,0,0
R7TG3UL3HIXGU,"I purchased this scale to help with eBay and also for those letters that you aren't sure if they need extra postage or not.

They weighed it and said it was fine with one stamp. It weighed 0.7 oz and I didn't need extra postage! What good is this scale if I still have to go to the post office to verify the weight.So I pulled out the instructions and I was relieved (for a short while) that there was a way to calibrate it. You push some button combinations and then put on the 30 lb 0.1 oz weight. That will calibrate it. But wait. Where do I get a 30lb 0.1 oz weight?!?

I went in to look at reviews and sure enough, everyone was having the problem.  So, I decided to ask for a refund and find somewhere else to buy new ink from.  I went to Walmart and still leary that the ink cartridges might be defective based on reviews I had read on Amazon, Walmart and Office Depot sites.  Bought the new ink from Walmart anyways.  Came home, installed them and a message came up telling me I had just installed genuine HP cartridges.  I did not get that message when I installed the ink cartridges I purchased from Amazon.

RRAJK9LO9A55R,"Not at all impressed. I purchased this due to the overwhelming positive reviews on Amazon. Took it out of the box, loaded the included staples (made sure none were loose) and attempted to staple a stack of 40 sheets of paper. 5 out of 7 attempts resulted in bent staples that didn't go all the way through the 40 sheets. Part of the staple would be jammed in the stapler and part would be jammed in the stack of paper, leaving me trying to separate the stack of papers from the stapler.Not sure if I got a dud or how so many other people had a positive experience, but I've had it less than 10 minutes and it's frustrated me enough to prompt this review.

R2AJ6AC54NNPQG,"Pillow feels hard and can't determine exactly how to sit in it. When sitting all the way back it cups the glutes in weird way and when move more to the center of the pillow it doesn't allow lumbar spine to be protected by a chair. Coccyx pain a little better when sit in center though not as helpful when sit towards back of cushion. I find it rather high as well. Experiencing a significant increase in T-spine pain perhaps due to alignment/cushion design.  Orthopedic Surgeon recommended a memory foam cut out pillow and that seemed too hard so returned it for this one. My Physical Therapist suggested a donut hole, however most reviews on that indicate they are too wobbly and I need stability. Oh my tushie woes. Sitting for any length of time is excruciating on coccyx and I need to start sitting to build back some lumbar and T-spine muscles following surgery on sacroiliac I had 6 months ago. I am going to bring this pillow to my PT and get her thoughts. As far as helping coccyx, I feel it does help take pressure off, it just feels weird to have to sit in the middle with back unsupported.

Unfortunately, though, the scale is a huge pain to use: you place an item to be weighed, hit HOLD, then the ""shipper"" button to select the carrier, then the ""service"" button to indicate delivery type. Only then do you see the rate. It then requires three keystrokes to prepare to weigh another item, after which EACH of the steps above must be repeated since the settings aren't persistent from one weighing to the next. Bottom line: this scale is functional but not really useful; it's clear that the people who designed this don't actually ship packages very often, and that they didn't solicit feedback from anyone who does.",0,0

R27L53X89JGWCO,"I went ahead with an order for these peanuts though I was a bit concerned about one reviewer indicating he had received considerably less than advertised.  The order arrived quickly and I was very pleasantly surprised about the shipping.  Rather than being in a bag they were in a sturdy cardboard box.  The external size of the box was four cubic feet and it was jammed packed full of the peanuts.  Making allowance for the inside dimensions of the box, I still received a bit more than the 3.5 cubic feet indicated - there was definitely not a shortage.  Although the order said the seller's name was Bubblefast, the return address on the shipping label said TheBoxery.  Not sure what that means, but it might mean some regional affiliations to reduce shipping costs.  I live near Philadelphia and the shipping point was Ridgewood, NY.  Others in different regions may not receive the same type of package.Incidentally, I priced peanuts at a local office products store and they were over 2.5 times the cost.The above order was placed Nov-2013 and was definitely a five star experience, which is what I rated it at the time.  I placed a second order April-2014 supposedly for the same thing.  However, things were not the same.  This time a company called Starboxes filled the order from somewhere in Florida.  The package only contained 2-1/2 cubic feet instead of the 3-1/2 that was ordered.  And, that package was a flimsy bag instead of a sturdy box.  Because of the shortage, I changed the rating from five stars to one star.  I find it totally unacceptable for the order to be short by almost 30%.As a follow up note to the second purchase, I complained to the seller.  It took a several emails back and forth plus a picture of the bag as received, but they agreed to refund the prorata share for the missing amount.  The person I exchanged emails with stated that the picture showed the bag had come open at the top and some had spilled out.  I am a bit doubtful about that because adding another cubic foot to that bag probably would not allow it to be closed.As a result of the refund, I have upgraded my rating to two stars.  I at least got what I paid for on a unit basis, but the process of getting there was unsatisfactory.",0,0

RV7EW4RD02A5G,"Over the past 25 years I have used a number of different kinds of staplers. When Covid hit, I needed a high capacity stapler for home office use.  I chose the Swingline 70 sheet capacity one, and for about 9 months it worked fine.  I would say 70 sheets is pushing it, it prefers more like 50 - 60, and starts to show its less than robust design as you move towards its claimed capacity.  Setting that aside, the real flaw in the design relates to the impact plate which creates the fold in the staple after it drives through the paper to be stapled.  At some point about 9 months in, it just stopped  bending the staples correctly, and each and every staple was a jam, not in the usual sense.  The staple would be driven through, but then on the backside, the staple would not be folded in on itself. Instead it was just jammed straight back, usually breaking the staples in half.  Basically the stapler no longer works at all.  I am using the Swingline Optima staples.  I reached out to Swingline Customer support.  After week of not hearing back from them, I have decided to simply post this review.  Swingline had the opportunity to reply, but chose not to, after all it's a $33 item, and I am but a single customer.

R1EY43HXTO0ASF,"Pros:  I was impressed with the ease of putting the stand together.  All parts were well marked with small ABC labels - and the labels were either on the underside or in a place where you wouldn’t see them if you didn’t remove them once the unit was put together.  I think I checked every assembly point and from what I could tell, the stand only goes together one way and I really liked that.  There was very little verbiage on the instructions and it was almost all pictures (which isn’t really a pro or con).  The cart rolls really nicely.Cons:  The top is actually in 3 pieces and they do not completely meet because of the underneath supporting bracket.  More importantly, the supporting bracket does NOT hold the top level at all.  I saw that another reviewer suggested using washers and I tried that, but it’s still not level and I’m afraid that it I add more, the screws won't support the top.",0,0

After using this for a couple of weeks I have found some serious issues with it.  The ""C"" clamp that holds the compass together gets looser the more you use it and this causes the compass to become unstable when it is opened more than half way.  I was able to tighten the ""C"" clamp for now but this will be an issue throughout the life of the item.  The little screws that hold the the lead and needle in place also come undone very easily.  I am assuming this is why they give you extra dials.  They, however, do not give you extra screws for the dials.  I can no longer recommend this item after experiencing these flaws.",0,0

RSNYQSBDF193M,"I got this to replace an old thrift store Boston sharpener that finally stopped working, after allowing me to dissemble and service it a few times before it gave up the ghost.  This vertical Bostitch worked well for several months and could sharpen both standard and colored pencils. And the primary users were my kids. But then one day it quit working. And I tried to take it apart to service it for clogs, wax buildup, or whatever the problem was, but this thing was not made to be serviced or troubleshooted. It is what companies would call disposable. That was disappointing for me. I was hoping that with a little TLC, it would work again, but it's design makes that impossible. To replace it, today I paid about 30 for the X-acto School Pro. While it is not supposed to sharpen colored pencils, this model can handle different sizes of pencils AND is the company made it serviceable and refurbishable with replacement cutters. There are a couple of versions from Bostitch that have the option of having a replacement cutter that I seriously considered, including EPS10HC and EPS11HC. But based on reviews, I went with X-acto for a replacement for this vertical Bostitch. And after visiting with X-acto on the phone I learned that they will be releasing a new version of the School Pro and Teacher Pro that can handle colored pencils too.To get back to this sharpener it is inexpensive and works great UNTIL it doesn't work at all. If you have no qualms about not being able to unclog or service it on your own and are fine with buying a new one every so often, then this is good choice. But if you want to do some basic troubleshooting and have the option of replacement cutters, look elsewhere.",0,0

Of the one's I've used, 2 of them were dried out (or nearly dried out) and as such, the tips frayed when I tried to use them. And one of the green ones arrived with a frayed tip. So while that one has enough ink, I can't make smooth or thin lines. Then two more have dried up after using them a few times (so they weren't full).

R1ACPFYFM6SL7L,"If I had written about the Tdbest Highback Mesh Office Chair while I was attempting to assemble it or trying to decipher its operation I would tell any interested buyer to find another chair.  In fact I am still not certain that I have correctly attached the back to the seat or the headrest to the back,  or if I have the armrests on backwards – for some reason they wobble but they do that even if you reverse them.The horrible instruction sheet is good for a laugh and thankfully not representative of the overall engineering and workmanship.  The instructions consist of a single 12 x 8 inch sheet,  which is blank on the back.  The instructions are not so much written directions as crudely drawn illustrations each of which would need little reduction to be fit on a microdot.  The tiny font with part's names is too small to read without magnification.  Yet when you magnify the parts list you get the bad news that two washers on the list are missing,  there is an open spot in the shrink wrapped panel containing the other washers and bolts.  This is cause for alarm until you magnify the other six images and realize that it is impossible from the crude drawing to be sure exactly where these should be placed.The missing washers are easy to miss because they are simply taped inside the flap of the chair's cardboard box,  with no effort made to indicate that they can be found there.  If you logically concluded that they were purposely not included and assembled the chair without them you will later be faced with the exciting chore of using a rubber mallet to pound out the gas cylinder that fuses to the base when inserted.All that said,  the materials and craftsmanship appear first rate and the value is probably comparable to other chairs in this price range.  But I would check out the alternatives until they put some effort into improving the instructions and adopt a better packaging fix for the washers.",0,0

Giving this as a gift it was annoying when it only would recognize things (which it barely did) from my own voice versus my Mothers voice which it had an extremely hard time doing. The lists were ok but they never were that useful to be honest. Also it takes WAY MORE TIME to actually create a list than to write it down.The real reason why I give this a two star rating (and believe me that is generous) is because when you purchase this item it comes with batteries, and for a couple bucks more and so I thought piece of mind i bought the extended warranty. To my dismay the unit stopped working (reasons unknown) and the batteries that were included in the box leaked causing more concern. Upon calling the company to complain and try and get a replacement i find out that battery leakage is not covered by the warranty even if they supplied them, also the replacement fix fee was almost as much as the product to begin with.Needless to say Brookstone and there products lack quality and in my opinion are one heck of a scam company. Will never recommend or buy another product from there again! Do yourself a favor and write down your own lists and save the headache and money!",0,0

One plus of a new mouse mat after many years of good service with the old one was that it would look fresh and clean. It was clear this one was going to look rode hard and put away sweaty very quickly.The pad is a very thin lightweight foam-- it tracked well enough, but it is annoying in not just laying down flat right away. It might relax over time, but the under side where it did lay down near the wrist pad is not in any way sticky so it slides a bit too easily on a wood desk top for my taste.This is all probably just personal preferences-- can't say the product is defective in any way, so it might suit someone else very well.",0,0

It has a glitch in printing where the copies come out a jumbled mess of smudged print along the edges and completely white over about 85% of the center of the page.  I removed the cartridge and had to manually move the wheel that appeared to be stuck, then it prints fine.  Only draw back to that fix is it repeats the problem at random and this morning (for the second time) it ruined an entire batch of coupons my wife prints to buy groceries...in a typical shopping trip she saves between $50-75 per store.  There are limits on how many you can print so we are left with useless coupons that cannot be reprinted....this cartridge has actually cost us more money than we paid for it.....throwing it out and getting a real cartridge ASAP",0,0

REWAWDC49JWKI,"I'm looking at my Amazon ink orders and how the cheap but highly functional ""off-brand"" ink lasts me over 6 months, and then I thought to order a set of the more expensive HP ink which ran out at about 7 weeks, not a cost-effective move.Even if the off-brand ink eventually messes up the printer (which it does not appear to do), it's cheaper to replace the printer than to keep using HP ink. And I agree with another reviewer, that the HP automatic ink refill program is a rip off—unless you want to make it yet another priority in your life to either stay on top of your HP ink use and pages you print with it, or pay HP for all the ink service.

R2X638H5X9R2CR,"I bought a set of the two compartment meal prep containers to take lunches to work, on road trips, etc. The glass container itself is very heavy and sturdy and easy to clean, but on day one I have two main issues:The lids are a flimsy cheap plastic, on the level of the disposable containers from the dollar store. They warp and bend easily and are the kind of oily feeling plastic that stains and holds smells. The seal is glued into the lid and can't be removed for cleaning so any food particles that get in there will never come out. You can't put these lids in the microwave or oven, though some other reviews say you can freeze them.The divider in the glass container only goes halfway up, defeating the purpose of having it at all. If the container tilts at all the contents of the two compartments spill into each other. The container is awkwardly large and does not fit into most lunch boxes unless you tip it on its side, at which point it's pretty much one container. If I had seen these containers first I would never have bought them and I will avoid this brand in the future. You can get much better containers for less money from several other brands.

It still writes, but I have to hold it at an awkward angle (almost straight up and down) or it’s very light and/or skips. I do not use a lot of pressure when I write either.So if you are getting these for ocassional use for doodles in a journal or planner, they would probably hold up okay if you were careful.

The only good news at this point is that I was able to remove the flag gear & spring and transfer it to the original Brother starter cartridge, which still has plenty of toner left in it.

RF9U2JBVLT9GN,"This was on sale, and the idea of real wood vs. particle board was appealing. I should have known better.First, it is small. I knew this going in, and wanted a smaller unit, so no problems there for me, but if you are looking for a lot of storage, I would look elsewhere.Now the problems:On unpacking it, I noticed that the boards felt very light - they are pine, but they might as well be balsa wood. I decided to give it a shot rather than returning it immediately.On the very first step, placing the wheels into one of the bottom support  boards split it in half down the middle. This was while following the instructions to use padding when putting the hardware in. I requested a replacement piece from the manufacturer, which took two 2 weeks.Once I finally got that back, I picked up assembly where I left off. The wood is so soft that you have to be extremely careful not to overt tighten screws (even by hand), because it can drive the screws too deep into the attached boards and cause chips and cracks.The next thing to go wrong was placing the top on. The holes were not aligned correctly and one of the wooden dowels was too thick, so it was a struggle getting it attached. Just applying force to seat the top correctly created a new crack in the top.Attaching the back to the cabinet and the bottoms to the drawers involves driving small nails into narrow strips of wood. These are much too small, and even a slight miscalculation results in the nails splitting the wood or coming out of the side. Again, the wood is much too soft, so splitting chips out even with these tiny nails is a real possibility.Finally, even after making sure everything was square as per the instructions, the cart wobbles, and all of the drawers stick at points sliding them in and out.I like the concept of using real wood but this is just not well designed, not is it sturdy enough. I saw a reviewer is putting their printer on it - I would not trust this unit to bear up under more than a couple of pounds. To be fair, it's only rated for 10lbs on top - which should give you some idea how flimsy it really is.Save yourself some headaches, and get something a bit more expensive - better that than the frustration of assembling this and the frankly poor end result.",0,0

RH9QYNGELYZGA,"These are expensive and it (SILVER PAINT) worked great right out of the box.When I started using it, I gave it a 5⭐️review.After all, I do love SHARPIE markers.HOWEVER, after a few months, the tip wouldn't pass paint anymore and the paint simply blobs and drips out of the wick❗️Even if the fine-tip has paint in it, something is plugging up the very end of the tip so that the paint will not transfer onto the item you are writing on.Other reviewers have shared similar experiences.The tip works as two pieces:A thicker paint-absobing cylindrical ""wick"" fits into the metal cup holding the fine-tip-wick.  By drepressing the tip into marker, paint is suppused to get wicked up and flow into the fine-point-tip where you can use it like a pen.It works very well, AT FIRST.The entire wick-tip assembly became so loose that it easily popped off of the marker when trying to clean it.Shaking; dabbing; trying different angles; nothing would get the fine-tip to smoothly run the paint anymore after less than 9 months of ownership.The marker shakes just fine, and the paint is very fluid.BUT NOW THE PAINT SIMPLY FLOWS AROUND THE BIG WICK AND DRIPS A BIG BLOP OF PAINT DOWN AND OVER THE FINE-POINT.It uses very little paint when working, so it can last for a very long time, BUT WHAT GOOD IS IT IF IT WON'T WORK AFTER A FEW USES?I tried cleaning the fine-point-tip with alcohol.It cleaned up perfectly, it absorbed paint again, but it still wouldn't flow properly through the tip as it did when first purchased.It seems as if the end of the tip hardens and acts like a plug on the paint trying to flow through it.Either way, WHAT IS WRONG WITH THESE THINGS!",0,0
R2SXANG02Z3NB2,"It's very hard to ""at a glance"" see which child is supposed to do what chore. Two of the colors are so close in coloring that it's very difficult to determine who is who. It wouldn't be a problem if you could dictate to your children which colors they could use (and if you didn't need all four colors for four children): however, my three chose their own colors and of course two of them are closely matched. I find myself spending too much time looking at it to try and determine who is supposed to be doing what. If the stars were bigger and of different colors - perhaps this would be a good choice. I also purchased other chore charts which I like much better (they are for each individual child) - but I still need one for those chores that they share during the week.",0,0

RSGLQ6FY4O383,"Took a while for these to get here, but hey, this is the price you pay when you're too lazy and cheap to go to your friendly neighborhood office supply store and get brand new ones yourself.  Some people call that cheap... we like to call it thrifty around here.  This is a situation where thrifty didn't pan out quite as expected...Our black ink cartridge was the only thing that had run out at the time I placed this order, although the others were starting to get low.  Being the savvy planner I am, I decided it would be best to stock up on everything all at once, since printers have a tendency to run out of ink at the most inopportune times and I wanted to have them on standby.  After we replaced the black cartridge, it worked fine for printing 5 sheets of paper.  Then, the lines started.  And they got worse and worse and worse, to the point where you couldn't read anything being printed.  Finally, we reserved ourselves to the fact that it had to be a dud, and we replaced it with the other one.  It now prints gray instead of black... but hey, at least it's printing text that is actually readable (how's THAT for the silver lining in the cloud?).When we tried to replace the color cartridges with these new ones, oh the delight that we were able to experience.  The ink leaked EVERYWHERE.  It dripped on the carpet and stained fingers.  Since this happened last weekend and Easter is this upcoming weekend, I came up with the explanation if anyone asked that it was an accident dying Easter eggs.  Thankfully, no one asked.  I can't imagine the looks we would've gotten considering that we are two grown adults with no young children.  I'm still trying to get the ink out of the carpet and it took a few days for the skin to return to it's natural hue.  We have the same problem with the color cartridges as the original black cartridge - there are lines everywhere from the ink not printing properly.  The silver lining with the color cartridges?  The color is a nightmare to get of the carpet and off the skin, so at least you know it's good quality.I wouldn't recommend these cartridges at all.  There were so many other positive reviews that I can't understand what happened here.  All I know is that we won't be ordering any more of them.",0,0

This fixed it for a few days, rinse and repeat...  Each time it became harder and harder to get this cartridge to print anything, eventually it just stopped and I couldn't get it to work.

RXZAND5FLR8WD,"I bought this ink because I visited their booth at the Commowealth Pen Show, but they didn’t allow testing of their inks or pens at the show (go figure) and I didn’t feel they did their job selling the product. So I purchased from amazon. This ink does not work well for pointed nib calligraphy. The ink bleeds terribly even in good 32# paper. I also purchased a black one if this brand and it performs well. It is not water fast at all. I also used it in a medium fountain pen (rotring and Lamy) and was also a poor performer.As you can see from the pictures, I compared 4 inks on the back of a good quality envelope that usually takes calligraphy inks quite well. The black Noodler’s ink is perfect, the Bad Belter Kingfisher was terrible.  The Winsor and Newton had a little bit of feathering and the Pelican was ok. I waited 1 minute and then placed one drop of water. You can see the Kingfisher starts spreading right away while the black one kept its fastness. After 1 minute All but the black ink were ruined.I read great reviews of these inks and now I am confused if they are all different formulations and there’s not a lot of description on the box or the bottle.",0,0

R3SN7TVBQPRANX,Not sure why this has such high reviews. It doesn't apply flat and there are HUGE bubbles no matter what I do. Probably has something to do with the fact that the roll wasn't very flat to begin with. I unrolled almost the whole tube and weighed down the edges to try and flatten it some. There were folds in the roll that stayed no matter what I did. Still got 2 stars because its a wonderful idea and the adhesive is so damn good that I couldn't peel it back after placing it without warping the sheeting.

RDM0YNNEWQ240,"I like the intentionality that this type of planner can support, but there are too many mistakes and poor design desicisions to have this work for me ... so I’m heading to other alternatives on the market.This is not a yearly, weekly or monthly planner. It is only focused on looking ahead each day. There are sections for weeks and months but those are retrospective and not forward-looking.The weekly review has many very detailed questions that are phrased, oddly, in reference to “today” versus “this week.” It appears to be a quality-control oversight. Also, the detail level of those questions are indeed more appropriate for a daily review than a weekly review, so it looks like they’ve taken a daily review list from another iteration of the design and slapped it into the weekly review section.As other reviewers have said, there is a lot of real estate on each page dedicated to the daily schedule, while the other areas are quite cramped, and the daily schedule only goes up to early evening.The difference between “Today’s Top 3 Goals/Priorities” and “Tasks that Absolutely Must Be Done Today” is not clear. The author has a video where he addresses this and criticizes those who could be confused by this, going on to give a very vague and not really credible description of the difference.When I contacted the company’s customer service email about some of these issues, they were evasive and pointed me to a facebook group of “Brandon’s Students.”Finally, I’m not a big fan of self-proclaimed gurus who are marketing their stuff by saying “you too can be as productive as me.”Onward to Panda Planner Pro or another option.

R3AWRJMKQ3QGO2,"Pros:1. It is made of wood.2. Great for a DYI project!!!3. it is technically a drawer.4. It is very aromatic!5. You are saving those rejected wood scraps from your lumber yard!Cons:1. By made of wood, it really means the rejected wood pieces from the lumberyard. You know when you pick up lumber from your local place and you toss out a bunch of those pieces, those get marked down and the worse gets left behind, yep those pieces. You will be hard pressed to find any piece that is not full of knots and warped in some way (and leaking a bit of sap, how authentic!). At least they picked the lightest, softest, and easiest to break or split wood they could find, to save on shipping costs of course.2.  If you thought you were buying a ready to assemble drawer, well you might be disappointed. For instance they really don't tell you about all the tools you will really need: A good drill with a screw driver attachment, a square, glue, a couple of hammers, some extra nails, two or three good grades of sand paper, two cans of clear coat, and a good amount of patience. This would have been better described as a DYI kit, and by DYI I mean drill your own holes and figure out how to put it together yourself. I know there are some 5 star reviews out there... but I am not sure how this made them that happy... maybe they got it free or something.3. There appears to be ZERO quality assurance since about 40% of the holes they did actually drill were in the wrong spots making the simple task of hammering in the cheap plastic drawer slides, yep for that real wood experience they couldn't afford to toss in real drawer slides. But hey good thing I was able to fill that hole and re-drill another one! I really don't think that any of this was sanded, or I am just very unlucky with finding stray splinters.4. If you were expecting this bad boy to be painted, you are missing that true 100% wood DYI experience! More like one coat of spray on black primer. Combined with the unique softness of a true hardwood like pine even slight dings bring out the true rich tones of tan.5. As an extra bonus you get a fancy big sticker on the back piece of... particle board that refused to let loose without a ton of scraping and adhesive removal (at least they used glue here). Apparently that sticker is very important as it reminds you that the drawers cannot hold more than 10 pounds.In conclusion, skip the real wood experience and buy a drawer that yes, might be made with pressed wood, but also comes fully finished with mechanical drawers and doesn't leak sap!",0,0

R140CV744P7CIQ,"This scale was purchased to integrate with WorldShip so that we wouldn't have to type in the weight of every single package. The integration went fine (a small ""hack"" in a bin file had it up and running fast).But, there's one major problem with this scale - it doesn't display accurate weights. The manual states that accuracy can fluctuate +/- 4 oz, which is a problem in itself for shipping purposes (since everything rounds up for billing), but the variances are far greater than 4 oz. The heavier the package, the more the variance. We've run into instances where the weight displayed was more than 4 lb off. That might not seem like a big deal at ground shipping rates, but a difference that high when using an air service and shipping to a residential address can result in tens of dollars in shipping rate differences.After about a month of 20 page shipping company invoices with rate adjustments due to inaccurate weights, we promptly tossed this thing in the trash.",0,0

R3J20N2RT9P2YW,"There were a few Smash accessories I wanted and I bought a kit that came with most of them and a few extras, including a ""free"" larger book.  I say ""free"" because the kit cost less than buying the accessories I wanted individually, so I looked at the other items as freebies on top of a good price.The Smash Swatch Tape was one of the items I wanted to add some variety to the black polka dot tape, which I love.  Now, I'm glad I got the swatch tape as part of the kit and I consider the cute clips part of what I bought and the Swatch Tape a freebie so I don't feel bad that I threw it away.  As was true with several reviewers here, the tape stuck to the next layer, ruining that layer and split apart as I tried to take it off the roll.  VERY disappointing and very poor quality.  I expected that the Swatch Tape would be the same material as the black dot paper tape.  So I pitched the useless roll of Swatch Tape and I'll buy Trendy Tape from Queen and Company dot com.

R20WDW9T0Z254U,"I wasn't quite sure what to expect from these, for the price.  But this is a case of paying a premium for a name, not for anything physically worth it.These are just your normal, standard notebooks, with cardboard covers that will bend and crease and wear just like any others, marring the pictures pretty quickly in any normal school use.  Seeing what my 11 year old son ends up with for his notebooks and folders in the course of just a month or two, these wouldn't make the grade.New, they do look nice.  Bright colors, well done, no blurring, the print job is excellent.  The paper is pretty standard, perforated if you prefer the clean edge rather than the ragged one you get just pulling out from the spiral.But others have already pointed out how much cheaper these can be found singly, so the three pack is definitely not worth the price.And if these are going to go to little kids, which is the most likely candidate since these are kind of ""kid"" quality art being Star Wars Rebel cartoon images (i.e. you won't get an adult Star Wars fan using these for anything), then these really won't have much of a chance at longevity.If you need notebooks for your kid for school, these aren't the ones I'd pick.  If you need something for around the house for them though, something that won't be in and out of backpacks and desks and lockers, then these may hold their form and looks for a while.  But I'd definitely not use them as ones getting packed back and forth each day",0,0

R1UHDPV0B83W4N,I just cannot understand how this pen is rated so highly.Like others I bought the pen based upon the many glowing recommendations for a beginners fountain pen.Overall the writing experience is v poor:(i) the fine pen nib continually runs dry. I am using the converter with Lamy Crystal Black Ink.There are no air bubbles in the converter and I have to violently shake the pen to generate ink flow and end up with ink blots on the paper(ii) Super scratchy. I am mean ultra scratchy. The idea of the fountain pen is to glide over the page effortlessly.This is made worse by the tendency of the nib to run dry.(iii) Posting the pen.When writing the pen feels more balanced when the cap is fitted to the back of the pen. However it fits v poorly. Not nice and snug at all.It either ends up rattling on the end of the pen as your write or you have to post it so tightly it is difficult to get off when you are finished.(iv) The paint is so thin any small scratch reveals the shiny aluminium underneath.This is especially noticeable  at the end of the pen because you have to press so hard to firmly post the cap it wears the paint from the end of the pen.The Lamy AL Star is one of the most expensive beginners fountain pen but the experience and build quality feels v cheap and nasty to me.,0,0

I guess I was wrong, and that the problem persists with many of the products that are shipped, at least it was the case with mine.

For the innovation of the product and 2. for their nice customer service.But as far as the product itself, it's not the best use of my money and I wouldn't recommend it to a friend. I received the folio and noticed that the pen loop was very large, it can hold 2-3 pens before it starts to stretch and it can hold 6+ pens (I put 5 in there and there was room for a 6th, I just didn't have that many on me). When I contacted customer service they said that this was the intended design and that pens clip to the outside.I've never seen a pen loop in a folio case require the pen to be outside of it, poor design if you ask me. Please post more pictures indicating the intentional use of this loop on the posting.Along with that the one side is starting to bow on me.

The reviews for this pen look good and the fact that it is commended for ease-of-use by the Arthritis Foundation made it seem like this would be the pen for her.  She thought it was a pretty decent pen that was more comfortable to hold and use compared to the pens she's been using.  She likes the purple/blue color of the pen and the quality of the ink, but it started leaking after only a couple of uses.

I had the pleasure of sitting down and reviewing my receipts for both items today, shipped seperately of course, and was a bit baffled. Both of these items were sold for a reasonable price for about $7. Here's where my anger lies: Amazon sent me the ADDRESS SERVICE REQUESTED Rubber Stamp and the shipping & handling was free...and ""NO"" to all of the website sleuths out there; it WAS NOT part of any large purchase over $25 including free shipping. However, this company that my daughter purchased the RETURN TO SENDER Rubber Stamp from chose to charge her/me about $6 for shipping & handling alone. It weighs about as much as two loaded envelopes and took over a week to get...so you tell me where this fee is justified!!! Yes, in the future I will manage all Amazon purchases on my own, a lesson has been learned.

R2P1L1OD77A9ET,"I wanted to love these pens... I really did. The price was so incredible, when I ordered them. I read so many other reviews, but thought, hey, if I dont like them, it's less than a $20 bill, right? I ignored the negative reviews and ordered anyway. One swipe, and I knew these would not be suitable for beginner to intermediate hand lettering. Not even a little bit. I played with them (along with some water) for about an hour, and that was it. They were frustrating, and I knew they weren't for me. So, they were passed on to my daughter, who has dabbled in water color painting lately. I had no doubt she would love and want to keep them. Even SHE said I should return them. And so I shall. Why? Briefly...First, the results differ from pen to pen.  One pen might write fairly dark. The next will be nearly dry. And on and on. Second, the tips are literally brushes, not nylon ""brush"" tips. They're impossible to control for hand lettering, unless you're a pro. Third, bristles were loose and/or falling out. And less important, but still a factor --the packaging, as some have mentioned, is terrible. And on top of being awkward and flimsy, the outer sleeve of mine arrived broken and somewhat mangled. This is possibly (read: likely) the fault of the shipping facility, so that did not factor into my rating.  Don't do what I did, in ignoring the other reviews. Save yourself the hassle of returning, and the frustration and disappointment!!!",1,1

But I began to see streaking in the colors that I printed, which was unaffected by running a cleaning cycle on the printer, changing paper, changing print quality, etc.  After some quick research online, I learned that a common cause of this is cheaply made toner cartridges.  After changing the cartridge, VOILA!  Smooth printing again.

R1RG1QLYOBRBR,"I bought Liquid Bearings to use on my computer trackball.  When my trackball was new, it rolled perfectly.  Over time I've had to exert more effort to get the ball rolling, which results in jerky movement.  The manufacturer no longer makes my trackball or sells replacement parts, so I thought I'd lubricate the bearings to see if it would help.I first tried skin oil (like from my forehead).  It only helped for a few hours.  I had the same result with olive oil, coconut oil, teflon gun oil, and even polishing the ball with RainX.  Nothing seemed to work for more than a few hours at best.  I even made sure to thoroughly clean the ball between each test.Enter Liquid Bearings.  It received a lot of great reviews and they mention on their site that it's good for arcade machines.  Since many arcade machines have trackballs, I thought it might work.It doesn't.It didn't help at all.  In fact, it made it much much worse.  It also smelled.  They claim it has no odor, but it does.  It's not overpowering, but it's there.Since every other oil I tried worked better, but since it may still be useful for oiling hinges or other stuff in the future, I think 2/5 stars is what it deserves.

A few weeks after getting this for my daughter we bought one for a friend as a birthday gift from a local store. The boards were nice a straight - no warping and the magnetic years started at 2011. The identical item but in much better shape. I guess I blame Amazon for sending something out that was in bad shape and apparently sitting around for a few years. If not for it being old and in bad condition I would have given it 5 stars.,0,0
R3W0UGB5FJG9IF,The clips themselves are really nice but my pack was missing one. Wasn’t until close to the end of the project that I noticed. Now my project is incomplete and I still need a single clip but can’t buy just one. If the product had come as advertised with the correct number of clips would be 5 stars.,0,0
R2P4QOOLH5EVPZ,"I really did not enjoy working with these pencils. I found them really chalky (pieces of lead were breaking on my page), the color didn't fill in or build up easily, and I personally did not enjoy using a triangular barrel. I honestly prefer Crayola over these, which are cheaper and easily found in most stores.I also found that the wood on these were very soft and would just peel back from the lead. I'm not sure if that affects anything, though it was odd.Overall I really did dislike these pencils.  I hate the page I started so much that as of now I don't plan to finish it.  I would never buy these again and I would not recommend them.  The pictures I added show some fine detail that I used gel pens for,  but mainly it is just the use of these pencils.

I tried opening 4 or 5 gently, threw a handful of 20-30 onto the ground in frustration, calmed down, grabbed another dozen or so, and tried more experimental methods, like heating the glue with a hairdryer. Now another 20-30 have been Gronk-spiked to my office floor. I regret to say, the entire supply is a loss, unless one counts their use as a victimless target of rage a catharsis of some value.

No matter what I tried I could not get rid of the crease. This product will NOT static cling to a whiteboard. I gave it two stars because it is still a good tool to use for teaching. It is large enough for all my students to see and it is easy to erase. I have to tape and untape it frequently to/from the board which has caused damage and this will not last long.

These two sections take about 40% of the two-page daily spread. Way too much, in my opinion.I do however like the weekly two-page weekly review.

RBITY5S5SFWNM,We loved this pencil sharpener until it quit working after 5 months. When I plugged it in today it would not even turn and I made sure the outlet was working. If the sharpener would last longer I would have given it 5 stars. It sharpens pencils better than most and has more power. I normally buy these for gifts for my children's teachers because they do not provide pencil sharpeners in each classroom. I would hate to think there's have quit only after a few months.,0,0

R1O0L1TOQP5V14,"The following is my review for this brand's toner that I purchased with the drum.  Since the drum and the toner work together and I can't pinpoint which of the two items (or both) are causing my issues, I'm simply copying and pasting my toner review here:""I felt compelled to write this review:  Sometimes when a see a couple of negative reviews, but the majority of reviews are good, I decide to take a chance and purchase.  This was the case here, but it was a mistake.  The other negative reviews regarding leaking are absolutely correct.  Here was my experience:I saw this brand on sale when it was the ""Deal of the Day.""  I have a Brother MFC-8950DW, so I purchased the matching toner and drum unit.  At first, the printing appeared nice.  However, the toner smudges VERY easily.  So, when I went to scan various documents, the toner smudged and I had to reprint almost 100 pages and then rescan them.  This wasted about 30 minutes of my time.  However, the worst happened a couple of days after installing the toner and drum...the toner began leaking.  There were blotches of toner over the paper.  Based on another reviewer stating that the leaking ruined his printer, I quickly removed the toner and drum and replaced it with the original drum and toner I had, since there was some life left in them.  The blotches continued for the next 5-10 pages or so, but then stopped...thank goodness!When packaging up the toner and drum to return to Amazon, the toner leaked out and covered my hands.So, if you are on the fence like I was regarding this company and their printer accessories, do yourself a huge favor and don't make the same mistake I did by taking a chance.  Stay far away!It's too bad because the Brother accessories are so overpriced.  I tried another off-brand toner with the Brother drum (this is the toner I was aiming to replace), but the printing is much lighter than the Brother toner.  At least it isn't leaking, though.  So, I still haven't found off-brand Brother accessories with quality equivalent to the Brother accessories.  At this point, I'm thinking about ponying up the money for the Brother-branded items since right now I'm paying the price of wasting my time and dealing with cruddy-quality prints in exchange for saving some money up front on the items themselves.""",0,0

I also use these pens for art which includes watercolors that need definition and cartooning. They can be a joy to use. These werw not as bikd as I hoped and the ink tended to stagger early in.

I thought surely they would need to do a reprint. I was told that I got the Catholic calendar, and that is the only calendar without the Jewish holidays. Now this particular calendar has Bible verses (which is the main reason I ordered it), from Psalms and Proverbs as well as the New Testament. I was floored at her answer. I said that Scripture verses are not exclusively Catholic, and that I am not Catholic or Jewish either, but I am appalled. She said they make over 70 calendars and that this is the only one without the Jewish holidays. I told her that she was not making this conversation go any better,  that I am the wife of a Messianic Jew, and we are both shocked and appalled. Anti-Semitism has no place here. From now on, I will choose another company.",0,0
R3NJOOKYVLWDIF,"I purchased two of these cartridges a little less than a year ago, so this review speaks volumes about the longevity of this product.When I initially installed and started using this product, I would have given it five stars in a heartbeat. It worked great for about 4 or 5 months, but then the issues began. I started getting streaking toner and what looked like low toner levels (after ~400 pages). I am a tech savvy grad student, so I did all of the troubleshooting including cleaning the cartridge, shaking it, reinstalling, etc. The cartridge had most of the toner remaining in it, but I could not get it to print without issues. Nothing worked.I finally gave up and installed the second cartridge. It worked like a charm......for about 4 or 5 months. The same issues with streaking and light printing started occurring with this cartridge as well. I print about 1000 pages per year, so these two cartridges should have lasted (theoretically) 5 years. In reality, they lasted less than a year.If you do the math, the price per page is equivalent to the Brother cartridge, which is disappointing. I am about to purchase a different set of non-oem cartridges to see if they work any better. I'll leave a review on those in a year or two!",0,0

I am sick of gray text and will have to pay the big bucks for a real replacement. I am surprised this got good reviews from anyone, so maybe mine is a dud. We tried shaking the toner cartridge (age-old trick) and reinserting it a few times, but it just prints documents in medium gray.",0,0

R21WT2J2VMR6J8,Bought it twice and  two times the line broke. The first time I thought maybe a bad reel. The second one didnt even last a month. The reel casing is metal instead of the usual plastic reels but the line is weak and it breaks. You just end up getting stuck with a heavy duty reel and a completely retracted line therfore rendering the reel useless. Maybe could be used paper weight but I am sure that is not the reason you are reading this review. Someone needs to revisit the design and use a different material  for the line instead of the flimsy one being used now. Only then it would be a heavy duty reel.,0,0
R2IN0Z4WLC6O89,I got this for my grandchild and she could not use chalk on it because it looked like it had wax on it and one side broke so needless to say the trash dumpster received another product.unfortunately you have to make a rating on this produt but the one star should be a zero star.,0,0

There was 1004 silver tabs, 19 big random tabs, 92 colored tabs and 2 broken can tabs. I read in the description that these would have been washed prior to being sent. My fingers say otherwise.

R8NCC413PAWLA,"There is a great deal of difference between ""Remanufactured"" and simply filling an empty cartridge with ink. I do not believe that this company knows the difference. I  bought two cartridges. I tried both of them 3.5 months later. BOTH of them had dry and crusted ink between the printhead and stuck onto the rubber sponge in the holder. It was stuck SO hard that in spite of very slow removal, the printhead ripped the rubber sponge and tore part off. I wrote an honest and sensible letter to the manufacturer and told them of my difficulties. I was met with a FIRM ""Those cartridges are only warranted for 90 days. You are over that. I'm sorry, but there is NOTHING I can do for you."" Allrighty then! So much for THIS company and the member of their ""customer satisfaction TEAM.""My experience with MANY different printers and cartridges are that on a new sealed cartridge that is as old as 4 YEARS out of date that the cartridge performs PERFECTLY. One would think that a genuine REMANUFACTURED item would work out of the sealed container at LEAST 6 months later. Not so on these worthless items. It is difficult to believe that the company would not at least offer me a replacement set after I returned these. They refused to talk about these cartridges any further than they already had. Take a peek at the one star ratings. There are almost as many 1 ratings as 5 ratings. Perhaps they have two shifts? One shift with someone that knows something about refilling or REMANUFACTURING and one that is told to ""fillerup"".  You decide. I am relating ONLY my personal experience with this company.",0,0

A bit awkward to adjust, if you plan on using it in different places and positions it could be a real pain to adjust constantly.",0,0
R6Y90JL63UYTJ,They work and they are regular pens nothing special. I rate them low because of the hype that they didn't live up to. I also don't like the way the ink clumps up on the tip and I have to clean it off before use. Some of the pens are worst than other so this just adds inconsistency to mix. So for less than a buck it will do but I have owned better for the same or less cost.,0,0

RHXM3860P0GV2,"I've purchased several sets of nylon brush tip markers and these are by far the worst.  Im so disappointed and I've already set up the return.  Im uploading a photo to demonstrate my primary issues.  The first is most easily visible: the brush tips split apart.  Add that to the fact that some of the markers aren't very ""juicy"", and you get markers that aren't consistently useful unless you plan to blend them with a water brush every time.My biggest complaint is the ink.  It's terrible.  I swatched every color in the box,  and while some blend well,  many do not.  I read other reviews that said you have to use specific paper with these markers...i tried both the Strathmore 90lb watercolor visual journal paper and the Strathmore Bristol Smooth surface paper.  The performance was better on the smooth surface paper  (which is not the point of watercolor markers), but even then some colors like A188 wisteria purple just wouldn't blend. Don't waste your time or money on these.",0,0

Does not come with any kind of hanging device other than some 3M PERMANENT hanging stickers. THESE WILL TEAR PAINT FROM WALLS, you have been warned.

R1JTAG4UMHK97F,"There is no measurement, which is fine, but at its widest point it makes 7.5"" circles, not 8"" circles, so if you're looking for a true 8"" compass, look elsewhere. There are caps on the ends of of the center screw that prevent it from going to 4"". When I remove those caps and put it to 4"" the whole thing literally falls apart. It comes in a nice zip closure package and looks presentable, if using it for 7.5"" or less it's acceptable. Hence, 2 stars. Not quite as advertised, but decent enough for what it is.",0,0
R14V03XQMDJQXA,"Ill admit to not having too much experience with fountain pens, but no pen should be this hard to write with.  The first time I received this it was completely dysfunctional.  The ink that came with the pen ran to the point of leaving a small puddle on my desk after leaving it unattended for five minutes.  My own noodlers ink however simply did not work at all.  After I got a replacement for this one thinking that it was just a one time thing I was only partially right.  While the provided ink still dripped like a water faucet my noodlers ink worked after almost thirty minutes of coaxing.  Since then I have only refilled it twice but it has never smoothly gone through a full cartridge without drying out for no plain reason.  I have a cheap little plastic fountain pen that so far works without fail and uses the ink cartridges that this pen couldn't without issue.  Based on other reviews I would say that my pen just has issues.  While it doesn't work like it should, when the ink does run nicely it is a great pen that I love to use... right up until it stops working again.",0,0

R171CZ9C136ME7,"My wife has used this cart for a year now.  We are aware of the other negative reviews that said the cart can easily tip over on any uneven surfaces and we were careful about it.  However, last week, when my wife was returning home from a grocery trip, the front wheel tripped over a small uneven part on of the sidewalk.  She fell forward and landed on top of the cart.  She severely injured herself with large bruises on both legs.  I wasn't there and she was left by herself to limp back home with a cart full of groceries.  This cart is good when you're at the supermarket with level surfaces, but it can be treacherous when you use it outside.  Any small bump on the sidewalk would stop this cart and there'd be a good chance you'll stumble or fall.  We're not going to use this anymore and I'm going to look for a better alternative.",0,0

I'm really bummed out because I really wanted this to work for me, but I ended up throwing it away after only using it a few times. It was a great concept, but it just did not live up to what I had read about it. Overall, I would not recommend this desk for purchase.",0,0
R210WOSKDIF8JF,This planner is infuriating. Did anybody in the design team realize that they should have put  “Month Ahead At A Glance” in the front of the book and then the “Monthly Review” at the end of the month. And the same layout for the next 30 days.Some of the things the ask you to record are repetitive. There’s also no section for just random notes you may need. It needs to be simplified.I appreciate what the book says but from a design background/perspective I can’t get over the layout. I wanted this book to feel like it was MADE FOR ME. This feeling that just hits my heart and makes the book feel like my personal assistant but they honestly dropped the ball.I really wanted to like this book. I hope someone from the design team sees this and makes a 2.0 version. I would buy it then I think. Unfortunately I already started writing in it before I realized it so I can’t return it. Maybe I’ll just make a copy of the month ahead and staple it to a page in the front so the book will work then. Idk.,0,0

R18PWC2K0K6J6Z,"I opened the first cartridge and spewed ink all over my beige  carpet as well as all over my hands.  I printed two pages.  Neither printed well.

I took out the second cartridge, this time holding it over my computer desk - I now have ink splattered all over my desk, as well as some papers I was working on.  Oh yeah - my hands are covered again.  All I did was remove the orange tray they are shipped in.  I am beyond angry.  The one star rating is way too high.  I don't think there is anything that will take the ink out of my carpet.  When I tried to blot it up it just spread around.  If you buy this garbage my suggestion is to be VERY careful when you take the packing tray off.  Unless you don't mind having everything splattered with black ink.  And two pages per cartridge,  Give me a break.",0,0
R2A88AIAQA3L9R,"Only reason why I am giving it a 2 star is because it worked right out of the box and installed pretty easy.  The trouble is that after no more than 5000 prints, it's now printing light vertical stripes to light streaks up and down in 3 column on every page.  It turns out that this is a COMMON problem reported by many Xerox ColorQube customers.  They walk you through a process of cleaning, running cleaning page, we even replaced the maintenance kit, check the debris tray.  We have done everything!  This printer is a piece of s***  People beware...again this is a common problem as we discovered but it's too late to return.  Oh, well now we've learned.  I honestly think they should recall this printer and swap out customers devices with newer & working Xerox color printer.  I have been loyal Xerox customers for over 20 years and now we're surprised to find these qualities is not representative of what the company and the brand have always stood for.",0,0

R24E9VLZAXT02B,I wouldn't buy this again.1.  The instructions don't tell you how to dump the shavings.  (You squeeze at the right place on the shavings bucket -- that's on upper corners.  There are no markings there -- you have to know.)2.  It doesn't work on normal size round pencils.  The hole is fractionally under 8mm so the 8mm ones (common colored pencils made in metric system countries)  have to be forced in using two hands and it's all but impossible to turn the pencil while sharpening as several reviewers recommend.In theory you could use a rat-tail file to slightly enlarge the cover and inside holes.  In practice the switch that turns the thing on sticks into the inside hole so if you file down there you'll likely disable the thing.Might be okay if all you have is the (smaller)  standard hex leadpencil.,0,0

R1I08PKQ06WQ6W,"Purchased 2/7/15, date of review 3/23/15.  Wish I would have read other reviews before purchasing.  This sign is not 24X14.  It is 21X12, which is perfectly fine with me.  For the first few weeks I was happy with the overall functionality of the sign.  I like that is is oval and that the blue lights will create a movement to catch people's eye.  However, less than 2 months after purchasing the sign, it has malfunctioned.  The red lights do not stay consistently bright.  Sometimes the O and the P are dim while the E and N are bright.  Other times, the E and N are dim while the O and P are bright.  The chain that came with the light was not long enough for my situation, but I purchased a chain at a local hobby store that worked great.  Now, if the sign would just work properly, I would be happy.  Contacting the seller today to see what they are willing to do.  I will update this when I see what their response is.UPDATE 4/10/2015.  I was given a refund by Amazon for the 1st defective light, in late March.  Stupidly, I decided to give the light another chance, but from a different seller (as advised by Amazon).  The 2nd light, which was received from a different seller was received not working.  It also had 2 letters that would not light.  That seller sent me a replacement (making this my 3rd one!!!) and it was GREAT for a WEEK!!!  After just ONE WEEK,  the blue lights around the letters STOPPED WORKING!!!! I do NOT recommend this product!!! It should be BANNED FROM AMAZON!!!  Today, I had to file a complaint with Amazon due to the poor service of the company involved.  Guess I will be purchasing a sign locally for over $100.  Guess the old saying is true, ""You get what you pay for!""!!!",1,1
RRF0HLVMA6TYH,"To echo prior reviews, it is a gamble when you order these, as to how many cartridges will work for the long term.  The review should probably be 2.5 starts, since these are just okay, and we continue to order them despite problems.  I have purchased these several times through my prime account and through our office account, and have occasionally had the entire package of cartridges work, but more often one or two of the color cartridges fails / leaks / streaks or stops being recognized by the printer.  Occasionally the problem occurs right away after installation, but more often than not the problem crops up about one week into use.  LD is mostly pretty good about replacing a defective cartridge, but sometimes because we order the larger packs, we don't install the cartridges right away.  So, while the price is great (about a third of the OEM), the savings has to be balanced against the time lost to fiddling around with the cartridges and trying to clean them and get them to keep producing; the time lost dealing with replacing the cartridge(s); the time lost while the HP printer pauses and goes into cleaning mode (sometimes two or three times on a 100 page copying job); and the frustration of having the printer become useless when we have critical color print jobs.",0,0
